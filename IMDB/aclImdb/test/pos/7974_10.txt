hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste even though it is no worse than many films nevertheless i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery  all but the storyline was very weak and i couldnt really see the point of it all however the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster filmbr br where did the guys nate  noah cryns who wrote this music come from they are awesome from the moment the music begins it is by far better than anything ive heard in years i think it may be the best ive ever heard even though i wasnt thrilled with the action taking place on the film the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was reliving those old days through the musicbr br this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again
