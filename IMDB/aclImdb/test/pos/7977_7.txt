i really enjoyed watching hell to pay ive been a fan of westerns for as long as i can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the westerns from the 1960s even though i was too young to have seen them in their first run the one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music it was distracting at times one thing i did notice and i wonder how many other fans of gunsmoke noticed was the name of buck taylors character it was a play on doc adams name from gunsmoke instead of gaylan adams buck taylor used adam galen i wonder if that was his choice or chris mcintyres anyway i would recommend this movie to fans of westerns dont expect anything too deep just plain old entertainment
