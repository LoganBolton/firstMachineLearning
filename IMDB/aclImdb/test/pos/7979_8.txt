for a long time this was my favorite of the batman films it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters  catwomen and the penguin  along with the alwaysinteresting christopher walken however after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and frankly i now prefer the last batman batman begins with christian balebr br the good  nonetheless this is still the most intriguing of the five latterday batman films the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals as this is a great example the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting almost fascinating of the villains i preferred catwomen finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this as he did in the first film michael keaton does a fine job playing batmanbruce waynebr br the bad  for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read i still think these first two batman movies both done by burton were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate although unlike the first movie there was no usage of the lords name in vain in here there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks that would have been okay if they hadnt marketed this film for kids as well as adults danny devitos penguin is downright gross in spots grotesque i can handle but who wants gross few guys meanwhile complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing catwoman generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian bashing also made me reconsider my previouslyhigh rating of this filmbr br overall  fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series but toodark an edge too gross and too much antireligious bias all finally turned me off after a halfdozen looks at this film sorry but i prefer a kindergentler batman movie after all its just a cartoon most will disagree but i was glad to see the series lighten up after this one
