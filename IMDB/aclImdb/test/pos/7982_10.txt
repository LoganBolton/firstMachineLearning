any batman fan will know just how great the films are theyve been a major success batman returns however is by far the best film in the series a combination of excellent directing brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night inbr br tim burton who directed this movie has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and hes done a great job danny devito penguin man is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby and grown up to become a hideous and uglything michelle pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing catwoman after cats had given her there genes from being bitten the result in both the character changes is excellent and both catwoman and penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film the mysterious catwoman is great fun to watch  her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film danny devito also does well his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he livesbr br you cant forget batman though micheal keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance and shows us a different side to batman his affection is let loose when he confronts catwoman at the end of the film and his meetings with her when shes a normal person selina kyle result in him being seduced badly in his own home theres a clever part after this when they leave and the film is full of great scenes its worth noting that bruce waynes bat mobile is not used as much as in the other batman films as close combat and story telling scenes make up this filmbr br the winter setting is created perfectly in gotham city with most of the scenes being set at night and with the town being filled with snow therefore if you watch this film during the summer like i have it doesnt feel the same best watch it during the winterbr br overall its an amazing movie all the credit goes to tom burton and the cast theyve done an incredible job
