batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor and i like it a lot also the scenery is more darker and the entire environment is saddening along with the soulchilling music composed by the sotalented danny elfmanbr br however i didnt like the idea to make the penguin a monster unlike to the comic books where hes human even if he looks like a monster he shows well that he possesses a human dignity and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents but still he was a dangerous villain in fact and he needed to be stoppedbr br michael keaton made a tour de force with his return as the dark knight and this time hes powerful as in the original batman its not difficult to understand why hes called batman in public sometimesbr br also michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and wellfitted in her role and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villaincrimefighter dressed as a cat really the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns which made it a successful moviebr br if you liked batman watch its awesome sequel cause its very worthy for all the dark knights hardcore loversbr br steve baillargeon
