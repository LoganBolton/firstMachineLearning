tim burton is in essence an expressionist filmmaker disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with gothic scope opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career however with his style being so poignantly endearing i like many moviegoers forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially one hundred million dollar art filmsbr br its almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise especially when that franchises target audience are halfwitted 15 year old boys batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor ensuring box office draw and cheap in actual fact very expensive thrills being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience had this been the result then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment instead burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase out therebr br from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prisonlike bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river it is clear that batman returns aint no picnic at buckingham palace cut to thirty three years later during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon max shreck sinisterly portrayed by christopher walken the red triangle circus gang attack gotham city batman michael keaton returning to the role makes his first appearance sporting a new logo eventually saving the day shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and blackmailed into endorsing the political return of the baby now a fully grown penguin man danny devito in hideously perfect makeup whose motives for return are suspicious only to batmanbr br meanwhile shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant selina kyle played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic catwoman out for revenge and harbours for some unexplained reason a deadly vendetta against the dark knightbr br batman returns is bleak the production design is breathtaking delivering a cold haunting gotham city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor danny elfmans score supports the film brilliantly ranging from invigorating to tragic the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding shot like a sad nightmare burtons direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for burtons visual style of filmmaking and whilst burtons action sequences struggle for exhilaration the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters the penguins demise the catwomans mental state and bruce waynes lonely destinybr br warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed after all they wanted a batman sequel not a weird somewhat ghastly horror movie in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies allthewhile vomiting what can only be described as green mucus the production company wanted an audience friendly feature something for the mcdonalds clan to promote their happy meals with not a movie of dire irredeemable characters including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingersbr br its easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns the film never felt like a batman blockbuster it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations this is why burton failed to create a great batman film he did however create a nostalgic and stunning ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of minebr br this may not be a great batman movie but it is a great tim burton film
