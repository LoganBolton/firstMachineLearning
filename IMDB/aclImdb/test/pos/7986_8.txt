the best batman movie of the 90s no doubt about it this movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmaresbr br although the villains are somewhat cheesy they fit perfect for the movies tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography br br the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations br br dont get fooled by the cheesy outfits this is a movie in the pure style of burton that cant be described burton is a sui generis director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about its comic style past br br recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all if it deals with super heroes
