first off this film has no story its obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production  sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the setbr br that said the film is kinda brilliant pfeiffer is amazing  and i mean amazing as catwoman she nails the characters inherent sexy darkness and goodbad tendencies walken is walken  but even more nasty than usual devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin but he is good and memorable br br keaton is underrated as batman br br and the music and style are pure cinema thrill true the 3rd act doesnt work but the final 2 scenes are knockouts and its clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this films kinky darkness thats too bad because pfieffer and keaton had classic chemistry and had they acted in a third installment joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans
