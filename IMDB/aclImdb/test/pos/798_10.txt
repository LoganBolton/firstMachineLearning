i really like traci lords she may not be the greatest actress in the world but shes rather good in this she play the dowdy conservative reporter to a t its a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while jeff fahey is also good as tracis boss i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress shes certainly no worse than some of todays leading ladies
