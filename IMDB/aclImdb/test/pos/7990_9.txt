as a kid i grew up with the chintzy 60s tv series and no im not that old pow however when director tim burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen i simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hypedlatest additions batman begins and the dark knight which i dont really care for even if theyre going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore bruce waynebatman psyche further but in honesty i dont think theres all that much to tap in to i wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes thats what burton brought across and this is the reason why i can watch them over and over again br br after wowing audiences with the 1989 batman thanks to the gaudily gothic art direction and jack nicholson take noprisoners performance of the campedup but psychotic joker burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far batman returns camp but welldone in what would fair up to being even more expansive louder dreary and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one enter the grotesque penguin with danny devito magnificently going out on a limb and the ravishing catwoman a steamy michelle pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely coming to spoil gothams party again batman an aptly brooding michael keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes plays second fiddle to the bad guys but i always preferred this sober interpretation of batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed and his turn of bruce wayne was well served too burtons illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes the moody narrative in what probably is a tad too long is more so symbolic in its progression rather showpiecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant setpieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and greyblue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop the magnetically freeflowing camerawork takes flight and danny elfmans stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull the rest of the performances might be overshadowed but christopher walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a twofaced businessman max shreck pat hingle is back but gets very little to do as commissioner james gordon and michael gough is delightful as alfred in solid support are michael murphy andrew bryniarski vincent schiavelli doug jones and peter rubens also makes a cameo appearance
