i remember really liking batman returns when it came out in 1992 but now i think that this is the best of all the batman movies even over christopher nolans terrific 2005 batman begins and definitely over the seriously overhyped overrated 2008 the dark knight i originally remember thinking that the 1st batman w jack nicholson was the best and i still love it but i think that this movie really hits the nail on the head the 4 main characters batman penguin catwoman and max shreck are all vivid and memorable you really get to see what batmanbruce wayne is all about in keatons terrific characterization keaton is the best batman not kilmer clooney or even the upandcoming bale who was exceptional in bb and could have stolen top honors from keaton had his character not been destroyed by nolans hack filmmaking in tdk  br br danny devito as the penguin is disturbing scary hilarious and lethal devito is great and doesnt need scenerychewing to give great performance like nicholsons joker the viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society i had never really been big fan of michelle pfeiffer until this film but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers pfeiffers selina kyle is goofy and odd at first then when she is transformed into catwoman she is simultaneously sexy and scary a total deadly sexpot also i feel that keaton and pfeiffer have more chemistry than keaton and basinger from batman they form a tragic love story and christopher walken as shreck is well as always christopher walkenbr br batman returns more so than batman is more confident and focused it is assured filmmaking from beginning to end the way burton introduces the penguins heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning the first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film danny elfmans music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film it is a modification from the original batman and a great onebr br then flash forward 33 years to the present day gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman shreck who wants to build new power plant in gotham during same scene we meet shrecks meek bullied underconfident secretary selina kyle and not long after all this is the films exciting opening action sequence as batman must battle the penguins red triangle gang a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers penguin sets plan in motion to attack the gotham christmas celebration kidnap shreck in the chaos and force him to help reintroduce him to society meanwhile selina discovers shrecks criminal plans and so he kills her by shoving her out his highrise office then she is revived by cats br br sound convoluted yes but burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story he has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen a dark noirish world comprised of mistreated deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in confident storytelling if you ask mebr br the action scenes are few and far in between but they are all exciting entertaining and nailbiting they arent there just for show the way some in batman are and they all make sense the climactic scene with penguins army marching into the center of gotham with batman zoning in on penguins hideout and sidekick butler alfred michael gough in a welcome return from the original assisting batman is succinct solid heartpounding funbr br i also love the christmastime wintry setting which adds to the superdark cold feel of burtons batman world i also love the way burton slowly introduces to us the batman toys without shoving them down our throats each toy is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose and although dark returns is still a funny film devitos penguin has many funny lines so does walkens shreck the batmancatwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humorfilled as well a great ensemble all in all batman returns is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in tim burtons fun comic book world
