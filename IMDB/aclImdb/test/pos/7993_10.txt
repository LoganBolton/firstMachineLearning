ive enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didnt date when i grew up i did notice a few scenes in this film that didnt make any sense like hhmm the crowd is angry hey where did they get those tomatoes from then i thought who cares this movie is not 100 serious anywaybr br the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didnt like all the actors this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast a more gothic style and no involvement of prince br br nowadays many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics i dont think this is entirely true there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60s and a bit with batman  robin a director is free to choose what kind of batman hes going to portray as long if its goodbr br my opinion batman doesnt necessarily have to be serious its about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole ideabr br i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well especially the dark knight theres simply something about this movie that interests me more nolans goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman thats a bit too much for me im a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmospherebr br my conclusion is that you shouldnt compare the nolan with the burton movies theyre just different and its up to you to decide which one you like better my respect is for both directors
