i always thought the batman returns was a great sequel to batman the story was an interesting one and danny devito christopher walken and micheal keaton gave great performances plus lets face it tim burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than joel screwmacher ever didbr br plot oswald cobblepot also know as the penguinplayed by danny devito is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed he uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of gotham with the help of his goonsred triangle gang and a very shady tycoon max shreckplayed by christopher walken max shreck later makes penguin the mayor of gotham selina kylemichelle pfeiffer is pushed out of a window by max shreck and is revived by cats later on she develops catlike qualities and seeks to destroy max shreck and batman her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explainedbr br opinion batman returns is a classic it has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere tim burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing micheal keaton is still sharp as batman danny devito steals the show as oswald cobblepotthe penguin when you think about it he would have made a better violator for the movie spawn than john leguizamo michelle pfeiffer gave catwoman more personality than halle berry ever could max shreck is one of christopher walkens best roles the main reason why i like batman returns is that its fun its not only creative but its also fun something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack the batman series goes to the dogs after tim burton decided to do no more you dont believe me look at batman forever and batman and robin thank god that christopher nolan breathed life back into the series with batman begins
