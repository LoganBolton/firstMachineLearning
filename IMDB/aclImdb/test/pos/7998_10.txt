this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie the story focuses on baman taking on three enemies the penguin wonderfully played by danny devito catwoman the slinky michelle pfeiffer and max shreck the superb christopher walkenbr br perhaps the best entry in the series it has it all complex themes complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious standout is devito as the multilayered penguin here is a guy who is evil pitiable funny and perhaps most importantly scary the infamous scene with shrecks image consultants still sends shivers up my spine in other words the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performancesbr br i do not hesitate to say that batman returns is my favorite of all the batmans released sorry dark knight fans if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action then please check out this badly underrated film br br if nothing else its at least the best film tim burton has ever made
