i really wanted to be able to give this film a 10 ive long thought it was my favorite of the four modern liveaction batman films to date and maybe it still will bei have yet to watch the schumacher films again im also starting to become concerned about whether im somehow subconsciously being contrarian you see i always liked the schumacher films as far as i can remember they were either 9s or 10s to me but the conventional wisdom is that the two tim burton directed films are far superior i had serious problems with the first burton batman this time aroundi ended up giving it a 7and apologize as i might i just couldnt help feel that batman returns just has too many small direction plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10br br but burton almost trumps the problems with sheer force of style and even though there are a lot of small flaws batman returns is still a great film especially if youre a burton fan as batman returns has just as much in common with the nightmare before christmas 1993 and edward scissorhands 1990 as it does with anything else in the batman universebr br the film begins strongly with the cobblepots having a baby we see their dismaypeople walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces ready to vomit later they have the baby in a small cage finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the gotham city river the baby ends up becoming batman villain the penguin danny devitobr br meanwhile max shreck christopher walken is the films evil capitalist comparable to grissom jack palance in batman he is planning on duping gotham city in various ways and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary the timid selina kyle michelle pfeiffer when kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots grissom tries to get rid of her but she is rescued by cats becoming catwomanbr br while all of this is going on the penguin who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy despite having less than benevolent ulterior motivesbr br before rewatching burtons batman films this time i didnt remember just how little the films are about batman michael keaton its almost as if burton didnt feel the character was interesting enough to focus on the focus here is much more on the villains especially the penguin batman doesnt appear very often especially in the beginning of the film and surprisingly often were watching him watching the penguinbr br although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw i cant say that i do even if id like to know more about batman and follow his story more the villains stories are interesting too and as an origin story for two major batman villains batman returns is already more than complex in terms of plotbr br however there are some character problems that i do count as a flaw the penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding but even though theyre frequently on screen we never get to learn anything about them burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in tod brownings freaks 1932 available with actors as interesting as vincent schiavelli but he just doesnt have the space to use thembr br for that matter he hardly has space to explore catwoman the film plays as if catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long so the bulk of the catwoman scenes had to be excised of course all of this barely leaves any room for batman burton has batman turn very dark in the publics eye in this film and unusually he never bothers to resolve this as far as we know at the end gothamites still think that batman is a murdering lunatic thats an interesting development but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the nextbr br as for the script although there are minor problems including some nonsequiturs and bizarre decisions in terms of logic made by characters its clear that burton and writers sam hamm and daniel waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story a lot of the dialogue is punoriented but often this is fairly subtle andor complex of course sometimes it is very blatant or transparent too it helps to look at batman returns as a more poetic film as i believe was the intention this also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisionsplenty of odd character actions including from minor characters are done in service of a general mood or style and that style works very wellbr br dark is the easiest way to sum up batman returns in a word and whether thats a positive or negative depends on your disposition anyone who knows me knows that i love dark so for me burtons style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script in many ways batman returns is like an insane campy horror film with beautifully eerie production design like batman burton is still making many references to other films but instead of vertigo 1958 and star wars 1977 well theres still a slight star wars reference he invokes films like nosferatu 1922 including that max schreck was the name of the actor who played the draculalike character there motel hell 1980 the aforementioned freaks willy wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 which has a surreal dark edge to it and zombie filmsmade most explicit in the penguins final scenebr br in terms of visuals and general atmosphereand that includes the general feel of the story the characters and so onthis couldnt be a stronger 10
