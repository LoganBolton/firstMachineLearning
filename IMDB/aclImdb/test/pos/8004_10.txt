i dont know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre i really dont dark yes bizarre  no it i s sad and with lots of emotions specially with the pinguins story they say it has elements of sm but i really dont find anything of that sort except for catwomans whipbr br this movie is deeper than its genre and villains arent just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade they have strong motives with strong feelings involved catwoman a great performance by michelle pfeifer isnt just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels  shes on her personal crusade and pinguin well by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him strong performance by danny devito again i think michael keaton is the best batman and he carries his costume wellbr br you can totally see that it is a tim burton movie because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy but also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions
