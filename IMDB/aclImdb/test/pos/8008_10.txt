out of all the batfilms batman returns is my favorite this beautiful dark and funny film is one of tim burtons best work although it is much violent and darker this is the batman that creator bob kane envisioned many years ago michael keaton reprises his role as the avenger of gotham city this time hes up against two deadly foes danny devitos penguin and michelle pfeiffers catwoman with a great cast and film score by danny elfman the movie takes us on an adventure as batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over gotham city christopher walken makes a great appearance as max shrek a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve but of course michelle pfeiffer is the one that steals the show with all of these components you have a film that will blow you away this is the reason why you go to the movies its got everything its really a shame that tim burton didnt get to direct the other sequels if so i think the franchise would still be going strong today batman returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies
