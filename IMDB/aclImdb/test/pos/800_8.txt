good filmbr br i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale Â£299 seems like a good deal and it is thing is the film is named to kill for it took a little detective work to find out its original namebr br in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ability to sell having seen final destination 3 last night it in my view should have been a 18br br maybe the fact the delightful traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18 such a shamebr br traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions she ability to turn what is branded a bmovies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazingbr br long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress
