step by step is my opinion is a pure abc hit i cant recall every episode but i still enjoyed it its hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school i always laugh at that as a matter of fact i think just about every single one of jt brandon call and codys sasha mitchell lines were funny it would have been nice if penny patrika darbo had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion i hope it never stops airing in syndication
