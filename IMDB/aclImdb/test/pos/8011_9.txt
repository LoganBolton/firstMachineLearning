i watched this show until my puberty but still i found it to reflex many situations that worry us when were teenagers although it was a family oriented show until the mid 90s it focused more on the young adults and their situationsbr br thats why i loved step by step i mean it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of its kind it delivered expectationsbr br lets be honest this wasnt an extremely funny show no but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnierbr br there was an extremely good charm between patrick duffy and susan sommers duffy rocked sommers was tender and actually funny i was in love with stacy keegan because she was extremely sexy loved her legs and witty but sasha mitchell stole the show with his cody character he was the man back in the day oh the memories nowadays this show wasnt been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and thats why it should be kept in the vault of memories thats it only memoriesbr br thank you step by step for making my puberty funnier
