after watching this film i experienced a new sensation i had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost rivaled the legend chevy chase in fletch this isnt to say that the performances are comparable but both give practically flawless delivery of their lines that actor is marc singer singer is jack ford the droid gunner of the title grinding out a living collecting the bounty on androidsthere are some mutants topless pleasure droids a scandinavian smuggler and possibly a halfhearted attempt to make a statement on class or maybe even globalization or well it doesnt really matter what matters about this film is the dry manner in which singer delivers his lines resulting in sidesplitting humour what matters about this film is that director fred olen ray seems to realize that serious scifi very rarely works and when your budget is skimpy it is best not to take yourself to seriously olen ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this transfers onto the filmi dare you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic earth as eternally dark and neonlit and then ends in a pipes and valves warehouse self parody is a very redeeming quality to summarise fred olen ray is an ambassador for independent film making and marc singer the perfect bmovie leadif only olen ray could draft in tim thomerson to the equation then wed have a film on our hands
