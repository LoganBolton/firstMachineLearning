i must say i didnt expect much about this movie but it turned out not to be bad at all most striking of course was aidan quinns performance i would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero the great thing about it is that he really builds up his character annibal i mean it was not like mel gibson or bruce willis would do it he was sensitive and modest for example hes really upset when he kills someone i also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided when annibal gets his training you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average american would do in such a situation ask what the f is going on and refusing to cooperate but annibal is a professional marine officer he doesnt give up and he tries not to lose his courage in which he succeeds pretty well except for a brief breakdown on christmas eve which i think was very realistic im glad that aidan quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him in fact two because he plays the villain as well even although the film wasnt that successful
