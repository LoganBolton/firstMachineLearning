picture the scene a bored student with an empty day ahead a video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals this exstudent usually just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary of reasons the turning anybody occasionally the odd undiscovered gem did make it into his vcr  this being the case with this film everything about the film is good but much more than this the parts all mesh to provide something all too rare  a cracking good film why this never got a uk cinema release is beyond me especially when we consider the crap that we have to wade through at the multiplex week on week whilst ill happily accept this isnt oscar material but neither was sodding titanic  schmaltzy cgitinged bollocks it is a an extremely enjoyable film i was trying to think of a way to describe how best this film should be appreciatedaccepted  the perfect film to watch while bonding with your dad after a coming home for the holidays after a large sunday lunch
