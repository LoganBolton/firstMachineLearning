this movie is about carlos the jackal quinn an international terrorist who by cia agent henry fieldss sutherland description appears to maim women and children for the heck of it at least thats what he says to guilt us naval officer annibal ramirez quinn again into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaosbr br the movie isnt all shootgunjumparound action and thats a good thing in its first half ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos and thats actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other runofthemill action flicks an israeli agent kingsley joins fields in training ramirez and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ramirezs new character ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes to act on the split second like carlos would and even to make love like carlos courtesy of an exgirlfriend of carloss naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie its a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carloswannabebr br another thing i liked about this movie was that it didnt utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies  you know the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twins family ramirezs family does come into the picture but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family lifebr br good chuckle humor is injected into this movie often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ramirezs first name annibal annabelle get it also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is in my opinion during the final showdown the payoff wasnt able to match the buildupbr br on the whole the movie was enjoyable im not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughoutbr br my rating 910
