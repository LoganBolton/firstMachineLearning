the movie was very good im an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didnt figure out who did it i wasnt happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that cloying please know that while these poirot movies are good they just dont have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they dont have japp ms lemon and especially hastings david suchet is definitely poirot i have seen every actor whos played him the worst was peter ustinov
