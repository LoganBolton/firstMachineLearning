2002s the bourne identity is one of my alltime favorite movies however many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the books plotbr br the assignment is the real deal its odd that noone on the bourne identity threads has mentioned this movie at all well i jst didbr br besides the excellent plot i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie ive ever seen with the possible exception of the bournebr br identity itselfbr br the action is all completely realistic i especially liked the protagonists training regimen which was very inventivebr br the feel is dark and gritty there are a few surprising plot twists the acting is excellent br br if you like this genre i cannot recommend this movie highly enough
