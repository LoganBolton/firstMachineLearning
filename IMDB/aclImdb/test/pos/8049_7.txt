its hard to imagine that the battle of elderbush gulch directed by the legendary dw griffith was made a way back in 1914 it is a showcase for griffiths emerging stylebr br  the story centers around a group of settlers called the cameron brothers and their families which include a young waif mae marsh sent out from the east to live with her uncles and a young wife lillian gish who has just given birth a group of indians tries to capture the waifs pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk during the confrontation the indian chiefs son henry b wathall is killed the indian chief plots his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of elderbush gulchbr br  it is this attack which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other time that forms the core of the picture the indians slaughter the towns folk women and children alike and drive them out of town towards the camerons homestead the newborn baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the calvarybr br  the battle scenes contain some graphic violence for example we see a woman being scalped alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot down i have never seen an animal being slain so convincingly on screen mrgriffith was becoming a master of staging large scale battle scenes a talent that he would use extensively in his epic civil war drama the birth of a nation released the following yearbr br  even though it runs a scant 29 minutes the battle of elderbush gulch is nonetheless an exciting and historic bit of film making see if you can spot lionel barrymore and harry carey in bit parts
