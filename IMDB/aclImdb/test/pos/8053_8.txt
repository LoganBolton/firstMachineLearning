born in 1946 i was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impressionnot only scary for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 yearsthe mob goon played by john larch was terrifyingthe only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a little n kidthose words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on tvmaybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking sceneaccurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the south and still till today the closest ive come to visiting a southern city is el pasothat stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the storywhen the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for yearswith the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is factthe film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibilitythe terror in the movie isnt provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the timere killing of little girlthe recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mindwhen this movie came out the only school i had ever gone to was attended by mostly africanamericansthe victim looked like a girl in my classit was like seeing an actual killingit made a horrible scene that much worsemaybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me
