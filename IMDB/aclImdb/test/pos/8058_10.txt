during the clete roberts preface i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production however what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast culled from hollywoods poverty row and this makes the movie all the more realistic there are no punches pulled here and at times the film is reminiscent of the well1951 the black and white texture gives a newsreellike quality for certain younger viewers will be reminded of the blair witch project but this one is based on real events
