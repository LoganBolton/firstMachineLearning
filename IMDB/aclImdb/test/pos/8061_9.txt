ive read anne frank the diary of a young girl when i was in high school and found myself completely engrossed in her story and also in the broadway play of her life in the secret annexebr br however im a little perplexed about how people have perceived her diary and of her as a person seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world i dont think that was the original intention of her diary she wrote it mainly for herself even though she did make some rigorous rewrites before the occupants of the secret annexe were betrayed intending it to be published somedaybr br but i never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hopebut as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a diary no doubt she was a very engaging writer and she did possess an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words you really got to know her well through her diary but the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of the proof that the holocaust did happenbr br it also brought the tragedy of the holocaust closer to home to lose someone that we could put a familiar face and personality to at such a young ageliterally having had her young life ripped away from her and from the other occupants who were murdered in the holocaust its a searing indictment of the nazis systematic murder of over 6 million jews and that should not be forgottenbr br but its sad to me that her diary is being so misconstrued as anything more than that when i look for hope i have the biblethe first most widely read nonfiction book in the world gods words in the bible is eternalbut annes diary is a diary of a young girl under extraordinary circumstances and that is it she is not someone to be worshiped or idolized because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws who possessed incredible talent as a writer and who died at age 15 from typhus in the bergenbelsen concentration camp she was a victim of the holocaust and as this otherwise excellent documentary has so vividly testified she was hitlers most famous victimbr br besides the anne franks storythe stories from her family members and friends and survivors of the holocaust were engrossing vivid and powerful i especially enjoyed miep gies testimony and marvel that she is still strong and alive today hannah goslars testimony was also very interesting and i also liked hearing from otto frank but i also agree that the moving picture of the young girl with the dark hair and the familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable br br another thing about the holocaust that i kind of disagree with the documentaryis that i dont believe it was just a matter of discriminationbut rather something deeper and more profound and that was just an act of pure evil pure evil nothing else but pure evilbr br excellent documentary of anne frank and of the holocaust that should be watched
