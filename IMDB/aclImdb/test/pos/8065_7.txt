although the concept of a 32 year old woman portraying a 12 year old girl might be a stretch for todays br br sophisticated audiencesin the 1920s this was what the fans of mary pickford desired and expected from their favorite star the opening scene displays annies tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multiethnic street gang in comic battle with a rival group the sight of a young girl being socked in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude but the scene is played in such an our gang fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously anyway annie can dish it out as well as take it once annie returns to her tenement home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire it becomes more difficult especially in closeups to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street urchin however for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief the rest of the movie has its rewards vacillating between comedy annies gang puts on a show to sentiment annie plans a birthday surprise for her irish policeman father to tragedy her father is killed on his birthday the film gives mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era br br of course the requisite happy ending is eventually achieved the evildoers are apprehended with the help of annies friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day which is a good a way as any for a mary pickford movie to end br br
