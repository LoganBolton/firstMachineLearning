mary pickford plays annie rooneythe daughter of a cop that lives in the tough part of town she is a rough and tumble young lady of indeterminate age somewhere between 12 and 16 who loves to scrap but down deep has a heart of goldbr br this is a very typical style of film for mary pickford like so many of her films she plays a young girleven though she was nearly 40 when she made little annie rooney and like so many other stories she was both plucky and courageous as a result i had a strong feeling of déjà vu now if you havent seen her other films this isnt an issue however she is essentially playing a character much like the one in sparrows or daddy long legsthough these two other films are a lot better now this isnt to say this is a bad filmjust that its certainly not among her best workmostly due to a rather schmaltzy story that is very heavy on sentiment but not especially convincing entertaining but not essential viewing unless you are a huge fan of the silents
