the summary line is some mens wet dream for the ideal woman  o seriously though back to the movie which has classic cinema written all over it pun intended and quite literally shown in the picture too as youll see br br how could someone make a silent movie in this year and age its not completely silent for once take the music for instance with great cinematography is the answer and its no wonder that it did win prizes as another user stated in this area but its also sometimes its downfall although the pictures are great it sometimes delves too much in them instead of moving forward plot and time wise if you can cope with that than youll enjoy it even more than me i havent told you anything about the story but ill never do that because i dont want to spoiler anything for you
