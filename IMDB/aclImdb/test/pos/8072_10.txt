i didnt see such a movie where the creators put so much hearts blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long timebr br everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality camerawork editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing the titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographedbr br this movie just blew me awaybr br the showdown could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes thoughbr br its a near to perfect homage to early silent noir films story acting scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent filmmaking
