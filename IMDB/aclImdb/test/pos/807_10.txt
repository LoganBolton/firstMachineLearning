excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda claire price as well of course as david suchet i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point the ending which i wont divulge someone describes it on the board in answer to someone elses question if you are interested i found really sad despite agatha christies reputation for writing cardboard characters i thought these really wellrounded by and largebr br the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke cedrics son i believe in addition to being a wellknown dr watson as her husband
