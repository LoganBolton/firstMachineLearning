the vicious circle is a very unknown british mystery story like many hitchcock movies its about a man who is being accused of a crime he didnt commit and does everything he can to prove it this time its a dr latimer john mills who finds a murdered german actress from his floor as an honest man the doctor calls scotland yard which turns out to be a big mistakebr br theres really nothing special in this little movie still watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time i enjoyed following the plot development fine actors are a plus
