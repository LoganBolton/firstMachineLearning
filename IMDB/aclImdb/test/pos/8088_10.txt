this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is it is a movie both for children and parents and it is timeless i saw this movie before oceans eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance but the play of klatretøsen is much more downtoearth and moving why i say oceans eleven is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and klatretøsen is that good  that it can bear comparison with oe the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe compared to what we are used to in denmark the different cases of impossible acts is handled in a way that you wouldnt belive from many young actors and sometimes not even from the old boys the story  again it has things in common with oceans eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom the part in which the young people has to take care of idas younger brother gives a fine element in the movie try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy on your arm br br this movie can bear comparison with most grown up movie like mi2 and oceans eleven yes i do believe it is that good it is best to see it in a theater as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever br br regards klavs
