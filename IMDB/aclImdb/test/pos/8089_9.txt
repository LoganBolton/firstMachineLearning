this satire is just really really deadon and nobody is spared but even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of hitler here cleverly renamed as hynkel and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudogerman the general tone is pretty sad maybe because of the movies place in history and the actors arent even exaggerating that much i suppose one of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the jewish barbers ending speech if only things could have ended in that way its not even really the character talking anymore its chaplin saying something he really wanted to say if you ignore the technical aspects the movie doesnt feel dated or old it actually moves at a pretty nice pace and the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die the only thing i dont care for is the slapstick but that just comes with the era i suppose this is an incredibly daring harsh take on fascism its so hardhitting still after all these years
