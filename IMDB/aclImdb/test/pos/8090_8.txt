this was charlie chaplins first alltalking film yes there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film modern times but it was still essentially a silent film so it wasnt until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on filmbr br the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation while i enjoyed the film i was not nearly as impressed by this as chaplins other fulllength films of the mid20s and 30s thats because i really felt annoyed by some of chaplins dopey overacting when he played adenoid hynkelespecially when he was giving his speeches the silly pseudodialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used such as the three stooges plus playing a funny hitler is hard for me to takebr br however when chaplin played the jewish barber he wasnt especially funny he really wasnt intended to be a funny character but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency this film should not be remembered as a comedy especially since it doesnt really excel there but for its excellent acting and humanity the final speech by the barber impersonating hynkel is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes watch the film for this reason alone
