this was chaplins first alltalking picture and the results are mixed the movie is a biting satire of hitler and mussolini their henchmen and their fanatical way of life especially regarding the persecution of the jews it was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirmbr br when compared to chaplins earlier works this is quite pale in comparison the sweet funny style of his silents in my opinion is far superior to his first talkie there are lots of meaningless bits that drag on if this was a silent it probably would not have happenedbr br i find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance one of the most touching moments is obviously the speech at the endbr br the great dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both chaplins history and movie history it is flawed but chaplin is in great form
