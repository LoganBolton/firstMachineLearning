most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism made at the height of those movements successbr br sadly in the final moments of the film chaplin abandons all pretense of making art not to mention comedy and switches completely to propaganda and not antinazi propaganda either but some of the most mawkish and idiotic progressive propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywoodbr br never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give delivered ironically with a disturbing wildeyed fanaticism such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message
