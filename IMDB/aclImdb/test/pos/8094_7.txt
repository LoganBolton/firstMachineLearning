written produced and directed by charlie chaplin this is the great actors antinazi propaganda piece skewering adolf hitlerbr br chaplin plays adenoid hynckel the dictator of tomania as well as a jewish barber who is hynckels spitting image his parody of hitler is brilliant anyone who has ever seen newsreels of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature br br i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slapstick focussing on the first world war adventures of the jewish barber having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about but the movie picks up steam quickly there are some very funny moments and enough emphasis on the antijewish nature of hynckelism to make the propaganda point the climax of the film is a brilliant antinazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the moviebr br as good as chaplin is in this movie though i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack oakie playing the dictator of bacteria  benzino napaloni our first look at oakie shows how well he had studied his subject  he had mussolinis arrogant posturing down pat the scenes in which hynckel and napaloni negotiate over the fate of osterlich had me in stitchesbr br this was a very good movie and well worth watching
