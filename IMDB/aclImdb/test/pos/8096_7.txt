a good but not great film the great dictator is chaplins first talkie its a good effort and at times a remarkable satire on hitler but unfortunately the moments of chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue yes chaplin the silent screen master just uses too many words in this film and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films such as better limelight still chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable paulette goddard doesnt have the glow she did in modern times her offscreen affair with chaplin was cooling at the time but she is always worth seeing and jack oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to chaplins famous creation hynkel
