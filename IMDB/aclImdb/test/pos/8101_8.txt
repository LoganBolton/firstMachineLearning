from the beginning of the film i found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so i did not wake anyone in the house this didnt continue so much throughout the rest of the film i didnt find everything completely laugh out loud funny but still i found certain things quite funny at the beginning i had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking hand grenade down his sleeve then there are scenes where you will just smile like when the barber falls through a roof into someones apartment i can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didnt feel original though at the time im sure it was i loved hynkels hitlers bursts of raging german with the nice subtle english translationbr br the final scene is wildly discussed because well its absolutely true and so very intelligently constructed though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today if this doesnt show how great a writer chaplin is then i dont know what will the acting in this scene in particular was quite good the barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film at the same time enjoying the humorous sidebr br another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film that almost feels ahead of its time of course chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940 he was not aware of the holocaust obviously hes also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film the fact this film is so antihitler is interesting its more interesting that it wasnt antigermany which would be very easy to have done back in those times chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film but instead did something more he made an honest filmbr br i recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it as well those who has studied or is studying hitler and wwii to watch this film its entertaining to say the least it doesnt have an annoying outdated feel that some films of the time did unlike most comedies this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you watch this film you will be better off for having seen it
