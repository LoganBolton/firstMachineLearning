the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot it s set on a country house on a weekend as always all the guests are suspects and its up to poirot to figure out the truth with movies like this its always best not to give too much away so ill stop here what i loved in the hollow was that its a mystery the old fashioned way when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example everybody seems to be the culprit theres that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the storybr br you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experiencebr br the actors are all very good as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr watson in sherlock holmes nice to see him after a few years suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the timebr br i did find out who the murderer was but still its not predictable and its also very believablebr br so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasurebr br
