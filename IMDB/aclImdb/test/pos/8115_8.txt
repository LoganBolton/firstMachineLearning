i loved this movie it was adorably touching and funny finally heres a story about a group of people who meet some challenges flounder a bit and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for when was the last time you saw that in a film dealing with the fluidity of life love and sexuality the characters are faced with real problems albeit in often ridiculous situations like the mens group camping trip and the explicit realatory liaisons and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy darkly desperate or too unrealistic youll love and care about the characters who far from being hollow stereotypes portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their wouldbe labelsbr br a good romcom for a saturday afternoon and the only movie ive ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily and no one is forced to be anything they dont want to be far better than kissing jessica stein a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson or maybe you just like a good british romp james purefoy looks dashing as always and tom hollander is deliciously funny so go forth watch enjoy you wont regret it
