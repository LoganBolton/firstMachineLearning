i saw this film at the boston internation festival of womens cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her qa after the screening that she doesnt expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the socalled gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so its really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troches direction make this one of the funniest films ive seen
