an inspired choice of director for this latest britflick rose troche who burst on the scene with the budgetfree tale of ny dykes go fish brings a gently jaundiced view to this tale of a londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive huntergatherers but end up ordering a takeaway the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and troche whod never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with go fishs grainy hyperkinesis a really enjoyable film
