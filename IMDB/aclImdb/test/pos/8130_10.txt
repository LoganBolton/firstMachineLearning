the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of us distribution i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of womens cinema and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it terrific performances and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose troche all combine to make this film a winner
