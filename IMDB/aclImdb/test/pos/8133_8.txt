ok i dont kid myself that this is the typical gay love life but since when are straight romances in real life as they are on the screen this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander and having seen him in priscilla queen of the desert only the day before he is probably one of the most secureintheirmasculinity actors around  anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot thumbs up 810
