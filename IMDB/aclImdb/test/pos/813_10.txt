this has to be one of the funniest movies ive ever seen the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness when mom and dad both lose there jobs not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub they decide its in their families best interest to move to oregon once there everything goes wrong an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie including a young molly ringwaldthis a movie i would definetly recommend
