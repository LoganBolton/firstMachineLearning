i loved this film it was so easy to become a part of the characters lives and really feel the emotion they were going throughbr br a film filled with laughs sarcasm shocks and upset just a fantastic romantic drama reallybr br the only part i didnt enjoy was in the special features the behind the scenes commentary was a little off putting because id seen the film before the extras i prefer thinking of the actors like the characters silly i know but the actors personalitys are very different from the characters they play but nevertheless its a totally fantastic spectacular brilliant film i recommend that anyone who looked at this film and thought hmmmmmmm should i buy it answer must be a definite yes
