when i was told about this movie i wasnt too happy to see it although by the end credits turned out to be one of the best movies i have ever viewedbr br the movie it self is quite graphic male to male scenes you dont see everything wouldnt be a gay themed movie if there wasntbr br the movie is very light hearted with humor and contains some very funny parts i highly recommend this movie about 3 quarters through you really feel for the main characters and this i think brings the whole flick togetherbr br once again very nicely put together plus cute mormon
