with the exception of the main character the acting didnt convince me but the story was quite good its about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary as you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic the movie is very american and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers Â…you mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my alltime favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance i think this is an important message in our times since i rated films that i liked less with 9 this is clearly a 10 for me some people may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
