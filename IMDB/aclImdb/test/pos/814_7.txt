the story is about a working girl ann sothern who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend paul kelly this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says hes too busy to take her out to celebrate so not wanting to just stay home she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man neil hamilton sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a love em and leave em sort of guy how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predictjust suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectlybr br this is a very modest little film from columbia pictureswith a relatively small budget as well as secondtier stars its clearly a bmovie despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwellas both had yet to become famous now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isnt any good in fact given the production values this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline thats because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them the ending in particular is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing because of these factors the film earns a 7 of 10
