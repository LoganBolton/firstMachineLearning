i love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending this movie could be considered a drama bout two characters realizing true love but the storys so touching and so sweet that in my mind its a romance granted the acting is not so great thats y i didnt give it a 10 but they do the job and they dont overact thank god plus theyre cute but the storys powerful and just plain adorable some of u pansies will choke up its a great watch for a love story but if ur homophobic stay away for everyone else i loved the movie its soo sweet i felt its a brokeback on a smaller scalebut with a happy endingso enjoy
