for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast the acting is uneven but the plot is compelling we could have used a bit more development of wes ramseys character but hey the guys fun to look at nonetheless mary kay place and jacqueline bisset are like icing on the cakebr br its not surprising that it was controversial on its release it presents a less than flattering portrayal of the morman church and its relationship with gays while like brokeback mountain its about tolerance and accepting ones own life i found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message it was more moving too
