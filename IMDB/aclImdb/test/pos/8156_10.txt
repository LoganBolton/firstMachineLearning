this is an allaround superb film a moving experience filled with real life emotion theres lessons to be learned here about love sex work religion and american culture regardless of ones sexual preferencebr br while this film is also a scathing indictment of the mormons church of latter day saints belief system any conservative faith could easily take its place but its a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the mormons in no uncertain terms heres a faith that mandated for generations that believers practice polygamy and these true believers only gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government in order for utah to join the union talk about a unique form of hypocrisy br br the sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly brief theres nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mindbr br what this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural to people who are gay as heterosexuality is to people who are straight while love and sex are obviously quite different needs its absolutely beautiful beyond words when both occur at the same time between two adults profound erotic love is one of lifes most precious gifts my congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done
