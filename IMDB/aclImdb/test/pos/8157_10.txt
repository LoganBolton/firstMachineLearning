excellent performance by mary kay place steve sandvoss jacqueline bissett and rebekah johnson superb story that reels you into the movie emotional yet lighthearted i own this movie and everyone that ive shared it with loves it great for mixed company 18 crowdbr br nice production not a cheap budget well organized and keeps your interest uses dome newer ideas for flashbacks and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seatbr br no matter what walk of life a viewer is from they will buyin to one or more viewpoints in this filmbr br would love to see a sequel
