latter days is a very very independent movie and compared to many of todays more modern films its lacking on many parts the shooting seems at times quite amateurish the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not impressively complex so dont have too high hopes for this movie because as ive said its very independent but whatever it lacks in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the storys charm i cannot claim that the plot is outstandingly original but the story is still beautiful and heartwarming in many ways its not about being gay versus being straight its about faith and how you decide to run your own life its a silly story that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time so to be honest latter days is far from perfect but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it its very critical towards the religious aspects of our society and there is homosexuality involved  but approach it with an open mind and im pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself
