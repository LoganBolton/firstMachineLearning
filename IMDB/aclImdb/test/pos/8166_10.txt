first of all id like to say im just an amateur in commenting movies and that english is not my native language but that i felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie possibly as a way to thank and congratulate c jay cox the cast and the crew for such a brilliant productionbr br yesterday i watched latter days for the first timebr br at first i thought it might be similar to the movie priest which i liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet but priest maybe due to its restrict catholic ideological notions didnt supply my spectators needs by revealing a profound sad endbr br latter days on the other hand broke that concept and some other ones as well such as the mormons principles presenting a tender and cheerful story leading it to a happy and emotive end and yet arousing a feeling of gods blessing and hope a great movie indeedbr br somehow latter days made me feel la as a city of angels br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes astoundingly beautiful gay love stories
