having grown up a mormon and grappled with the churchs bigotry towards blacks they were not allowed to hold the churchs priesthood when i was a member  i wasnt aware of the organizations policy of excommunicating gay men and women until after i left the church in 1966  i was 20 i was stunned when i learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions latter days exposes the mormons persecution of gay members the film is long overdue it does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals latter days has great heart wonderful original music and an added touch of class from jacqueline bisset the film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and reclaims his very soul
