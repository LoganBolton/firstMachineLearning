i have found this epic to be of an astonishing striking even heartbreaking beauty some kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism the choreography herein is hugely enjoyable the actors are thoroughly enjoyable i have been a big fan of crouching tiger  as well but this one was even better they have kitanos ingenuity in delighting in what is pleasurable this beauty affirming adventure cinema is an act of courage when was the suspense so exquisite and genuine and the art of showing huge crowds gigantic armies  the film has something deeply satisfying and a steadfast good taste there is an enormous pleasure in making such a deliberately impressing and clean show its good beyond words few few adventure films let alone epics gave me such an uninterrupted delightbr br fan can be monumental is not monumental artbut is monumental funlike leones movies like some 60s epics also like the hobbits trilogy it is largesized fun
