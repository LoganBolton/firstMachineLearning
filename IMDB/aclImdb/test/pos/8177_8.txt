this movie is excellent  i watched the french version  there are many subplots which usually detracts from the whole  but they nicely unfold and concur to the discovering of ones real self main theme in fact the whole movie besides his background  is the journey to the discovery of ones  or someone elses  self is the king really a good peacenik monarch trying to wage a war to end all wars or is he just a disturbed blood thirsty hoodlum is he a true king after all is the attendant to the queen mother just a lusty careerdriven spineless sock puppet or rather a sharp thinking bold individual will the dameconcubine realize who the king truly is whats between the king and the old chancellor whats the secret everyone knows but wont tell whats the true reason the assassin quit his job subplots something im not particularly fond of  are handled well and keep one watching until the end scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in without going overboard suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task there is a lot of braindamaged smiling but that is how one was supposed to behave at the kings court  as the dameconcubine complains about  realistic movie without superhero moments this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard colossals  gladiator etc  to shame
