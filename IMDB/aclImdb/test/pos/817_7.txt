i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo drafthouse in austin he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was hilarious i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences and the subject is not funny at all but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought id pee they dont come until after the halfway point but when they do oh godyou will die oh and jim brown is brilliant hes not in a lot of the movie but when hes there you know whose movie it is naturally the best line in the movie and the funniest is his youll know it when you hear it
