another period piece for chen kiage cant remember him doing a modern filmbr br good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises none of the hk fighting scenes or the hollywood type of heroes but it is good because of it the characters are strong i really felt for thembr br understanding the mandarin definitely gives the english subtitles the edge the film is 3 hours but it didnt feel like it
