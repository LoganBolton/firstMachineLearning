quite a production from the director telling the story of the qin emperors ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms of china some great characters sets costumes and scenes however i was not blown away by the film in terms of the actors ability which was good i enjoyed the marquis the most or its look although the massing of troops was extremely impressive if it was real man that is a lot of extrasbr br i have seen li gong in other movies and she is always great good period piece i think but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it good film and found the 2 12  hours not a problembr br rating 7 out of 10
