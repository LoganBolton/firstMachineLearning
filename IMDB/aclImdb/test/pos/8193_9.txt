the emperor and the assassin wenglish subtitles at 161 minutes is long but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of chinas unifying king circa 300 bce an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast king qins simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled but not without treachery plots and counter plots and oh yes bodies lots of bodies this epic story of chinas beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history emperor qins legacies include the thousands of lifesize terracotta figures which are still being excavated today as an historical person this film makes it clear that emperor qin should be regarded along with george washington napoleon bonaparte alexander the great genghis khan and julius caesar to name a few of the worlds greatest conquerorsstatesmen i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin especially on the big screen
