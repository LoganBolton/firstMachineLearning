this is an excellent film no its not mel gibson in braveheart but then its not trying to be actually the emperor and the assassin probably has thankfully more in common with a shakespearean production than a hollywood blockbusterbr br in the third century bc the king of qin is attempting to unite in other words conquer the seven kingdoms of china he has already overthrown the kingdom of han now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of yanbr br this is where the lady zhao comes in she and the king have been friends since childhood they are obviously very much in love but cannot marry for political reasons together they devise a plot she will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the king and escape to yan once there she will convince the prince of yan to send an assassin back to kill the king when the assassination fails the king will have his excuse to invade yanbr br once in yan however lady zhao begins to reconsider hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friends ruthlessness she begins to wonder if the king may need to be assassinated for realbr br one sure sign that youre not watching a hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the assassin unlike a hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined this is a fight that could truly go either waybr br this is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in chinese history there is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness most beautiful of all however is gong li as the lady zhao i grow more and more convinced every time i see her that gong li is the most beautiful woman in the worldbr br i must say however that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film early on gong li asks one of her servants do i have a beautiful facebr br duh
