this threehour chinese epic set in 220 bc may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an emperors idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation and theres nothing inherently challenging about the film but its a compelling narrative crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake its an astonishing feast for the eyes the scene depicting the coup attempt of the marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy the title sums up the films use of compelling contrasts  huge plainland vistas set against intimate horrors the noblest of motives set against the most degraded hope turning to dust if youve never seen a threehour chinese epic this wouldnt be a bad place to start
