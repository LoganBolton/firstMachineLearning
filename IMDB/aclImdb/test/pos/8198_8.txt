this is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of china in the third century bc what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him it reminded me a bit of king lear and some of the other shakespeare playsbr br the king starts out with noble ambitions to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives he and his childhood sweetheart played beautifully by li gong concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king thus giving him a pretext to go to war but while shes away the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spreebr br there are numerous side plots that keep the action going there is the marquis who pretends to be stupid and foppish but whos really very clever and wants to become king himself he fathers two children with the kings mother and manages to keep it secret for years then there is the prime minister a political rival to the king who turns out to really be his father br br the assassin is a complex character himself an adept swordsman and killer he is undergoing a reformation when the kings lover comes to recruit him he wants nothing more with killing but is eventually won over by li gong who wouldnt be when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has becomebr br some spectacular cinematography especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale  like they used to say a cast of thousands literally the acting is ok nothing special its the story thats interesting though at over two and a half hours it pushes the limitbr br definitely worth viewing
