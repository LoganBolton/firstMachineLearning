crack house 1989 was one of the few film during the 80s that falls into this genre whats supposed to be an antidrug film turns out to be nothing more than some whiteexploitation exercise in depravity theres nothing wrong with that however the video presentation even has an antidrug message from one of the stars of the show richard turncoat roundtreebr br the movie follows two young lovers in high school one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl one of them gets turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his exfriends jim brown appears as the movies mister big hes one bad dude who still can punkout anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as wellbr br if you like hard edge sleaze then this movies for you sadly hollywood doesnt make these any more and when they do its neither exploitative nor entertainingbr br recommended for sleaze fans
