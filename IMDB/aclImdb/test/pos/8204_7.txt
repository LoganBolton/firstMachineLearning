you could get into the nitty gritty of this film and say how it couldnt happen or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bitsor you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting personally i prefer the latter i live real life and watch the news with all its doom and gloom and so would much rather be entertained by my movies and see the bad guys get their just rewards dont take it too seriously and you can thoroughly enjoy this film
