why all the negative reviews you didnt expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you what we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me not an oscar contender just entertainment you can really see how the movie has aged especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays i still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new crazy and scary thoughts when i saw this for the first time i was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you but whos to say it cant happen im not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death analyzing it until im blue in the face thats not my style average acting suspensful and once again very entertaining sandra bullock as angela bennett is so cute this is my favorite movie with her in it because shes like the computer genius which i find very attractive of all the movies that were released in 1995 this would have to be my favorite although i didnt see it until 1996 my rating 910 because it did slow down a little
