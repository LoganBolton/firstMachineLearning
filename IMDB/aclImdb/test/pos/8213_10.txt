at last sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman but ive finally found a film that she gets to be an actress forget the predictable keanufodder of speed forget the predictable kleenexfodder of while you were sleeping  this tests herbr br and she is great a technofeminist role that really works well on screen on a subject that is very close to the bone the issues raised dont seem farfetched at all and the whole experience helped along by a fine supporting cast makes for quite an unnerving couple of hoursbr br you may never enter another chatroom again in fact im getting quite nervous just writing this reviewerbye
