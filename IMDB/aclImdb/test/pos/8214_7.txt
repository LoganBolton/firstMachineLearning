this is one of the many technophobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid90s after the internet went mainstreambr br hollywood movies have always had their way in beautifying the depicted ongoings to make them look better and more appealing the same happens when hollywood tries to show us some hitech the outcome of such attempts varies from being very farfetched and ridiculous see hackers 1995 johnny mnemonic 1995 etc to being quite realistic see sneakers 1992br br the net lies somewhere between those extremes by nitpicking one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies and a lot of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more sexy and graphical than the way things are in real life as usually happens in moviesbr br however by simply overlooking those the viewer ends up with a quite solid entertaining movie the characters and acting are convincing and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it the plot is okay a fairly standard one really  based on the good ol paranoiac design but with a hitech edge this time and quite convincing again when disregarding technical issues the development of the plot is a bit sluggish though and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plotbr br the bonus here is cutiepie sandra bullock which besides being cute something she does quite easily apparently also portrays a solid act you can really feel her character  her despair her emotionsbr br in the bottom line the movie is entertaining and interesting rates about 7 from 10 in my scale its worth renting from the video library or even watching in the cinema whether to buy it or not is up to you
