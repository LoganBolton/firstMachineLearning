i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on pbs in 1983 i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the dell arte players but bill irwin floored mebr br i was most impressed at how a man of his size hes quite tall and beefy could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noisebr br most amazing for me though in this performance was the way he rose to his feet during the jackinthebox  marionette piece those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo he pulled himself up by the top of his head as if by a string and rose not just to his feet but to a full ballet pointand did it in one fluid seemingly effortless motion just consider the strength grace balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills and there lies a consummate actor  performer my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a boxbr br as to the unfortunate yestragic would be a better word unavailability of this piece in home media form i have noticed that much of pbs works are not available on tape or dvd sometimes pbs shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast but they seldom stay on the market for long there are exceptions of course but these are mainly the science and history documentaries rarely does an arts piece remain in print for longassuming it ever made it into vhs  dvd to begin with i dont know why this should be so certainly pbs could use the income from home media marketing of their shows but they dont take advantage of it much this is a shame there are many things ive watched on pbs that i wish to own but pieces such as the regard of flight are im afraid a oneshot once in a lifetime treat never to be repeated on pbs again and never to be available for home media purchase that really sucks im lucky to have caught it when i didbr br oh yeahour local library did get a copy of the regard of flight and yesit was stolen
