i am a fan of randolph scott westerns while some of them are amazingly clich√©d as are most westerns of this era his easy delivery and style really elevate the films to classic and nearclassic status while this film features yet another example of real life western heroes being exploited after their death by hollywood in this case bat masterson the film works well due to him as well as excellent supporting characters one is the always strong acting of robert ryanan excellent actor who is sadly almost forgotten today the other is the ubiquitous gabby hayes who has one of his best roles as the crusty and very colorful deputy here he is more enjoyable than in his many supporting roles for roy rogers and john waynemostly because his part is better written and hes given more to dobr br the plot is pretty much the plot of half the westerns ever made there are some baddies who hire a bunch of thugs to run roughshod over the locals and its up to a dogooder scott to restore the peace and kill off the villains however how the plot is executed is much better than average and due to this the film is still watchable fun just dont expect a whole lot of innovation or uniquenessunless you want to see what might just be gabby hayes best performance
