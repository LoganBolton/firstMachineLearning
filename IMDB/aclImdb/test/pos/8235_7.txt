during wwii there were a bazillion movies created by hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike however over 21 is unique in so many ways as it shows a side of the war you wont see in other filmsmaking it well worth seeing even if you have seen the bazillion other films br br alexander knox plays the male lead but the real lead of the film is irene dunnewho looks amazing for a 47 yearold lady yes i checkedshe really was this old when she made the film in over 21 the pair play husband and wife he enlists in the military much to the consternation of his father charles coburn and owner of the newspaper where knox is employed and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school the film shows little of knox in the school but instead centers on dunne as she lives in nearby spartan housing for spouses during this time she as the british say keeps a stiff upper lip and makes the best of iteven though she really isnt a housewife but a famous professional writer occasionally she gets very brief visits from her harried husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the meddling coburn at bay eventually she decides to stop the pesky coburn from phoning incessantly he always complains that his paper wont survive without his son by pretending to be knoxwriting wonderful editorials that everyone just assumes were written by himbr br while there is nothing earthshaking in this film its a very interesting slice of life move additionally the acting all around is very good its interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of ruth gordon a famous screenwriter and her husband garson kanin also a famous screenwriter as well as director when kanin joined the military during wwii gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this filmbr br by the way i noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it while it was very good it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was shortlived
