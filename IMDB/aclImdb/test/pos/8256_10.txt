this movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the uks biggest ever bank heists in fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes caper therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie a of a bunch of lovable rouges who are not the violent or psychotic types who with cheek an guile pull off the biggest job of their lives to be honest i dont really know too much about the real crime and cant comment if it accurately depicted the events that unfolded or the characters involvedbr br richard jordan handles himself very well playing pinky green and is very believable as an easy going small time american born crook who seems very comfortable with himself i have to add that sometimes american actors struggle gel well with english actors in a british made film the chemistry is not always there however this is no problem for jordon who fits right in with his rolebr br its worth pointing out that jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70s and 80s and never really got the recognition he deserved he seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and b movies not a fair representation of his acting ability he has played a corrupt cop in the friends of eddy coyle a sadistic killer in the mean season in the secret of my success he played a sort of comical gordon gehco character and also in the 1980s equalizer tv show he played a good guy all of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of david niven kurt russell edward woodward and robert mitchambr br in this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning you cant help liking green   you see he really did want to go straight but once blackmailed it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he relished the thought of all that moneybr br david niven is the boss and calls the shots the police inspector was brilliantly played by richard johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough london detective who clearly loves his job the other supporting cast dont say too much but looking at them they were all very well known british character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppersisnt that ironic elkie sommers oliver tobias do what they have to do and its good to see gloria graham in a cameo rolebr br to some viewers particularly americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with greens record could land a maintenance job at of all things a bank and come and go when he pleases in addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not as far fetched as it might seem back in the 1960s and 70s security was not as nearly as tight as it is nowbr br as for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations with small time crooks the haul here was too much there have been other movies where this occurs too ie the brinks mat its not just the disposal or the hiding of the loot but with so many people involved somebody is going to be careless is going to blab or just simply break once leaned on in addition the authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such huge robbery is carried out also they say there is no honor amongst thieves but ivan was adamant that pinky got his whack you only had too look at his stare in the dock if looks could kill a look of total betrayal how could he have dobbed them all in after taking care of him you have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid did green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around inspector watford was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed alibi the whole caper reeked of inside job in addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues a note pad with the safe numbers jotted down travel brochures for overseas trips still leaving his telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of characterbr br with some decent but common sense police work insp watford quickly had the measure of green picked him up and soon had him singing like a canary it just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly there is never a clean getaway for every body some are always going to get nabbed although its worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never recoveredbr br all in all an entertaining movie interesting shots of london and england in the late 70s well paced with a great ending i would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy capers  note i recently purchased a dvd of this but the transfer was obviously taken from a vhs tape and is of poor quality therefore do not pay too much for it
