superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to mary webbs period novel this film is a true masterpiece aside from the exceptionally talented rising star janet mcteer as the lead and one or two established actors the film used mostly little known names yet the drama was all the more convincing for that the social and personal tension is almost tangible and i felt as if the cast were reacting each others character as though they would have done in real life i saw that one commentator asked if janet mcteer really had a harelip a testimony to just how good was her characterisation i saw this on tv when it was first shown taped it then later the tape was sadly lost but it remains clear as anything in my mind if you have any fondness at all for the social period its an absolute must see
