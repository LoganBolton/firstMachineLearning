having known and loved this book since i was eleven i was terrified to see it coming up as a movie  what if theyd made a dreadful mess of it in the event i neednt have worried at all everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison which to me added nothing at all however it really is the most beautiful love story and im so glad i videoed it so i can watch it again and again my only gripe is  why didnt they give kester a green waistcoat which made him such a personable man such a simple thing when they went to so much trouble for everything else if you get the chance see this it is excellent
