when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre it had a profound effect on me its beautifully filmed and acted i immediately read the book by mary webb and it remains one of my all time favorites janet mcteer is wonderful as prue and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead br br i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years laterwith tumbleweeds this film would again become available to us alas it has not yet been released on dvd if anyone out there is listening please make this available again
