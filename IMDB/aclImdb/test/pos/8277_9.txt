the feature length cgi movie has just been released this year but whilst it will provide kids a lot of entertainment for diehard alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon shows the chipmunk adventure is probably the best alvin and the chipmunks based animated movie everbr br for starters the animation is as ever terrific the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons unlike the motion picture film itself it is just sheer fun to watch there are no celeb voices no cgi generated effects just pure quality 2d hand drawn animation and the colours are fantastic bright bold and beautiful the jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spoton in truth the chipmunk adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been but isnt alvin simon and theodore compete with the chipettes elenor jeanette and britney in a hot air balloon contest and along the way the kids encounter all manner of problems and dilemmas that they have to resolve in their own way and no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthemsbr br the chipmunk adventure is for kids and adults alike which is another advantage over the cgi movie as whereas the 2007 version will gain a few new admirers the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older chipmunk fans bagdarasian and karman provide the heliumlike voices of the films triobr br overall this film is a must for fans of the cartoon shows themselves you will not be left disappointed if you have seen the live action version then youll feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast if you havent then you should go and see it still or even still forget the jason lee movie and as an alternative stick with this
