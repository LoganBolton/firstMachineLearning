to this day there isnt a movie ive seen more times than the chipmunk adventure nor has any movie brought me more happiness this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest funniest most exciting film ever im still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80s pop think pat benetar on helium only catchier br br controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the chipettes song gettin lucky with you which to me seemed much more innocent at the time however looking at it as a rational adult i can totally understand the concern youve got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming getting lucky is what its all about the chipettes were definitely sexualized tenfold for this moviebr br but this controversial issue doesnt even come close to overshadowing the chipmunks otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie especially if you were a child of the eightiesearly nineties like me
