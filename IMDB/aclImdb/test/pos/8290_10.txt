the chipmunk adventure br br there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them and this nostalgic favorite is one of them the chipmunk adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation this time on the big screen in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didnt produce in the 80sbr br the story is simple and elementary having alvin simon  theodore compete in an aroundtheworld race with the chipettes janette eleanor  brittany however as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heistbr br the chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot and to people who didnt love it as a child the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable yet forgettable animated movie but for me it will always be a little known masterpiece something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films dobr br every song is fun upbeat and harmless highlights include the chipettes in a slightly risqu√© arabian dance to calm snakes theres also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe one thing about the chipmunk characters is that despite the potentially annoying vocals the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating this film is no exception it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80s if you ask mebr br every joke is cute sincere and amusing the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing and the shock of seeing the chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they dont miss anything but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertainedbr br its really just a fun trip that is completely humble in its ambitions the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is harmless fun ill be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review but nonetheless it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows and for me its this movie and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5 12 23 or older is a great film in my eyesbr br  a
