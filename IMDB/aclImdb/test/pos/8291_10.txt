one of my absolute favorite childhood films the chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature who could forget the dynamic boysgirls of rock n roll the exciting diamond dolls and the heartrending my mother br br this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties its too bad they dont make them like this anymore most animated films today resort to violence crude humor or sentimental mush except of course the folks from pixarbr br bottom line an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages
