ive loved this movie for a long time i hadnt seen it in a while so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young so naturally i adored the chipmunk adventurebr br i honestly cant think of a better plot to this movie its not wildly creative but ive always wanted to travel all over the world and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me crybr br the chipmunk adventure will remain a favorite of mine forever im sure i guess its because i saw it when i was so young i dont think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time unless of course they have a young heart
