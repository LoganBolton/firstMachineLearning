i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave
