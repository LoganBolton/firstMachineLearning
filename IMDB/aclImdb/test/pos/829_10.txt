wellits about time van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller thats his best film in recent years the plot isnt too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the exmarines as drug smugglers twist is cool but what makes this movie awesome is the fact that van damme is back to doing martial arts again his latest films have been more acting oriented but in the shepard jcvd is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape there are some impressive fight scenes and van damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360spinning heel kick for being a lowbudget action movie it does have good sets and great stunts van damme says some humorous lines and shows that hes improving as an actor im glad hes back to dealing out some van damageive been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films scott adkins is great in his role and van damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end overall its one of van dammes better films and it will keep you entertained a must rent for jcvd fans im just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like bloodsport or kickboxer nok su kow
