the main criticism of at the earths core is that its cheap the special effects are bad and so on and so forth yes some of the special effects are painfully bad but what a lot of folks overlook about it is that its actually quite fun which is very important in my bookbr br in comparison just look at the latest star wars films they have the latest greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet with all the razzle dazzle those films were as exciting as a funeral as yoda would say fun theyre not in other words who cares if the fx arent the greatest when the spirit of the film is fastpaced humorous and clearly set on the side of action i love everything about at the earths core the contrast between stodgy victorian england vs the wild otherworldly colorful setting of pellucidar the cast of characters the concept of a lost underground world the telepathic pterodactyls the human slaves rebelling jubal the ugly one lol the inspired teaming of peter cushing whos great and doug mcclure the excellent music its really good cinematography by the amazing alan hume and last but not least caroline munro shes effing sexy in this movie one of the sexiest bmovie babes ever captured on screenbr br seriously anyone who doesnt like this movie doesnt know what fun is gimme at the earths core over any turgid star wars prequels any time at least it has caroline munro which no cgi fx can ever recreate
