spoiler warningbr br i got this dinodocumentarie on dvd at christmas 2004 i had longed to see it and was by no means disappointed the score is memorable  mybr br favourites were the sauropod theme song and the winters coming song  the effects were dazzling you could almost believe they were there you actually learn something too  stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plates with blood female trexes might have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs i know theres a lot of people who thought this was based too much on speculation but there will always be questions that we can only guess at and there is a lot of hardcore undeniable fact as well we know that some dinosaurs travelled in herds we know that diplodocus swallowed stones to grind up vegetation in their stomaches despite this speculation the series did extremely well so well in fact that it spawned a followup a prequel and several specials if youre a dinofan then this is for you it makes jurassic park look small and weedy
