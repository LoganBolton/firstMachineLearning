we bought the dvd of walking with dinosaurs and have been nearly ecstatic over the things that are done so very well on itbr br many dvds today offer the bare minimum  the feature itself and maybe one other language which doesnt help the viewer at all but makes it easier for the company to see the dvd in multiple markets br br not so in the case of wwd there are so many wonderful extras and wellthoughtout vignettes that watching even the navigation menu is interesting the intros to each chapter in the making of dvd are laughoutloud funny the quality of the sound and video is terrific and of course the story and content  what more could a dinosaur lover ask forbr br i did watch most of the version broadcast on tdc narrated by avery brooks then watched about half of the dvd narrated by kenneth branaugh as near as i can tell the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly american slang terms in the narration ie in a section about t rex mating branugh says the female is tiring of the males attention and brooks says the honeymoon is overand cut out some of the closerin puppet work i prefer the branugh version simply because it is more completebr br overall a great value and wonderful production many kudos to the bbc and the crew that made this gem
