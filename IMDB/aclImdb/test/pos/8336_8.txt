spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or so of star witness were introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane theyre a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up theres suspense an oscarnominated script good acting everything you want old movies to beit is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot hes treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however ive only seen eight so perhaps thats an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it 8 out of 10
