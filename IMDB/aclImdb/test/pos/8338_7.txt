charles chic sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the leeds family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant he fought at bull run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high even after his soninlaw is beaten and one of his grandsons is kidnapped by the gang intimidating all the other members fear of his grandsons death is no excuse he says he wouldnt want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway the conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this oscarnominated story walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they dont back up their identification of the killer in court the rest of the cast including the sleazy killer ralph ince are all excellent and the film is snappily directed by william a wellman theres also good suspense as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin
