after seeing undisputed 2 i knew what to expect from isaac florentinebr br the shepherd border patrol is a decent flick not van dammes best but definitely not his worst there is some bad acting from vds supporting cast but it makes sensebr br the storyline and plot has all been done before so its nothing new i mean this is van damme we dont really expect much of an amazing plot do we so lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fightingbr br without giving anything away i thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of vds recent movies such as second in command in which the entire end fight is horrible with florentine behind the camera and if youve seen undisputed 2 he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it a few of the fights in the shepherd reminded me of vds older stuff which is what we all want to see the fights were good and i said hah awesome out loud a few times but i was hoping for just a bit more considering how good i thought undisputed 2 wasbr br something i found intriguing was vds daughter in the film i thought wow shes kinda hot come to find out its bianca van varenberg jcs real life daughter i have never seen her before so that was a nice treatbr br all in all this movie is not half bad yeah the story has been done before but at least jc was attempting to make a good movie next time though add more hand to hand combat i think he still has what it takes to do another big budget moviehis acting has improved since hes been doing dtvs and he really is in great shape at 47 i dont know about you but im one of the ones who thinks that most of his dtvs are actually good with the exception of derailed all he needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape and make a martial arts movieand i think people would respond well even though hes not jet li this movie is definitely worth the rental
