this movie is apparently intended for a young evangelical christian audience as a teaching tool for that i give it a 7 out of 10 point vote its a decent movie to show a youth group but i dont think it will be very well received beyond that for any other audience id rate it lots lowerbr br the reviewers that saw its a wonderful life in this were right on though i didnt think of that until they mentioned it i was more reminded of a chick tract those little 3 by 5 gospel comic books if jack chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts it would probably look a lot like second glance it has a strong christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth but it is somewhat hampered by christian stereotypes the christians are all very nice somewhat passive and squeaky clean while all of the nonchristians seem to be bad peoplebr br muriel the angel plays a major part and he is the corniest cheesiest character in the film he is the most unlikeable angel i have ever seen in any movie and the biggest negative i dont know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly or if he just struck me that way i admit that he reminded me of someone i know dans love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that i wish had been answeredbr br but the movie does display positive christian values and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson
