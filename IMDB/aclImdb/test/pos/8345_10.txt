i am a college student and i bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest movie ever madebr br it is especially good to watch if you are an atheist like me because then you can see how silly these christian people are they seem to think nonbelievers like to live in really disgusting messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors its a laugh riotbr br my buddies and i watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our wildest imaginations see this movie nowbr br lets hope rich christiano makes some more of these movies to entertain us heathens
