lady and the tramp ii is very colourfully animated and the songs especially that of the junkyard dogs are quite good however the family seems even too idyllic and i cant help understanding that scamp is discontented when everything is forbidden however i also pity angel who never has had a loving family until she meets jim dear and darlingbr br in any case its clear that the original lady and the tramp is better than this sequel
