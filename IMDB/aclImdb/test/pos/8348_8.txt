i loved this film almost as much as the origional versionwhat teenager doesnt go through what scamps going throughwanting to find independence by getting more and more distant from your familythe songs were nice toand the character designs were greatlady and tramp look almost exactly like they did in the origional featurethey did a good job on the voices of those twotoo considering the fact that the origional voice actors are probably deadhoweveri do think they shouldve given more lines to ladyannettecoletteand danieloh wellat least they had the common sense to keep the same scenery from the original film
