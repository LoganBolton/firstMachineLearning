since watching the trailer in the little mermaid ii return to the sea dvd i had a feeling that this movie is gonna be great cause i am a huge disney fan and guess what im right this movie is a very worthy successor to the original classic lady and the trampbr br it tells the story of scamp lady and tramps mischievious son scamp who wants to be wild and free instead of living a housedog life though the movie might not be as good as the first one it has a great moral that you couldnt find anywhere else until you watch itbr br i admit that the movie isnt for everyone but those of you who hate it all i can say is that you dont have a spirit for this and i suggest that you shouldnt go see it again but hey its really an awesome story packed with brilliant animation music and starstudded voice talents featuring scott wolfparty of five and alyssa milanocharmed so if you havent seen the movie why standing there go and grab the copy
