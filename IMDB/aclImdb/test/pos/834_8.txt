well it is a good movie however you have to admit that van dames movies havent been so great lately on the other hand if you are a hardcore van dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes also what i really liked is the music beautiful music am sure this will kill time if you are action fan as for isaac florentine the director of undisputed 2 i dont think he did a good job as he did with undisputedi cant wait when one day van dames movies hit the cinemas before the dvd maybe one daybr br in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch this could make your hour and half fun
