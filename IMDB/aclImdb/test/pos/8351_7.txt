minor spoilersbr br you know its getting to the point where walt disney television animation might just as well be called walt disney sequel animation these sequels range from excellent beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas and the fantastic lion king ii simbas pride to horrible the return of jafar this is of course my personal opinion now disney brings us their latest sequel scamps adventure and while it is flawed it is still entertainingbr br the quality of animation is not up to par with disney feature animation still the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life lady and tramp have not aged a day since 1955 trusty still talks about his sense of smell and ol reliable and jock still gives him grief about it theres a nice fight between tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessorbr br i really dont care for most of the songs though roger bart and susan eganthe singing voices of scamp and angelsing their parts very nicely both melissa manchester and norman gimbel have done much better work in the past danny troobs score is okay but nothing memorable and some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage that is they really dont do muchbr br the voice work on the other hand is quite good while i dont like jeff bennett as the dogcatcher he is very good as tramp chazz palminteri does a nice job as buster leader of the junkyard gang and alyssa milano gives what may be her best performance as angel then there is scamp who is the spitting image of his dad he is voiced to perfection by scott wolf wolf does a superb job of showing scamps wild streak and his soft sidebr br all in all while scamps adventure is flawed it still makes for rather entertaining viewing it is my hope however that walt disney television animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releasesbr br
