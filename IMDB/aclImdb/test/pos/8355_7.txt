well first of all its not a bad movie it is good and i like the characters introduced i also like lady and tramps voices more in thisbr br however i would like to see lady and tramp more i know it says scamps adventure and i love scamp and angel to bits but its a sequel to the original where in my opinion they should of just released it as scamps adventure not lady and the tramp iiscamps adventurebr br tramp did have quite a role but he didnt have much time with ladybr br but anyway the songs are quite good and scamp and angel are sweet ive seen better sequels but hey its not a failurebr br i give it 710 very good but still had flaws
