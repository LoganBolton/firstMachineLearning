where do i begin walt disneys happiest motion picture lady and the tramp is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical canon of disney animation the sequel however is to say the very least enjoyable i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie it was flameshield up adorable the broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and i was humming the songs for the rest of the night i can if you asked me to still sing all of the songsbr br but where the movie was really good for me it was bad in a lot of other places the animation was kind of scary at times every time there was a close up shot of someones face i dont know it just seemed scary to me also where the hell was lady she gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs scamp at the end she gets 0 interaction with the plot and her only sonbr br but all in all i liked it compared to the original does it hold up no the songs arent as good still kind of catchy though the plot was a lot less involved lady had almost nothing to do with it and its not as cute as the first one but if you go in with an open mind youll have fun and maybe gasp like it
