aslan adam or lionman as its more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with an epic battle as king solomon  his army defeats a load of guys although im not sure who they were  the film itself isnt too helpful in establishing the fact anyway after king solomon has slaughtered all these guys princess maria bishop osorio  commander antoine are forced to sign a treaty which lets king solomon rule just about everything in sight soon after princess maria seduces solomon  they have sex meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever just two sentences long antoine weds princess maria  is planning to rebel against solomon  gain some sweet revenge in the process antoine  his guards attack  kill solomon even though his pregnant wife princess almunia escapes with her protector rostin with antoines guards in hot pursuit after the shortest labour ever less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush princess almunia gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some bushes away from antoines guards unfortunately when rostin tries to retrieve the little fella he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of lions as one of their own years later  the evil antoine now rules treating his subjects with no mercy princess maria has given birth  he has a son but rostin is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow antoine the task seems hopeless unless they can enlist the help of the legendary lionman who is more beast than manbr br this turkish greek coproduction was directed by natuk baytan as natuch baitan  is a one of a kind type of film i found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining the script never seems to take itself seriously it is a pretty funny film at times it moves along like a rocket  is never dull or boring  some of the english dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with whats happening on screen none of it makes any sense we get a boy raised by lions an evil king betrayal dark family secrets birthmarks that form the shape of lions in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by lions crazy fight scenes torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to be tied to wobble ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires  gymnastic rings idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair  a central character who has a jaw line resembling a housebrick can be stabbed twice have his hands covered in acid this acid can eat its way through steel trapdoors but is kept in a ceramic jug  fall over 20 feet onto a concrete floor  yet maintain no serious injury aslan adam is a terrifically entertaining film i dont think ive seen another film quite like it that i can compare it too if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like sobadtheyregood type films  want to have fun laugh  be entertained then aslan adam should be at the very top of your list total 100 gold for bad film fans  those with a taste for the different  bizarre on the disappointing side lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end which is a shamebr br director bayten certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although its far from well made during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a grassy hill with trees in the background there is one point where lionman uses a branch to pole vault but its obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it then theres the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds are supposed the chasing lionman down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever there are just so many individual scenes in aslan adam that are just hilarious stupid bizarre or all three that i could go on forever just check the ending out when lionman is jumping  flying about everywhere like he can fly theres lots of blood in aslan adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence a few stabbings  someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it getsbr br technically aslan adam is pretty ropey the period costumes are bright  garish featuring purples yellows reds  various other bright colours the fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could the music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film  is yet another bizarre aspect to aslan adam the acting was bad even dubbed you could tell the acting was badbr br aslan adam is pure gold from start to finish there are so many things to like laugh at  enjoy in this film that i just ended up really liking it in no way whatsoever can aslan adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but its one hell of an entertaining one i may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that i didnt dream it all the best turkish action film about a man raised by lions you will ever see period proved popular enough to spawn a sequel lionman ii the witchqueen 1979
