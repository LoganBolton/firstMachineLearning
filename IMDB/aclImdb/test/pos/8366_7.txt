shuai is a burly and uncouth young beijinger with a punkish haircut who ekes out a living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market he wouldnt appear to have anything in common with the wiry middleaged wouldbe intellectual zhang  and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the pros and cons of murder the chinese title would perhaps be better translated as talk it over if that makes it sound kind of pedestrian dont be misled this film is profusely inventive in its plot and mostly races along at breakneck speed although the pace does flag quite badly towards the endbr br if you only know zhang yimous worthy historical dramas like raise the red lantern and shanghai triad or his more recent martial arts epics hero and house of flying daggers youll be amazed in fact whichever of his other films youve seen youll be surprised pleasantly surprised  this is far and away his most original most quirky most experimental work it was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget almost entirely on location in beijing and making use of many ordinary beijingers in the smaller supporting roles  theres even a fleeting cameo by the director himself and mostly with a handheld camera in a jerky hyperkinetic style which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his bestknown filmsbr br ok i live in beijing so i find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that i am coming to recognise and relish even though it was shot in 97 and things are changing so rapidly here but i really think this film can be appreciated by anyone i saw it as i have so many other chinese comedies at a movie club that screens subtitled versions of recent chinese films for an almost exclusively expat audience and it is the only one i can recall where the audience was laughing out loud some nonchinese audiences might find it a little too strange a little uncomfortable at times in that it does include some violence and after opening as a breezy offbeat romantic comedy mutates into something much darker in its second half it is however very very funnybr br its also superbly acted by the two leads especially longtime zhang yimou collaborator jiang wen who is probably mainland chinas foremost film star and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or de nirobr br watch this film  for proof that the chinese have a sense of humour that can translate to other cultures for proof that zhang yimou is far far more than a onetrick pony and for a thoroughly good time
