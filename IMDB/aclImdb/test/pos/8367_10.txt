i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this after seeing yimou zhangs hero i decided to check his other movies perhaps looking for something similar the second yimou zhangs movie i watched was no one less after which i realized what kind of cinema im now in no wonder why i got keep cool immediately it is a simple touching and brilliant piece of cinema i pay my respect to the directorbr br this movie shows that its not the amount of money makes film good its all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this the story is very simple a typical extract of a typical daily life moreover shown in a very simple way the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhangs films
