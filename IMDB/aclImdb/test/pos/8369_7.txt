this is not the best movie you might ever see but it still is very refreshing of course it has its flaws it has its humbling moments and yet at the same time its different from all the sht youre used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this you might recognize a little from the masterpiece amelie when you see the opening i give it 7 out of 10 but still reccomend it to you if youre tired of the usual bore you can rent in the videostore
