hong kong the 1920s a young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding much against his fathers will he helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman whose goons then come after them and terrorizes the young mans uncles noodle restaurant the uncle turns out to be an old reformed triad assassin who now helps the young guy become proficient in martial arts its allout karate kid style with wash the wok instead of wax on wax off the kung fu villain is the ruthless businessmans son who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealisticbr br but the story which develops over time has an epic feel good characterization great kung fu and is generally very entertaining the young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for the romance dimension remains undeveloped though which is a bit disappointing otherwise a great moviebr br my rating 8 out of 10
