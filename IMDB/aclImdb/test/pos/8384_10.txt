thats what i thought when i heard about the cast of inglorious basterds and im both from germany and into moviesbr br that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series  and even there he didnt play the main parts obviously nobody ever noticed what hes capable of now thanks to qt he got one shot to change that  and  lets put it this way  that was a bingo he is the living proof of what a great caster tarrantino isbr br by the way i think its a great privilege to watch the movie as a german  being able to understand everything and the german dialog is written almost as good as the englishbr br now i could repeat what many others have written here before ill put it short finally qt is back
