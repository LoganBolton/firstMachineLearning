i cant imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than quentin tarantinos at least in his films inglourious basterds is no different we all know tarantino the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics such as reservoir dogs and pulp fiction since he has been a disappointment for some well i am relieved to say tarantino has not lost his touch he brings us his best since pulp fiction and thankfully sobr br we know the story a wwii tale told only as tarantino can fictional of course a war film hasnt been done like this before brad pitt as lt aldo raine leads the basterds in nazi occupied france their goal  killin nazis christoph waltz as colonel hans landa plays a similar role on the other side hes know as the jew hunter and goes about his business as ruthless as no other the third sub story consists of a young jewish refugee shosanna dreyfus who witnesses the slaughter of her family and she of course wishes to plot revenge on the germans for her devastating lose there actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other if you know anything about tarantino or his films this is nothing new for himbr br war has never been been so fun the basterds are haunting but at the same time very funny at times even hilarious the dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other tarantino films the entertainment and hilarity is led by brad pitt i found him extremely funny and entertaining i couldnt wait to see him on screen again even with his crazy accent he works in this type of film also making great impressions were m√©lanie laurent and christoph waltz who were tremendous the film was filled with noteworthy performancesbr br the story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to even count but so what it isnt meant to be a documentary tarantino wanted to have fun with as should we the cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film youve really got to love the last line in the film but pulp fiction remains his masterpiecebr br quentin tarantino among all other things is an entertainer wwii is one of the most tragic events in history but tarantino some how manages to make it fun inglourious basterds is a fun film its tremendously entertaining shocking dramatic suspenseful and funny at the same time jam packed with everything you look for in a movie done with that certain tarantino style its worth being checked out its time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of quentin tarantino
