inglorious basterds makes no apologies asks for no forgiveness its a no holds barred assault on the senses tarantino doesnt care if he offends if he steps all over stereotypes and clich√©s this is film making at it purest its great to see a film maker whose work clearly isnt interfeared with by the powers that be tarantino is a master of effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments youre not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing either way its a roller coaster and one not to be missed its not for everyone and im unsure how germans will take the film certainly if youre not a fan of tarantinos style this may be a little hard to swallow but nevertheless it is a film which simply has to be seen no self respecting film fan should miss this and the performance of christoph waltz oscar dont you dare ignore him
