while i agree completely with drvn below about mary mccormack flopping a milkbag out on tv the rest of the show is fantastic phil hartman was great in a professorly way teaching the celebs the ins and outs foleys a nut but in a good way you never know what self depricating humor hes going to come up with next as for the game play its entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game too bad it isnt on anymore  i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it doesnt appear to be scheduled for any time in the future bad bravo you deserve a beating
