i watch this movie without big expectations i think everyone should do its a great tvserie and of course we couldnt compare it with gone with the wind but its still nice to watch its also weird to see a different scarlett joanne whalley dont play scarlett with passion and fire like vivien leigh but i believe that scarlett is changed when she became older dont expect to much of this just watch but dont watch like i think this would be horrible
