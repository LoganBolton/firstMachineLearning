the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner 701 scorpion is one of my alltime favorites the sequel jailhouse 41 is nearly as good its generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as fp701 its much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but theres more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off Â– and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofylooking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yukis story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and itos direction is masterful its too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp701 series this is an awesome film
