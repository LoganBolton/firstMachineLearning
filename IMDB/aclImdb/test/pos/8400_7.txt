this miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original gone with the wind if one views this on its own merit and not immediately following the original it comes out pretty good i am sure that most viewers will question the performances of scarlett and rhett but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better many of the characters here are new to this storyline so comparison in those cases rhetts mother uncle henry hamilton will benteenis not a problem no one will every be vivien leigh or clark gablebr br the best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of springtime charleston and ireland watch it for that alone obviously this was a high budget tv miniseries it follows the book for a while then has a totally new plot when scarlett goes to irelandbr br the acting is credible if nothing specialkind of the way i feel about roger moore following sean connery for james bond
