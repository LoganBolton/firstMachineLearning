a letter to the guys i tried guys i really tried i tried so hard not to watch this movie i would leave the room when it was on or jump on the computer when the wife watched it this is her second favorite movie the godfather being first which i lovebr br i ended up catching little bits of this movie and finally after maybe a year i was actually sitting down watching it with her i cant believe i am saying this but i loved this movie dalton plays a great rhett and has his cockiness down pat whalley plays a delightful scarlett full of fire and brimstone and nothing is going to stop herbr br my favorite scene is when she is overseas in ireland and the government is going to tear down a peasants house because they are behind in the rent scarlett gets all mad at this and pays the entire debt thus making a huge name for herself around this small townbr br all im saying guys is you might want to try this movie especially if you are a fan of gone with the wind it does take a little bit to get used to the new actors but i think you will find them refreshing
