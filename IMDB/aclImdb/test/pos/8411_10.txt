ive always loved gone with the wind and have seen it numerous times however its ending left me not only hanging but depressed with a hopeless feeling finally in scarlett ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying end beginning of the original storybr br it follows that someone of scarletts obvious intelligence as originally written would eventually grow up although like most people i fell in love with scarlett in gwtw i tired of her constant insipid infantiilism to the point of exasperation and i was disappointed that mitchell did not show scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally thankfully someone finally did after all isnt that nagging immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason rhett finally gave up on her in the first place i think ripley did an excellent job of describing that longoverdue process and whalleykilmer did a superb job of portraying it joanne wk has all the fire exuberance and intelligent sparkle as did vivian leigh and she is certainly at least as if not more beautifulbr br there was is and always will be only one clark gable however if i had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which ive been exposed to portray him in his biography it would definitely be timothy dalton dalton possesses the same elegant charm that gable did which is essential for rhetts character i cant imagine anyone else who could come closebr br in my opinion both joanne whalleykilmer and timothy dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played scarlett and rhett i think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their charactersbr br i enjoyed the whole cast julie harris was her usual delightful presence and jean smart was an adorable kick even ashleys character was nicely played by stephen collins and the progression of his relationship with scarlett was totally believablebr br the story became a little convoluted in ireland but so is life after all and i still found it entertainingbr br all in all i thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of ripleys imagination i wish id written itbr br
