i didnt read the book scarlett and when i watched this mini series i enjoyed it very much and thought it didnt need to be compared to gwtw the story may differ from the book but who cares its a movie even in the credits its based on the book its not the book the film is clearly under appreciated with the reviews that other people write but cant even spell the main characters names rightbr br  the acting in scarlett i thought was superb joanne whalley and timothy dalton were excellent they took the characters and gave them there touch now as far as other people go by they compare them to the great vivian leigh and clark gable they obviously did fantastic but the leads in this film are completely different people who have there own acting methods and shouldnt be pressured of what people have to say if you wanted certain actors to do well then you should have directed the film im sure that other actors would not do as well as these with the chemistry and cleverness they brought to these roles the supporting cast stood out with there grandness and jean smart steals the scenes that shes in with her comedy geniusbr br  the locations in the film were very beautiful and it was just grand to see scarlett go to all those places in the film as she causes trouble and other things also the scene in which scarlett talks to her dads grave it was very dramatic and i thought from then on that there were two great actresses who brought scarlett ohara to life not just vivian leigh but also joanne whalleybr br the film and the book may differ but you must not take to heart that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made otherwise you will think that this has to be like gone with the wind and you will not like this film but this is an under rated classic that is unlike gwtw its its own movie also keep in mind that tomorrow is another day
