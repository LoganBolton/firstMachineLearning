i am a maharashtrian a teenager living in the 21st century and its obvious that im not much into even bollywood let alone marathi movies yet when i watched shwaas it left me with a unique feeling one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of generatingbr br it is a fact that like most indian movies the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its marathi dialogues which however hard one tries can not be effectively translated into englishbr br shwaas explores in intricate detail the relationship between a grandparent and a child and it does complete justice to this strong bond dialogues like mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahemy parsha is also one in a million enhance the emotion anyone who has closely observed the grandparent  child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the moviebr br overall it definitely worth watching its a movie that has left a profound effect on me i will surely recommend it to anyone
