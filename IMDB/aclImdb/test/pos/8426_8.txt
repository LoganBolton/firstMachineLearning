here is one of jane austens movies that i found very delightful i read the book first then listened to it on cd and was captivated by how a young victorian girl could be persuaded against marrying the man she loved due to his lack of a fortune or education the joy of knowing that anne is evidently reunited with a lost love the fact that her godmother tries to marry her off to a good for nothing cousin whos only out for money looking at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how class distinctions can divide couples from following their hearts captain wentworth realization that he still loves anne after seven years his final understanding that annes love was constant all that time and they she wasnt going to let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage to one she truly loved
