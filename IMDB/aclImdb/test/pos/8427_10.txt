i finally found a version of persuasion that i like anne doesnt look like a scullery maid in this version just a very thin aging pretty woman quite like shes described in the book captain wentworth doesnt look like hes 50 nor does he look perpetually angry but rather as hes described in the book he hasnt aged as much as anne and is quite handsome and they play their parts with such conviction and realismthats what acting is all about they were believable they created real characters and it was like the characters in the book came to life if you havent seen this version i urge you to find it order it or request it from either a bookstore or a library if you must its worth the price and worth the wait br br i watched the 1995 version and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two why it isnt rated higher is beyond my comprehension the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life
