im just getting the chance to dig into past austen films and i picked this up because persuasion is has been and always will be my favorite work by jane austen and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my playerbr br i wasnt disappointed either i knew there were bound to be some drawbacks so ill state them and try not to be too thick about them anne elliot is the most introverted of austens characters she is the least talkative and the least witty there are passages in the book where anne says nothing  only her feelings are described this works fine in print but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen short of doing thoughtful voice overs which would grow tedious over four hours youre left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing and must communicate all by her facial expression this can leave the feeling that the film is slow and lacking in purpose if you need a more overt style of austen then certainly this film is not for you but if subdued is more your style and you tend to pick up on unspoken vibes this will fulfill all expectationsbr br anne firbank as anne elliot is thankfully an actress whose face can convey much she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look not a knockout  anne wasnt supposed to be the elegant one of the family  nor in her first youth  which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and makeup what you see is someone who is very like austens character someone whose appearance you might pass over once but hear her speak and look more closely and she grows more attractive the better you know her this is anne elliot as brought to life by anne firbankbr br captain wentworths portrayal is ably handled by bryan marshall the bitterness is never apparently obvious save at the concert scene and yes i found it hard to believe he wound find louisa musgrove interesting as she was shown but that is another point of austens book he did not find her interesting he tried to find her interesting and ultimately failed sigh of relief so this too fits with austens original storybr br i especially liked the portrayal of lady russell who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad this also comes out in this adaptationbr br so this is one film which closely followed the book i could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced but id run out of space here charles musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters good fun mary the most annoying i was dying to have her just shut up  but i had that feeling when i read the book too captains and the admiral i thought charmingbr br the cinematography i thought a trifle stiff there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another  perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie one scene  chop  the next scene the actors enter from right proceed left and  chop  another scene where the same thing happens this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little a low budget has to show itself somewhere i supposebr br and as i said earlier if you like some pace to go with jane austen dont bother with this one as youll find it way too slow i enjoyed it enormously though as it brought a wealth of detail the sets were richly elegant to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel i highly recommend it
