it was harrowingly close but the china syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when as it was going into theatrical release the accident at three mile island nuclear power plant happened i still remember the whole countrys attention was glued onto hourly bulletins coming out of harrisburg pennsylvania and wouldnt you know it a scientist in the china syndrome describes the worst case scenario as rendering an area as large as the state of pennsylvania uninhabitablebr br less than a decade later in the ukraine at chernobyl the soviet union in its last days dealt with such a crisis that didnt get righted in the nick of time the china syndrome once again became a relevant moviebr br the film is more about cutting corners for safety than it is about being antinuclear jack lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of an atomic power submarine what angers him and sets him off to create the confrontation that climaxes the film is the stupidity and greed of the power company managers stupidity and greed though are commodities found every day the problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human societybr br lemmon shares star billing with a couple of famous hollywood offspring jane fonda and michael douglas jane is a tv news reporter who is constantly being assigned to puff feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs the coverup by her own station and her later meeting with lemmon set off the chain of events depicted in the china syndromebr br fondas best scene i thought however was with peter donat a news executive with her station take a look at her facial expressions as donat fluffs off the importance of the story and patronizingly tells her that her very beauty demands she stick to puff pieces fonda knows shes got something and sticks with itbr br michael douglas plays her iconoclastic cameraman this was a typical part for him back in the day in his tcm tribute to his father kirk douglas michael said he opted for roles showing sensitivity still i could have seen a young kirk douglas in this partbr br what to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations a vexing problem that will bedevil our government for a couple of generations to come this film shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear power our current problems geopolitically in the world stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuel specifically oil everything we use brings consequence some unforeseen br br the real hero of the film in my opinion is wilford brimley lemmons colleague at the nuclear power plant in the end brimley really steps up to the platebr br see the china syndrome to know what im talking about
