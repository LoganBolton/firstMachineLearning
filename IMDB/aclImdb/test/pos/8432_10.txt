highly politically charged drama that while biased is extremely wellhandled and one of the most intelligent films ever made it contains almost no preaching but rather follows a naive tv reporter who gradually comes to realize the threat presented by nuclear power plants not because of an inherent danger but because the purveyors are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those affectedbr br many hated the film because they saw it as a political tract made by ultraliberals like jane fonda and michael douglas but if you view it simply as a drama its gripping exciting full of welldeveloped distinctive characters and ultimately a truly suspenseful contemporary thriller that hits close to homebr br historical note for some especially those in the energy industry and inhabitants of the harrisburg pa metro area it hit perhaps a little too close to home as less than a week after this film was released the devastating explosion at the three mile island nuclear facility occurredbr br update 04082007 in the nearly a decade since i first wrote this critique ive heard a lot of commentary on the film one thing i think really needs to be noted is that this film is not the ultraliberal antinuclear tirade that its often tagged as beingbr br while the makers and stars are or were notable hollywood establishment liberals what this film attacks is not the very idea of nuclear power but rather the idea of human greed corruption and fallibility calling into question the potential hazards of something that nature has already made dangerousbr br no one who accepts reality can argue the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal close friends of mine who worked at a nuclear plant for several years even told me of their employers official policy on the maximum safe exposure levels that its employees could handlebr br you dont have to believe that corporations are inherently evil in order to accept that individuals in pursuit of wealth and power are greedy and often corrupt and even if you refute that claim you cant dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes when it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation we cant afford any mistakes and that more than anything is the argument this film seeks to makebr br condemn it if you must but try to have a little perspective were currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are quite different from those originally predicted an incredibly costly war with no end in sight and whether or not you feel the war was necessary to combat global terrorism you cant dispute the reality that the length the financial cost and most importantly the loss of human life have all far exceeded the levels that the experts assured us of back in 2003 so even if no one involved is greedy or corrupt mistakes were made and mistakes of a pretty serious magnitude to boot the same kind of serious mistakes if allowed to arise in the nuclear industry could render much of the earths surface uninhabitable
