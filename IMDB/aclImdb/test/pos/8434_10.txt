i wish hollywood would make more movies like the china syndrome because this one scores on every level br br it has an intelligent believable script it shows you that its not only nuclear power itself but the money involved in it that causes danger and the movie also gives you a great behindthescenes look of how television is madebr br it scores as a thriller the first time i saw it it kept me right on the edge of my seat and it scores as a charactermovie i really cared for the main characters jane fonda michael douglas wilford brimley and most of all jack lemmon are great
