as long as you dont mind paying a little more attention than you normally might for other films this is one of the best thrillers youll ever see the film portrays an incident that might occur in real life nothing in it seems fictional at all in fact it also portrays how people might react in real lifebr br in fact it portrays these so well that is seems like real life combine that with the lack of a soundtrack and youve almost got the best newslike movie youve ever seen jane fonda and jack lemmon are particularly good in this lateseventies masterpiece evoking concern on her end and genuine tragic pity on his end i highly recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers
