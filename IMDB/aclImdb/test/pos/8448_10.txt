again ive read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones but totally disagree with those who think it wasis hokumbr br personally i think nuclear is about the only energy left to us unless our governments feds and states increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photocells on their roofs many attractive and pricey homes in southern calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around the sun i live in a loft which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day i hardly use the ac  im sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler we are blessed with dry heat in this part of the country im from the gulf coast of the usa so i know about humiditybr br that said i found the china syndrome to be a convincing movie about what could go wrong if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants i think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague they are safe tmi is still onlinebr br director james bridges carefully guides this plot by mike grayt s cook to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film all the roles were wellplayed jane fonda kimberly wells jack lemmon jack godell and producer michael douglas richard adams are all excellent in their roles plus all of the rest of the cast i too loved there being no score it was so interesting to get a truetolife glimpse of the behindthescenes of the tv industry  that shouldnt be surprising currently dan rather is sueing cbs and i hope he wins can you believe donald trump saying hes a loser  trump  who cares tiberius1234 posted a very good comment here  i agree it is my opinion that getting vaporized by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted and becomes blade runner andor solyent green come away from your videogames for a couple of hours and watch this dated movie really isnt and get a little education on nuclear energy i recommend it to the whole family
