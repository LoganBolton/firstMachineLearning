when the china syndrome was released plenty of rightwing critics and pronuke supporters blasted this film particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power but it only took two weeks and a nearcatastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics upbr br fonda and douglas are the la news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the ventana nuclear power plant douglas films the event through the plants soundproof glass but the tv station will not air the footage fearing a massive lawsuit it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth despite a massive attempt by the plants owners to cover up the accidentbr br but a conscientious shift supervisor jack lemmon has uncovered certain defects in the plants pump support structure he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that though it would be extremely costly and lengthy if repairs arent made the next accident could be apocalyptic but he cant get anyone who works with him to believe his story the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political technological and human interest stories together in one disturbing packagebr br while obviously quite politically liberal in nature the china syndrome well directed and cowritten by james bridges the paper chase is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together fundamentally nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect that is what the film is saying and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way it says it brilliantly
