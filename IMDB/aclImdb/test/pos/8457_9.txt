the first thing you see in this film is a static angleone which will be repeated later in the film depicting the chaos going onunseen to the audience in a studio that airs news soon after fondas characters typical story is shown in that same angle dont let this mislead you the film is not about a female reporter a woman struggling to succeed in a maledominated profession that is merely a leadin a way of starting the filmthough its used later the actual point to this production is revealed gradually and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on the entire film has that pace not slow or drawnout but deliberate its never really fast even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so this pacingespecially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed as the disturbing unsettling nature of the film is unraveled is strong almost painful to the viewer it inspires you to if it had been possible jump into the screen grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to remedy the situation never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment the subject is extremely important to be aware of and its handled perfectly here no overdramatizationwell very little anyway just an accurate presentation of the issue the direction is astounding the empathy felt for lemmons character is profound the editing is masterful one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly the editor judging from his filmography is vastly underrated the writing was excellent the acting was great in particular by lemmon fonda and douglaswho also produced it the lack of a score is perfect no music is needed to enhance the ending is sublime and effective the movie does have a few negative points among them some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition one particular part of the film whilst dramatic doesnt seem to mesh with something that follows it not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly and rightfully so attributed to bad movies the pacingwhich can be mistaken as being slow and the lack of score one could argue that to be a negative thing as everyone ought to consider the points it presents but maybe its better this way handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respectfor the topic as well as the viewer something like this maybe it shouldnt be spoonfed i was mesmerized with the film and left very taken aback i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it 910
