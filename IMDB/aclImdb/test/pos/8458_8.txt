intelligent nailbiting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america when life imitated the film a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant ostensibly a stuck valve problem a tv newscrews film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportionsand worse that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars a coverup that endangers everyones lives the movie occasionally gets too technical especially in the secondhalf and could use more human interplay however the performances by jack lemmon jane fonda as a puffpiece newswoman in the right place at the right time and michael douglas as a freelance cameraman are superb the throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical and the newsbiz with its corporate structure and vapid yesmen is vividly captured 12 from
