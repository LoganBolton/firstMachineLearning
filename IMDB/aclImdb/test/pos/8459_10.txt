i normally dont comment on movies on imdb but in this case i feel like i should i love movies and i want to make them and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmakingbr br this is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen originally seeing it air on amc i believe and then on the dvd i just watched that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach that little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thrillerbr br jack lemmons performance is a fine one and jane fonda and michael douglas follow i felt so much empathy of lemmon whos character jack godell only wanted people to listen to his warningbr br but what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score and this is also what makes it beautiful to me apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension because none is needed and while the credits run white on black in silence it drives the point homebr br i use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever couldbr br i highly recommend this movie it is one of my favorites if you like movies you wont be disappointed if you like movie soundtracks more you might not want to give this one a go
