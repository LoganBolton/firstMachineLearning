this is a pretty interesting experiment to watch its the first ever still existing attempt to unite sight with sound it features two men dancing to a violin player possibly william kl dickson himself who is standing next to an edison recording cylinder that is capturing the soundbr br the sound and images were not linked together as one yet and it wasnt until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together its probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picturebr br the movie is made by william kl dickson a assistant to thomas edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound the answer he provided was the kinetophone a kinetoscope basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it so people could watch the moving images with a cylinder phonograph inside of it for the sound this is the first that we know off surviving movieexperiments that feature this technique all of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately so the kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound in some cases people could even choose from three sound cylinders featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images only 45 kinetophones were ever made so you could hardly call the kinephone a success also after this experiment focus went off to other cinema techniques mainly regarding movieprojectorsbr br so the experiment itself obviously did not become a success also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released they just couldnt yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available it would had been a very expensive job to do so it therefor really isnt the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but its very interesting to watch how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and moviemakingbr br 810
