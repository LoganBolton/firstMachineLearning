the very first talking picture has returned from oblivion and now you can hear it and see it in autumn of 1894 at the edison lab complex in west orange new jersey thomas edisons associate william dickson tried to combine two existing technologies the phonograph and the kinetoscope to record sound and image together in the event dickson was unable to synchronise the playback of sound and image so this experimental film was never released to paying audiences  and consequently unlike many silent films which dickson made for edison at this time it has no official title the silent image recorded at 40 fps has been in the library of congress for years known to film historians as a mute curiosity it was also known that the soundtrack had been recorded on one of the crude wax cylinders languishing at the edison national historic site  although nobody knew which onebr br but now thats changed recently curators located the wax cylinder which had broken into several pieces these were reassembled a playback was obtained and the sound was digitised hollywoods veteran soundtrack editor walter murch cleaned up the background noise and tweaked the digitisation to make it synch with the film image which murch had digitally compressed to 30 fps sound and image are synchronised at lastbr br the film begins with an offscreen mans voice calling the rest of you fellows ready go ahead the unseen speaker remains unidentified but was probably dicksons assistant fred ott on screen dickson plays a violin into an immense funnel mounted on a tripod one of edisons soundrecording devices while alongside him in full view of the camera two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing to the tempo of dicksons musicbr br the film lasts barely 17 seconds just long enough for us to marvel at this crude technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men waltzing in each others arms speaking of which heres a warning a wellknown but extremely inaccurate reference book the celluloid closet by the late vito russo includes a frame enlargement from this movie and identifies it as the gay brothers thats incorrect the gay brothers is an entirely different movie made by dickson at the edison lab during this same period the gay brothers never had a soundtrack its a brief fiction film about two brothers who are not gay in the sense russo meant it the deceased mr russo for his own reasons wanted us to perceive dicksons experimental sound film arguably the first movie musical as an artefact of 19thcentury homoeroticism hmm what is it about gay men and musicals sorry but theres just no such content herebr br this vitally important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10 ive often maintained that no lost movie should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed im delighted to report that this film is finally available to audiences as its producer intended it more than a century after it was filmed
