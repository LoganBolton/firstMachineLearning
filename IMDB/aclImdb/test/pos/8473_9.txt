a masterful performance by jamie foxx is just one of the highlights of ray a 2004 film also starring kerry washington regina king curtis armstrong richard schiff sharon warren patrick bachau and many others all giving excellent support to the filmbr br the film has several main focuses the first is charles childhood  the drowning of his brother george which haunted him for years the glaucoma that blinded him and the strength taught him by his mother  dont bend dont break dont ever be a cripple she eventually sends him to a special school where charles gift of music is discovered the next focus is charles artistic evolution as a nat king colelike singer to his arrangements of gospel music his foray into country music and the unique sound that became ray charles the third focus is charles personal life  his marriage to bea his many affairs his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitationbr br because charles lived a packed 74 years theres a lot skipped though charles was orphaned while in his teens the death of his beloved mother his rock isnt in the film while he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs his nearstarvation as a musician isnt covered at one point he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it but the jar broke he was that down and out bea is shown with him when the state of georgia which banned him adopts georgia on my mind as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes charles back to his native state yet he and bea were divorced in 1977 which isnt mentioned she probably was there however also she wasnt his only wife  he was married once before he met her that marriage isnt covered in the movie were told of one illegitimate child  there were 12 it would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a filmbr br what isnt skipped is his glorious music which seems to go on constantly throughout the film continually reinforcing his genius and artistrybr br charles story is compelling and holds the audiences interest throughout those who scoff at it as a madefortv movie dont give it the credit it deserves taylor hackfords direction gives ray a good pace and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifullybr br as ray jamie foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget hes a comedian playing a part foxx wore prosthetics did his own piano playing and spent a great deal of time with charles preparing for the role he nails him but its not an impersonation  hes a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brothers body a man full of denial about his addiction hating the word junkie and believing hes not hooked and hes in denial about his home life thinking that his wife doesnt know about his various affairs and illegitimate children in the movie child and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on he demands to be paid in 1 bills so they can be counted when he discovers hes a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal he makes his own deal and leaves his jobbr br one doesnt so much marvel at foxxs performance as accept him as ray from the first time he appears on camerabr br this is an excellent biography which like walk the line is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist whether or not youre a ray charles fan ray is something to experience
