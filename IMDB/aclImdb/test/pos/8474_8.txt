i agree that this film was spectacular the way in which jamie foxx captured not only the impression of ray charles but the essence of ray charles really made the film his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie manouse from innerviews on kuht houston channel 8 the link is http videogooglecom videoplaydocid3001837218936089620q innerviews jamiefoxxhlen  i encourage everyone to check it out as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles the only problem i might cite with the film is that the shotting style was rather bland at times but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person ray charles rather than the film ray
