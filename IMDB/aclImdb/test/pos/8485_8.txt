lets not beat about the bush here taylor hackfords undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than jamie foxxs exceptional careermaking performance remember the year they handed the special effects oscar to the terminator 2 boffins uncontested they should do the same with this years best actor gongbr br that ray charles story is worthy of filming is not in dispute indeed the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are wellhandled and judiciously used but for a life so unique the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar it follows the history of a flawed genius template almost to the letter hardship and exploitation women and drugs recording wrangles band squabbles rehab yeah yeah yeah and surely there was more humour in his life than were treated to herebr br i appreciate charles music yet where neatlycut medleys would have kept the story rolling hackford indulges himself with nearfulllength renditions of too many songs  in gin joints in the recording studio in concert halls infinitum narratively and for nondevotees they begin to act like a cinematic brake this may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as rays we need a taste not the whole dish otherwise wed buy the albumsbr br intrigued as i was i glanced at my watch more than once so for all foxxs brilliance maybe ray would have been better served as an hbo twoparter
