i saw ray when it first came out why partly because of the advertising hype secondly because i just loved the heck outa ray charless music but not being around when his biggest things in music and his life happened i wanted to learn more about the mans life and in this film i did his addiction to drugs was something i didnt know and the film let us knowbr br but heres the thing while this was a decent autobiographical filmi cannot say it was a great film ive seen malcolm x and was blown away same with whats love got to do with it and bird the performances of each of those films was outstanding i wasnt just drawn into the main characters in those films  who did incredible jobs  but to those around them as well that helps make a picture to mebr br i felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal and yes ill admit at certain parts of the film i almost fell asleep and the film was too long and the film left out several other important details of ray charles life that would have made the film flow better the film got choppy to me in certain parts and the film seemed to end with a whimper not a bang  certain parts including the ending played like a tacked on lifetime cable network movie to me i expect more outa cinemabr br so  where does my ambivalence come in with jamie foxxs performance overall he did  okay not denzel washingtons malcolm x or angela bassetts tina turners spectacular butokaybr br sorry folks but to me there were several points in the film where i saw jamie foxxs interpretation of ray charles and in others  thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting  he looked like ray charles but i paid attention to the  acting an actor has to make you believe he is the character he is playing not make a caricature of the character did i believe jamie foxx was ray on the screen sometimes yes  sometimes nobr br did jamie foxx deserve a golden globe you betcha does he deserve an oscar depends on whos hes up against hes got a few major competitors there and he might just edge them out but then againmaybe not if jamie foxx doesnt win i will not stand up and say he was robbed i wont particularly feel that he had beenbr br this was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story a great autobiographical film of the late ray charles no somewhere out there i feel there is a great film about ray charles just waiting to be made and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so
