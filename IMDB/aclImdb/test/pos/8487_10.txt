jamie foxx was the epitome of ray charles after a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself ray charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that no one has ever or will ever write play or record music like this musical giant when he passed the flesh the world lost one of its greatest american heroes as far as the movie the fact that jamie foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like ray was an asset to the director what could be better than that you dont have to have a double play piano and then try to split the screen from someone elses hands to jamies face it worked beautifully i loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult ray was he wasnt always a nice man you didnt also root for him he was a drug addict a womanizer and sometimes just plain hardheaded but i guess thats what made him genius so i cant fault him for that i pick jamie for best actor
