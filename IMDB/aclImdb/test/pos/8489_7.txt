ray lives onbr br ray dir taylor hackford cast jamie foxx kerry washington regina king clifton powell curtis armstrong and sharon warren written by taylor hackford and james l white rating br br hit the road jack and dont come backÂ…no more no more no more no more who wouldve thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived over a lovers brawl ray charles was a genius and if there was one thing that he knew breathed and lived for it was music so in a lifetime that comprised acute poverty a desperate struggle with darkness guilt drugs and painful affairs ray still found moments when inspiration hit him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form an instant eternal classic br br there are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen ray charless life was one of them it almost comes as a shock to learn that this project had no studiobacking until it was completed and that backing probably came after the initial screenings where jamie foxxs performance was lauded and predicted as a surefire oscar winner in hushed voices jamie foxx as ray almost convinces us that it is indeed ray charles performing on screen and not an actor impersonating from the crooked allknowing smile to the bent gait of not so much a handicapped but a man dancing through his demons foxx captures every essence of the actual ray charles ray was a complicated man he never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself an astute businessman he ensured his success at any cost sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones he never apologized for his philandering ways and always maintained that he loved his family which we are convinced he did he liked sex it was as simple as that but beneath all there also existed a ray that was afraid of darkness imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of darkness his fear was because of his guilt ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brothers death and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself ray was a maverick who fused gospel with jazz an unheard blasphemous practice in the 50s but his intentions werent to instigate he was simply practicing the only way he knew of getting close to godbr br it is hard to capture such an eventful life as that of ray and that is perhaps where the movie fails we are never really allowed to get close to ray as a person we know him only as much as we see him his relationships especially with margie hendricksregina king arent explored in detail and the script barely passes over della beakerry washington rays wife who everyone knows was a rock by his side and the biggest blunder of all is the rushed almost abrupt climax its as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and called for a packup nonetheless ray is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from jamie foxx and an able stellar ensemble the songs and age create a sense of nostalgia and we get a genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity br br  abhishek bandekarbr br note ray is nominated in six categories at this years academy awards including best picture best director and best actorjamie foxxbr br rating br br  poor  average  good  very good  excellentbr br 19th february 2005
