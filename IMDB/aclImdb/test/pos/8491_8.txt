jamie foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous bluessoulcountry singer ray charles to the films credit it shows both the good and the bad regarding charles character and the choices he made both personally and professionallybr br this is a slicklooking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place not only does it look good it sounds good i only wish there was more music in here when its inserted its fabulous but there isnt enough of it br br assuming at least for review purposes that the story was true i was impressed and disappointed with charles meaning the story left some memorable impressions since im writing this 16 months after viewing it main impressions includebr br good  reliving rays immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically such as going country for awhile the man had supreme confidence in himself but didnt come across as arrogant about it also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction  with no help thats just amazingbr br bad  i also remember through this film how easily hooked ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife a really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kids little league games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her even fathering a child with a member of his singing groupbr br the only negative i had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event the accidental death of his brother that tragedy was used as copout for all rays misdoings as an adult which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actionsbr br note there is an extended version with the dvd but word has it that it is so poorly edited that its not worth watching so stick with the theatrical version
