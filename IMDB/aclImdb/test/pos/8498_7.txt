if someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into ray and asked what i thought of jamie foxx in the title role it would have been time for a blank stare after all what is this fictitious person talking about that wasnt jamie foxx up on the big screen that was ray charles this is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years like the soundtrack jamie as ray is flatout brilliantbr br the blind genius of soul who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with rb died during production the movie about his troubled life is good not great taylor hackfords direction and james l whites script follow the wellworn biopic outline supertalented youngster battles adversity achieves greatness while also selfdestructing then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending the film shows charles flaws heroin abuse chronic womanizing persistent bastardfathering even as it sucks you in with his beautiful musicbr br kerry washington and regina king play the main women in rays life one his longsuffering wife and the other his longtime mistress both actresses match foxx stride for stride what takes him to a different level though is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician the entire cast is effective especially sharon warren as his headstrong mother and curtis armstrong as a music exec hackfords stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies andbetter yetmore starring rolesbr br i was not a ray charles aficionado before ray apparently the film has left out a lot as do all biopics but this picture functions as both an oldfashioned crowd pleaser and a dark investigation of a brillianttroubled man for those who whine that foxx doesnt actually sing as if that somehow diminishes his performance take a hike no mere actor can sing like mr charles anyway you cant have everything what the talented star does in this picture is about as close to everything as well probably see for a while
