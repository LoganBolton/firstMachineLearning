my wife wanted to see this movie and i grudgingly went along i have never been a big fan of the biopic  believing that cinema is more exciting when it isnt structured in nonfiction beyond that although i like ray charles music just fine i dont consider myself a fan of him or his musicbr br i expected to either suffer or coast through this moviebr br i was wrongbr br this is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style the realism is in the nuances  the tilt of a characters head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing i literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing itbr br jaime foxx of which much has been said heads a cast of immaculate recreators of not just a time but an era a life that never really existed to those of us under forty this movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of titanic or other period pieces of that ilk this movie doesnt present you with the 50s and 60s music scene it takes you therebr br this is a movie about ray charles but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life this is the kind of movie like saving private ryan or schindlers list that does what a movie should do  bring you to another place another time
