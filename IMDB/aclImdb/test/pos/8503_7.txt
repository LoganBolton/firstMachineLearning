so dark the night poses a tough challenge its very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who havent yet seen it since it remains quite obscure that includes just about everybody the movie will strike those familiar with its director joseph h lewis better known titles in the noir cycle  gun crazy the big combo even my name is julia ross which in its brevity it resembles  as an odd choicebr br for starters the bucolic french countryside serves as its setting steven geray a middleaged detective with the surété in paris sets out for a vacation in the village of ste margot or maybe margaux quite unexpectedly he finds himself falling in love with the inkeepers daughter micheline cheirel even though shes betrothed to a roughhewn local farmer but the siren song of life in paris is hard to resist so she agrees to marry him despite the disparity in their ages which inevitably becomes the talk of the town br br but on the night of their engagement party she fails to return to the inn soon a hunchback finds her body by the river her jealous jilted lover is the logical suspect but he too is found dead then anonymous notes threaten more deaths which come to pass for the first time in his career the bereaved geray finds himself stumpedbr br a particularly weak script all but does the movie in it plays like bad cornell woolrich crossed with the murder of roger ackroyd but lewis does this creaky vehicle proud he takes his time near the beginning but then the story  and the storytelling  gain momentum alas just about the time the script breaks an axle burnett guffey lighted and photographed the film with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows theres also an effective score by hugo friedhofer who supplied aural menace to many noirs a good deal of talent has been lavished on so dark the night but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick  and not a very good gimmick at that its a onetrick pony of a moviebr br
