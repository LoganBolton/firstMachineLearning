i first saw this one when it was first shown so im not too objective about it it really managed to scare me partly because it was so late at night but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story the same thing that helped dark shadows itself and the casting was so right i hardly know shane briant from anything else so it might not be so right to call him wellcast but to me he is dorian gray and as far as the other male actors the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport whos so good at larger than life characters as sir henry and john karlen a sort of dan curtis repertory player at the time because of dark shadows as one poster points out this version manages to include the involvements with men in a fairly subtle way the scene where dorian recites a list of mens names to john karlens character as a way of blackmailing him and the look on karlens face were very welldone if that scene were done now it would probably be done in a too obvious way and be bad by comparison i saw it when dorian gray was barely a name to me let alone more so even more than the famous 1945 version which is rightly famous this is the version to me
