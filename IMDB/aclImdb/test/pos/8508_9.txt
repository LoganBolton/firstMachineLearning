yes lets get this out of the way before we begin this is the one that sean connery returned to in 1983 after the stint we had of roger moore its connerys last film and yes its a kind of remake of thunderball but more of a film inspired by it if all you bond purists out there think im gonna get controversial youre right bond is one of the greatest movie series ever but that doesnt mean that a series should go on forever this i think is one of two films where they couldve done themselves a huge favour and ended the bond saga not offended yet then ill continue hey if youre thinking im indifferent about bond flicks youre wrong i grew up with my mum being obsessed with them any spare moment bond and his antics would be on the tv bond rules and never say never again directed by irvin empire strikes back kershner is one of the best it may not be goldfinger or from russia and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others which i hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made but still stands head and shoulders above the recent brosnan outings if you havent spat at the screen read on characterization something so many blockbuster films forget about these days but something which is essential to telling a good story never played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since dr no hes getting on a bit and so has to do things like go to a health farm  a direct order from m  yeah if you havent seen this film i wont give too much away with the plot because a loads happens and b obviously i want you to see it for yourselves dont be put off by my old bond revelation connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge swim punch speed smash and snog his way through the man is a legend and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as bond high tech gadgets galore some great villains and an excellent supporting cast including a fantastic cameo by rowan atkinson lift this movie high above audience expectationbr br this couldve been the last bond film ever and it wouldve been a party to remember playing the secret agent as someone nearing retirement was refreshing stroke of genius  the last scene wraps things up perfectly for the series but still we had more and then more and more still and one more moore still if you fancy finding out what fatima blush is all about get this film then you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent in the arms of kim basinger and smirking at mr bean ps  that other film that i think couldve finished it all off the gritty license to kill
