background info  the movies octopussy  never say never again were both made the same year 1983 and so naturally people compare them moore vs connery bond vs bondbr br ive heard many people claiming that the official movie octopussy is far superior well i just watched octopussy bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour impossiblethe wind would blow him off using his feet to force the plane to ground and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour again impossibletry jumping out of your caryoud end up with a shattered body how is that octopussy scene supposed to be good in any sense of the word suddenly bond has superhuman strength  a titanium body and he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56 complete crap unbelievable farsebr br  now lets contrast the above scene with connerys unofficial never say never again it doesnt have the same polish due to its independent film status less money but at least you can believe that connery is a real spy in real dangerbr br the movie starts off with bond showing his age he is 50 after all and being sent off for recuperation entirely believable but of course theres no such thing as a day off for a worldfamous spy and bond quickly finds himself a target even inside the hospital from that point the story spins off into another adventure with bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weaponsbr br as usual sean connery did a brilliant job and avoids the overthetopunbelievable stunts this movie feels like a natural successor to connerys last film 1971s diamonds are forever the old style of bond before the franchise got sillybr br highyly recommended
