yes its sean connery playing bond again looking more alive and into his part than any time since the first time they made this film in 1965 when it was called thunderball but the tongue is so firmly in cheek one wonders if connery isnt employing a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous successor roger moorebr br moore is my favorite bond but connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing the only serious bond film not made under the aegis of the classic eon bond series never say never again is an irreverent return to the well soft on action its nevertheless strong on character and clever dialoguebr br bond its made clear right away is a man in disfavor no matter how many times he has saved the world his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle too many free radicals thats your problemcaused by eating too much red meat white bread too many martinis then i shall cut out the white bread sir bond smartly repliesbr br an early fight sequence in a spa represents the movies high point actionwise with bond and an attacker fighting their way through a kitchen a bedroom and a laboratory before bond finally douses his opponent ironically with no small help from those free radicals humor is liberally applied in the film rather more cleverly than most of moores outings though connery seems to be having more fun sending himself up as a result of moores less egotistic examplebr br was it because he was making a good chunk of the gross or was it working for less stingy producers whatever it is the screenplay serves his laidback style well and the result is richer and more entertaining than connerys prior two eon bond outings you only live twice and diamonds are foreverbr br the 1980s were not a good decade for bond whether it was connery moore or timothy dalton leg warmers video games and ugly sports cars are all in evidence and the bianca jagger sunglasses klaus maria brandauer is seen wearing in his first scene do him no favors forget first impressions brandauers role as the chief villain maximilian largo is one of the best in any bond film with brandauer enjoyably playing up his characters menace and mania at one point he allows bond free roam of his situation room with a martini to boot and his dancing eyes and mad engaging grin make for compelling company throughoutbr br the best thing in this film other than connery are the bond girls shot with more attention to personality than normal in bond films a testament to cinematographer douglas slocombe and director irvin kirshner barbara carrera was nominated for a golden globe for her role as the villainess fatima blush every bit as crazy as largo and even nicer to look at she doesnt last the whole movie you almost need her gone in order to focus on the othersbr br kim basingers breasts and buttocks should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this film but im not complaining basingers a rare beauty who in this early role as largos mistress mixes incredible hotitude with a childlike vulnerability that brings out the bond in me and many others i suspect her lips and cheekbones are pretty sweet toobr br its not a wellconstructed film its a knockoff of a better bond movie with a sloppy storyline a terrible score and a flat ending but it does have connery proving his was the definitive take on cinemas definitive secret agent even if he steals a page or two from my 007 mr moore the end result is entertaining enough so im not complaining
