you dont review james bond movies you evaluate them rate them according to how well they meet expectations there are certain things one has come to expect even demand of a bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesnt so here are ten elements that make a bond film a bond film and even though never say never again is not technically part of the official bond filmography the mere presence of sean connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series anyway heres how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10 br br title never say never again the clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline but is instead an injoke reference to sean connerys vow to never play oo7 again after having been lured back once before for diamonds are forever whatever the case it is a catchy title 8 pointsbr br precredit teaser perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official eon series of bond films there is no teaser the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits and even that is disappointing yet another ohno bond has been killed fakeout 4 pointsbr br opening credits other than a screen full of tiny 007s they didnt even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles 1 pointsbr br theme song as written by michel legrand and sung by lani hall never say never again would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride as a bond theme its merely okay 6 pointsbr br bond james bond appropriately since this film sees connery being lured back into service as bond after a decades hiatus the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether bondconnery is still up to the job happily connery more than proves himself ready for bondage again though he is a bit grayer sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action all in all it is one of connerys best and most relaxed turns as the character 9 pointsbr br bond babes even in the best of the bond films the female characters arent given much dimension they exist largely as necessary props for bonds use future oscarwinner kim basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of domino petachi and the film benefits from this she does a nice job  and shes not bad to look at either 8 pointsbr br bond villain the reports of his death being obviously exaggerated blofeld is back  at least for the moment  showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat onetime jesus portrayerturnedstereotypical villain max von sydow isnt given a lot to do in the role but is a silky presence nonetheless but he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by klaus maria brandauer as maximilian largo after a string of banal bond villains it is so refreshing for brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle yet colorfully evil funny without being campy ruthless without seeming cartoonish his largo ranks right up there with auric goldfinger as one of bonds best villains 10 pointsbr br bond baddies fatima blush what can i say as played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen barbara carrera breezes through the film displaying a mix of selfamused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters but few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination even her untimely demise is spectacular even by bondian standards 10 pointsbr br sinister plot as a remake of sorts of thunderball the film does seem a bit beentheredonethat nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world dont pay a multikazillion dollar ransom but at least producer kevin mcclory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest bond adventures by comparisons this effort blows thunderball out of the water and despite the absence of many bondian trademarks the film succeeds on its own 9 pointsbr br production values the film starts out with an uneasy style like a tv movie trying to be more than it can but as the story progress the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose making it a superior adventure 8 points br br bonus points there are several odd changes that sets this bond film apart from the official series miss moneypenny is hardly acknowledged as played by edward fox m is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the double os a foreshadowing of how judi dench would later play the part and q suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddybuddy with bond and there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film such as replacing bonds astinmartin with a vintage packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story and a big rescue near the end is on horseback an homage to the raiders of the lost ark which was itself a tribute to the bond films 5 pointsbr br summary never say never again is a mixed bag in the really important areas it more than holds it own thanks to hero connery villain brandauer assassin carrera and damselindistress basinger but the devil is in the details as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits theme song and such seem the film is lacking because of their absence it all comes off as a faux bond film a very good substitute but a substitute nonethelessbr br bondometer rating 78 points out of 100
