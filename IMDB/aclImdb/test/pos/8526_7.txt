when i first saw this on tape about 10 years after it had been released i thought it was one of the better james bond movies however after seeing it again around the turn of the century i was disappointedbr br i think its a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see sean connery end his 12year hiatus from playing bond that they didnt dare criticize the film i guess what disappointed me was the ending after investing two hours into the film you expect a lesshokey more satisfying ending and it may be nitpicking but i was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as miss moneypenny q felix leiter etcbr br on the positive side there was plenty of unique action scenes particularly early on and the two villains were interesting i thought klaus maria brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so lowkey and looked the nice guy next door he wasnt your normal bond villainbr br this had plenty of skin for a pg movie especially with kim basinger starring never being an actress known for hiding her figure the language was very tame but most bond movies are pretty good in that departmentbr br all in all its a fair bond and nothing else just because connery is in it it doesnt mean its automatically good roger moore and pierce brosnan have proved they could play the role well too
