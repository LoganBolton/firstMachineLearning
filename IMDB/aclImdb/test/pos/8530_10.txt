well first of all  i am a big fanatic of horror movies but however  i am pretty sick of all those damn american horror movies they are all about the same thing  blood and violence its not even creepy well its nothin wrong with the blood and all that  doesnt even bother me  but thats not what makes a movie creepy thats why i find this movie entertaining  its fun to see a satire which is making fun of the koncept main horror usa american splattergoremovies they are not suppose to be creepy only funny thats ok but when theyre suppose to be creepy it mostly gets pathetic however there are a few great american horror movies poltergeist psycho birds but in the end its all the same thing thats why this movie came as a relief evil ed is not just a cult movie  its a classic i cant wait untill master director anders jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie untill than i have to watch evil ed again  and again  and again but i dont care  it is such an outstanding movie
