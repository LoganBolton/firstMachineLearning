on monday earlier this week sometime in july i happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf and me being a horror fan wanted to see something scary i was thinking of the ammityville horror 2 but i got something way better i was at my friends house and he had the vhs evil ed no cover or anything he didnt even see the whole thing himself but he told me it was about a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people well this movie was very shockingive never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie it buries ted bundy and ed gein both it is pretty funny too with references to the evil dead trilogy and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie the movie is about edward a obsessivecompulsive nice guy who happens to be a film editor he is then lent to another department in the building and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell the splatter and gore department sam campbell eddys new boss is telling eddy about the big break on his movies the gruesome loose limbs series and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe eddy has his regrets soon as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in and then what happens from there is truly nightmarish imagine yourself in his place the acting is great the overdubbing is little funny sam campbells voice is often found funny same with the other actors however the overdubbing job was done pretty good i give this movie a 1010 and its a good introduction to the gore subgenre to horror very good nightmarish bloodyyou just have to see it for yourselfbr br quote from movie where in the fk is my beaver rape scene
