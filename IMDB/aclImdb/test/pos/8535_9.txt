i honestly didnt think at first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects boy was i wrong from the very beginning to the very end the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like evil dead and gremlins this movie could be compared to peter jacksons works of art though this movie isnt as gory as braindead but i sure wait these guysll make another splatter movie
