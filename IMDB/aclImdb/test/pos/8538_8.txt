evil ed is a swedish film about a man named ed of courseand his collapse into total madness after editing a series of b horror films known as the loose limbs series ed becomes so mad that he thinks hes seeing demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people that are close to him such as his wife and daughterbr br i first saw this movie back in 1998 and was baffled by what i had seen to this day this movie i consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there as the movie is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few creepy momentsbr br this is a cool flick but dont expect anything marvelous its simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs 810 stars
