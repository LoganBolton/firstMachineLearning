i first saw this movie in papua new guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since although i have never seen it since that first timebr br just how easily good peoples lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me foreverbr br the movie is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by anthony quinn is superbbr br this movie should be in all college studies about mans inhumanity to man
