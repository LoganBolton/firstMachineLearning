i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important reallife lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe todaybr br if you thought ethnic cleansing as its called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity youll think differently after viewing this storybr br i guess id been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil doesbr br this movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to eg church groups or civil rights organizationsbr br i dont expect it will be too easy to find and rent but id really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinns character came from  and where his ancestors came from well come to find out that quinns character isnt a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary hes a perfect archtypical aryan which doesnt mean a whole lot to quinns character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah its a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine coversbr br
