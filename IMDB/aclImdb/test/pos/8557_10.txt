we dont know why this extraordinary film was never made available officially on dvd anthony quinns performance alone makes this a mustsee there are relatively few films in which an actor identifies so profoundly with his character a phenomenon always unique for us moviegoersbr br but quinns powerful portrayal of an innocent romanian literally dragged out of his house and everyday life by forces he cannot comprehend is only part of what makes this film great the script is based on a book published in paris by a romanian priest who fled the communist takeover of his country and the film succeeds to go deep into a little known area of easteuropean history told as a succession of kafkaesquire twists of fate the misadventures of johann moritz told openly and honestly without any of the political correctness currently so precious in hollywood are in fact a eulogy for the lost innocence of the romanian people it is devilishly ironic that this eulogy is signed by a french director working with the american money of an italian producer and overseeing a multinational cast fronted by an extraordinary mexicanborn thespianbr br ive seen mentions of vcds of this film in various asian internet stores and i was fortunate to take possession of a digital recording of this film broadcast on the british version of tcm but its a shame that the 25th hour isnt anywhere on the future dvd release map of mgm studios
