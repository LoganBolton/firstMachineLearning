i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager and again in college i thought it was funny and there are boobs everywhere it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made from rrated films like porkys to softcore au pair girls its a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity the thing that made hots great was that like the previous two films its a hell of a lot of fun hots is like a girlpower version of animal house with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam on a side note whoever designed the hooters girls outfits must certainly have seen this film
