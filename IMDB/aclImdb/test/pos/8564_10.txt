i gave this a 10 because its the best film of its kinda good oldfashioned t  a film in the shadow and spirit of animal house i saw this with a similar film called swap meet and both were good of their typea great way to spend a saturday afternoon lets be honestthere are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an rrated movie from beginning to end they just seem to keep showing up on screen sunbathing scenes bedroom scenes and of course the climactic football game also a memorable kissing booth kiss me clutz everybody seems to be having a good time in their roles several playboy playmates danny bonaduce several familiar tv and movie actors etc the only complaint i have to register is that lisa londons character is called by her last name ohara and not a good 1970s name like olivia or even ora or ona or o i saw this again in the late 1980s with my now exwife pretty well endowed herself and she couldnt believe i was actually enjoying the movie she was probably jealous again this movie is a great way to spend a saturday afternoonjust dont think too hard
