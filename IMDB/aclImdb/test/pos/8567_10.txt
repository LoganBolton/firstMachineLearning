hots is proof that at one time the movie industry said foff to the censors and made movies with whatever they wanted in todays world this movie would be too over the top and extreme for it to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain although bestbuy had several copies on their 599 rack in case anyone wanted to get a copy the movie was brilliant in its own way in that it blended humor into a ta movie loaded with playboy playmates unlike most skin flicks it did have a plot that however is not exactly why you would watch hotsbr br hots is a college movie that reminds me of the revenge of the nerds movies in that it takes a group of average people and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people cant stand the only difference is that the nerds in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid i notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low and to me that is ignorant obviously this is not intended to win oscars or break barriers in film if you are looking for that then go watch what ever the critics pick for you you have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot decent acting for the most part given the genre and plenty of girls getting naked hots is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress and instead laugh and have a good time if you are looking for a funny collegebased movie that has enough skin to turn a pink miata straight then you should really check out hots
