i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drivein theatre here in toronto its about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college so they start up their own and of course call it hots its a fun movie that is just bursting with drivein nostalgia lots of fully endowed tshirts vans fighting and a football game showdown like no other its been compared to animal house which is a good movie in its own right but to me nothing compares to hots it has its own brand of fun  character if you are looking for a classic t na movie look no further because the hots girls are to the rescue boomboom shorts  all
