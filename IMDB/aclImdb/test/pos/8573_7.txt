if you watched this film for the nudity as i did you wont be disappointed i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was i think hots has to be the best of its genrebr br it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these timesbr br i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any daybr br it is a shame that the dvd doesnt have any extras but as they didnt have dvds when this was filmed that is understandable i would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end
