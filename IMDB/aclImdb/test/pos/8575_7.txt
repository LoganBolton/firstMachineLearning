i wanted to love this movie everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable if not groundbreaking film it was set in southern france goodlooking and recognizable actors led the cast and i really admired the vibrant african costumes the proverbs and music despite all this i didnt love it movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing but secret laughter doesnt do that nimi and matthew as played by long and firth both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish i used dried fish deliberately because it was one of a few  too few  strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film another winner was when nimi catches matthew snooping around her apartment he finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says your name is nimi i never knew then he insists that she call him by his christian name i watched this scene intently as matthew asked nimi over and over to say my name realizing that up until that moment they always called each other by their last names i thought this was a turning point for the film and expected that it get better it didnt why do nimi and matthew always seem to stand at ten paces even in that say my name scene what does matthew like about nimi aside from her obvious beauty and why would a sensible woman like nimi fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic adventure comes along and id like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery yes jenny is a vicious harpy but if i were in her shoes but id probably match her cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying believe it the story hints at nimis painful past but never fully explores it some critics say firth seemed a little awkward here and i agree for goodness sake the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19thcentury snob mr darcy and while wearing those hideous britches as for long who did shine in love jones there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character even so there were many moments  the say my name scene among them  when she was in total control and came across really well yet secret laughter is not without its redeeming qualities and ive found that it grew on me with more viewings nene was well portrayed as supportive and wellmeaning even if she doesnt fully understand nimis attraction to matthew i absolutely loved it when nene faced off with mama fola in those dueling proverbs scenes my husband liked it and usually hes the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesnt like what is going on he even chuckled at the scene when sammy asked matthew some very frank questions about sex so there you have it secret laughter was good enough to entertain an avowed curmudgeon like my hubby but an avid moviegoer like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey
