personally i think the movie is pretty good it almost rates an 8 i liked the ethnography aspect as well as the gorgeous photography colin firths character isnt the most likable but he does a better than decent job with the role the heroine played by the beautiful nia long is a familiar film heroine in that shes trying to do what she thinks is the best for her child  marrying a respected member of her expatriate community  while fighting her attraction for the bad man  one whos not a member of her community the outsider most of the film is about this mothers struggle should she do whats expected of her what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart i dont want to give away the ending let me just say that its a feelgood movie with gorgeous location shots exquisite african dress its worth seeing the film just for the womens brilliantly colored african clothing and headdresses and likable characters overall the actor who plays nia longs son is bright and adorable the plot is a bit formulaic but i liked the movie nonetheless if youre a colin firth fan you must see this film if you like chic flicks see it i think ill watch it again tonight
