i caught this movie on local tv at about 430 am i didnt have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something goodbr br there are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key factorbr br the whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main characterbr br your subconscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinionbr br the technical aspects are very good really good in fact kelly overtone is extremely sexy and shes candy for the eye although shes most of the time in her white clothesbr br the fear factor is almost inexistent but theres plenty of mystery and tension to dig frombr br i would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers
