ive seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with itbr br the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually isbr br although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandablebr br luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understandbr br i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
