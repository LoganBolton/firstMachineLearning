a fabulous filmwhich i have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days agoyes i am a colin firth fan and colin was his usual talented natural gorgeous selfbr br the interaction between colin matthew fieldand fissysammy nimis 7 year old son was very special and so natural to watch they were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings the scenes which i loved the most was sammy and matt sitting on the wall chatting and matt then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion i wont reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot also very hilarious was sammy quizzing matt about sex colin and fissy were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural colins words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all just brilliant credit of course must also go to fissy roberts for his delightful portrayal of sammy he played such a lovable and cheeky child character the two actors were just perfect togetherbr br the interaction between colin matt and nia nimiwas perfectly balanced and i couldnt agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch displaying lovetension and of course passion it was exciting to see how their delicate blossoming romance gradually unfolded also showing how their cultural and social divides affected their relationship and was good to see how colin and nia sensitively portrayed matt and nimi discovering accepting and overcoming these differences it kept me fixed to the tv and guessing right until the end of the film br br colins portrayal of matts vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed so much so that i found it was difficult to watch when matt was so mean and childish towards sammy because he matt felt that sammy was getting in the way of his romancerelationship with sams mother nimione couldnt help feeling very disappointed angry and frustrated with matt for treating sammy this way and this in turn threatening to spoil matts special relationship with sammy and nimi colins special talent of getting inside a characters head and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch i must also mention that colin also has such a good rapport with young actors see also my life so fara wonderful and not to be missed filmbr br i also loved the relationship between matthew and his wife jenny both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly happy marriages are quite what they may seem from the outside br br i mustnt forget to mention the reverend whom i thought was very funny in a serious sort of way also nimis mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of nimis culture and her situationbr br the downside i cant really find a downsidebut to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review the only negative comment that i would make is that the script writers didnt explain in enough detail as to why matt collapsed in the car there was only a vague suggestion from nimi of something being wrong with his heart however this didnt detract from my enjoyment of the film far from iti just needed to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd takebr br i felt that this film had it all entertaining uplifting and i loved the rich colours and sunny scenerythe film warmed up a cold winters day and made me smile  all the essential elements were therelaughterlovetensionsadnessangerdrama and a warm feel good factor with yes plenty of those delicious colin firth moments including a very soaked colin in a wet shirt scenenot to be missed by any fan what more could a girl want br br i would strongly recommend this film specially to any colin firth fans
