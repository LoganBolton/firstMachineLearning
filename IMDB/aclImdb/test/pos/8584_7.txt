i suspect theres some revisionist history going on herebut one definitely comes away with the feeling that patrice lumumba was a troublemaker who incited his people to violence from the moment the congo declared independencehis inability to control his people and his decision to bring in soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the united states involved and led to his assassinationhoweverby replacing him with mobututhe united states didnt solve anythingthey made the situation just as badwellacted with excellent cinematography and a rousing scoredefinitely worth seeing
