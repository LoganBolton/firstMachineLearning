good movie acting was terrific especially from eriq ebouaneylumumbaand very well directedbr br it also shows how lumumba was cornered by the belgians u s a and united nations and how they labelled him a communist to scare people as they did to all the honest true african leaders like nkrumah kenyatta nyerere and many others it shows how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds it is a story of injustice struggle and brutalitybr br it shows how lumumba couldnt control his people yes they were his people but before we put the blame on him was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like mobutu or his colleague had other things in their minds to find out go and see the movie certainly mobutu did went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs before he was overthrown and fled the country died a billionairebr br some flaws there was too little explanation how the man lumumba got to rise in the first place also there should have been more explanation about the country congo kinshasa after independence now known as democratic republic of congo formerly known as zaire when it was under mobutu there should have been an explanation why he lumumba couldnt keep the second largest country in africa in one piece and also what was going on with tshombe and katanga  just heads up if you gonna watch the movie tshombe was controlling the katanga region which if i am not mistaken is the number one copper producer in the worldbr br in all it is a good movie to see you will learn something new about africa its leaders and its people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars
