why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film it isnt a masterpiece but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather phillip stone and brian whatshisname on nbc a mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally but fails miserably in his personal life i worked for eight 8 years in network news and robin stones do existbr br the supporting cast works for me from cannon who can be annoying but isnt in this film to greene who plays pathos just right to wexler who scores as the young model in love w the image of prince charming and cant reconcile that image w the true ugliness inside also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a copout its not listen to the song hes moving on for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues he realizes the answers dont lay w the life hes lived and the symbolic walk away from those hes associated himself with at the end is perfect
