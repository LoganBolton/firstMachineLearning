black rain is a superb film but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as 300 apiece i have the dvd and its terrible very tiny nonanamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolutionkilling size acceptable sound this is a primitive dvd that absolutely has to be rereleasedbr br btw i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them allÂ—subtitles in the black sharp big picture simple but very good soundtrack buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding
