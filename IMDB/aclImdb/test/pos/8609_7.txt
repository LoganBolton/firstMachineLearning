pretty darn good for a french film i have not seen any of catherine breillats previous films and so have no opinions about this compared to her previous work french cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films and leaves the shootemups and star vehicles to hollywood that is probably a good business strategy as no other nations film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects films about filmmaking are often a bore as it has little resonance for people not in the business but this one held my interest much more than i thought it would in spite of the title oddly in english it really isnt much of a comedy in spite of a few droll moments ive only seen a few of anne parillauds films but she shows a generous amount of talent and range from the actionpsychological drama of la femme nikita to the wry comedy of innocent blood this film also extends her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman yet is still compelling on the screen kudos also to roxane mesquida with whom i was unfamiliar she plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film whose talent is drawn out at the end if you dont have to have car chases and explosions to be entertained check this one out
