i wasnt surprised to read a comment by the director to the effect that she made this film as an antidote to all those making of dvd featurettes as that certainly struck me i do confess that i have a penchant for meta but i found this film to be very accessible and entertaining and not even in a labored selfconsciously clever way which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a film about filmmaking it is very french in that there are a great deal of outlandish yet occasionally compelling theories about how filmmaking and even sexuality works but since the director doesnt quite play herself using an avatar instead were left with a lot of choices since im pretty sure shes constantly contradicting herself apparently catherine breillat specializes in hardtowatch films but id definitely say this one doesnt qualify i really enjoyed the dialog the balance between the cinematic and the natural the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor and so on highly recommended
