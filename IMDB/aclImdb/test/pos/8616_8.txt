i like breillats movies but this one is the best ive seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence anne parillaud is electric and the script is amazing  especially considering its supposed to take place on the set of another of breillats movies you dont have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power try to imagine a male director with jeannes openness  not impossible but a little mindbending the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here but not a cold light
