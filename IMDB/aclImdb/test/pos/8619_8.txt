another fabulous movie from catherine breillat this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie using comedy  a new genre for breillat  we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style the character who plays the director in the movie is based on breillat the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film a ma soeur as is the main teenage actress but the film like all of breillats work is not entertainment alone it is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to purity as opposed to pornography that is a cornerstone of breillats work and a devotion to real emotion we see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them hypnotising them into the parts they need to play bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them she makes meaningful movies not titillation but she shows the work that is needed to produce this and so gives us insights both into the decidedly french film making process and the psychology of male  female sexuality
