it is very hard to come up with new information about jfk jr and this fine movie had very little of it but it was a joy to watch the casting was very good and the script while somewhat like a documentary was also good my only complaint was that it wasnt long enough perhaps a twopart movie could have told us more about his pregeorge days and his relationships with his mother sister and other relatives some of the material in the book american son by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot wtbs should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie
