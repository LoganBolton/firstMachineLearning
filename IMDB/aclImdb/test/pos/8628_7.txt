for us an abbott and costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for im very happy i recorded this  my wife remembered it from when she was young but i had never seen it the family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selectedbr br our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us  always complaining in the beginning but most often coming around she mostly ignored this in the beginning preferring to check her email but she started enjoying herself  many times laughing out loud to the zaninessbr br its wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a 55yr old the monocolour introduction that blends into the fullcolour fairy tale its a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with that includes a little song and a little dance along with everything you expect lou and bud to deliverybr br watch it with your children and have a very fun evening
