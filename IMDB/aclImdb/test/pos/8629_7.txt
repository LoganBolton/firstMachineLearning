so i guess that bud and lou just liked to mess with classic stories although they did have some interesting results in this case theyre babysitting a bad boy and lou tries to read him jack and the beanstalk but falls asleep and dreams that hes jack and buds the butcher and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant buddy baerbr br i think that my favorite scene was when lou was trying to make the giant an omelet andwell ill let you see what happens as this was an abbott and costello movie they did have a few unnecessary songs but other than that it was pretty funny for other interpretations of the classic story bewitched and gilligans island both had episodes portraying it
