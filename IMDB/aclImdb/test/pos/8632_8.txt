abbott and costellos talents shine in the happily childish version of jack and the beanstalk the use of sepia tone and colour the music and choreography song and dance the crossing over of players from one role to another plus various other aspects of this very fine movie make it obvious that techniques and styles used for the wizard of oz are being toyed with here and that works right well for our intrepid duo there are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me  buddy baers max baer jr of the beverly hillbillies uncle appearance as the cop and the giant pat costello lous brother having been involved in the writing of the script these things help make this film fun it does however have its down side i do think that the choreography is poorly done but the cute tunes and accompanying vocals help detract from the rather sloppy dance numbers some of the players the couple in love  prince and princess  to be precise arent very good at their trade but these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise throughly enjoyable walk down the yellow brick  er i mean  climb up the beanstalk
