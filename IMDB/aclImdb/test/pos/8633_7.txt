having read so much negative press on this movie over the years id always avoided it but the advent of the cheap public domain dvd encouraged me to finally give it a viewing br br unfortunately its been transferred from a poor copy the modern prequel shot on tinted stock is blurry and the contrast nonexistent faces are occasionally difficult to make out having said that the actual story is entertaining and lou comes across as an accomplished actor more so than in many of the boys moviesbr br once the movie switches to the jack story the film switches to colour and i use that term loosely most hues are orange or brown the greens look particularly badbr br dorothy ford as polly the giants maid was a big plus for me as i enjoyed her in an early andy hardy appearancebr br with so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print im still happy to give this movie a 7 it gave me a lot of laughs and thats more than the greater majority of comedies ive watched over the decades can managebr br one to watch if you get the chance
