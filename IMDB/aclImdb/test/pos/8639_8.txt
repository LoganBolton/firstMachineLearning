wow what a strange film its a david lynch movie so its no surprise that it is weird br br i defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film i cant be done after some research following my second viewing of this film i pretty much know most of the story but on a first look and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help it is hard to figure things out so if youre in that boat and was confused dont feel bad thats normal let me just say the key to the film is naomi watts characterbr br at any rate i find the film fascinating i love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch the camerawork is excellent and the music is creepy a la lynchs blue velvet there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes in all its very well scoredbr br like lynchs twin peaks television series this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since lynch thought this film was going to be a long drawnout tv series when that didnt happen he pieced at the last minute this ending that may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappearbr br the theme of the story supposedly is a negative comment about hollywood and what it does to people especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushedbr br both watts and the other leading lady laura eleana harring are very interesting to watch especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene looks wise both women were chameleons looking average at times stunning at other timesbr br i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first its not just a curiosity piece its a very intriguing moviejust dont feel stupid if you cant make sense of a few things
