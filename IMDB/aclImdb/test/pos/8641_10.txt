spoiler alert  although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explainbr br mulholland drive is by far the most successful expression of david lynchs cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his twin peaks tv series as lynch enthusiasts know his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir horror movies surrealism and parapsychology  with a healthy dose of postmodern selfconsciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure all these elements are richly at work in mulholland drive making for a riveting hairraising and highly satisfying film experience  especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical mysteryunraveling wholebr br the film features wonderful performances by naomi watts and laura harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality retro 50s nostalgia and satirical selfaggrandizement their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the films opening scene in which harrings character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous not to mention horrific automobile accident staggering down the hillside from mulholland drive to sunset boulevard the two most archetypal of hollywood thoroughfares she finds her way to the very apartment that betty naomi watts is about to sublet from her aunt ruth a purportedly successful actress who is off to canada to begin a new movie as we later learn betty had herself arrived from deep river ontario shortly after winning a jitterbug contestbr br a highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two precredit prologue sequences that frame bettys descent from the clichéd wouldbestarlets brighteyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bitpart actress unable to remember her own name the harring character adopts the name rita from a movie poster for the film noir classic gilda that adorns aunt ruths apartment actually it turns out aunt ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment were really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings anyway betty determines to help rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in ritas purse the two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to ritas true identity they also by the way become lovers at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that i cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of lesbian lover affairs if a lynch movie can ever be designated mainstreambr br at the local winkies restaurant a recurring location fraught with dreamlike significance behind its grubby realistic facade ritas attention is caught by a waitresss nametag reading diane this leads her to a recollection of someone named diane selwyn whose apartment the two women soon visit and at bettys insistence break into i wont reveal what they find within but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage lynchian creepiness subsequently rita wakes in night sweats speaking spanish and hurrying betty to an allnight magic showtheater called silencio where the arts of illusion and lipinstrumental syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the blue haired lady as she is noted in the end credits reigns as the presiding muse framed by the bluelit redcurtained silencio theatre the bluehaired lady occupies the last shot in the film perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like stevens man with the blue guitar as filtered through bad drug surrealismbr br during the silencio sequence and as rebekah del rio cameo lipsyncs her own powerful spanish rendition of roy orbisons crying a shattering epiphany occurs when betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in ritas purse even if we do not delve too deeply into the freudian sexual symbolism of purses the moment is a singularly hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings not the least of these reversals is the discovery that betty is the soughtfor diane selwyn and the spurned lover of camilla rhodes ie rita camilla in turn is a latin femme fatale movie star to whom diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and more significantly to whom she is emotionally subjugatedbr br after these and other discoveries in the last third of the film the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in vertigo while bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much if not all of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of diane herself other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from twin peaks including michael j anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a bob variant who hangs out behind winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its idlike associationsbr br however one fits the pieces together though the whole of mulholland drive is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive provocative and pleasurably disturbing mind trip whats more the films cinematography is stunning the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics the acting superb and the directing editing masterful this may well have been the unacknowledged best picture of 2001 among major american releases
