after two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film we see a darkhaired obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine her driver stops at an odd location on mulholland drive which is a twisting thickly wooded twolane road full of mansions overlooking los angeles just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo only the darkhaired woman survives she works her way down the ridge to sunset boulevard and hides in a vacationing womans apartment shortly after betty naomi watts the vacationing womans niece shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman who now has amnesia the bulk of the first part of the film is betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse this is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about hollywood producers and directors with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutesbr br the above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed but thats not the half of it the film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation its basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around even if you have a lot of experience with likeminded filmssuch as memento 2000 donnie darko 2001 the i inside 2003 and the butterfly effect 2004you may not understand it on a second viewing either the studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director david lynch write 10 clues to unlocking this thriller and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the dvd lynch being of a particular disposition these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself it doesnt help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex it takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be real and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections with only contextual clues that theyre flashbacksbr br but is the film worth watching or worth trying to figure out that depends on your tastes obviously on a surface level the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers but those qualities and many other surrealist aspects of the film are typical of lynch a prime lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if theyre alien pod people trying to put on a front if youre familiar with that style and like it youll find much to love here although in many ways mulholland drive is fairly understated for lynch its also worth noting for viewers wholl primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects that mulholland drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene its not gratuitous although i have no problems with gratuitousness but is instead an important hinge in the filmbr br like all of lynchs films its easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail any serious student of film including armchair studentscinephiles should study mulholland drive many will love it lynch doesnt let anything pass unmanipulated he includes brilliant color schemes such as the plethora of reds and pinks with important symbolism he makes unusual use of sound such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it when betty first arrives at the airport he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways such as his characteristic odd pauses he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through such as the name winkies and the hot dogsmade for pinks sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolismbr br lynchs attention to detail in production design provides important subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning its interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusualthere are no chapters on the disc you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular pointsbr br if the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you or if youre just fond of puzzles then mulholland drive is well worth watching for that aspect there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film at least on a broad generalized level i wont recount the standard interpretation hereit is worth researching but only after youve seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations there are even websites dedicated to itbr br for my money however although i generally love lynch and find many things about mulholland drive attractive it is not quite a 10 for me at least not yet i have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings to me though the twist aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as the i inside and the butterfly effect mulholland drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches but the plot doesnt carry them as well as some of lynchs other filmsbr br still mulholland drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd if youre serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch as if those two would not necessarily coincide you shouldnt miss this one
