theres a sign on the lost highway that saysbr br major spoilers aheadbr br but you already knew that didnt youbr br since theres a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie id like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense as others have pointed out one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient if you have the dvd of md you can cheat by looking at david lynchs top 10 hints to unlocking md but only upon second or third viewing please br br first of all mulholland drive is downright brilliant a masterpiece this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate but vogues it gets inside your head and stays there really hit the markbr br david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it  cinematographywise has great acting esp naomi watts a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti and a very dreamlike quality to it  but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before after all when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldnt leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about regardless of whether they liked it or hated itbr br allright enough about all that its time to justify those statementsbr br most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusiona dream sequencebr br of course thats too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again br br md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn a wannabeactor who is hopelessly in love with another actor camilla rowles due to dianes lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents expectations upon realizing that camilla will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam kesher the director she hires a hitman to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it producesbr br the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some 50s dancejitterbug contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and applauding herbr br no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it theres actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits  the camera moving into an object although blurry and the scene quickly fading out if you look closely the object is actually a pillow revealing that what follows is a dreambr br the main characters seen in the first half of the moviebr br betty diane selwyns imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dreamsequence  a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane betty was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies notice that in the dream version the waitresses name is dianebr br rita the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that through dianes dream and with the help of an imaginary caraccident is turned into an amnesiac this makes her vulnerable and dependent on dianes love she is then conveniently placed in bettydianes aunts luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay inbr br coco in real life adams mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in shes mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the filmbr br adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for bettydiane since she develops such hatred towards himbr br aunt ruth dianes real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camillas murderbr br mr roach a typical lynchian character not real appears only in dianes dream sequence hes a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwardstalking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaksbr br the hitman the person that murders camilla this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that belowbr br now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out chronologically but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to lynch hintsheetbr br as i mentioned above camilla was reproduced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a caraccident in the first 10 minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with md is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isnt ive already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow but notice how theres two cars riding in each lane approaching the limobr br only one of the cars actually hit the limo what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldnt they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences lingers over what it finds fascinating dismisses unpromising plotlinesbr br shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruths apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what were seeing is a nightmarebr br although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think theyre actually her parents since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest perhaps she didnt know them all that well and didnt really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and dianes sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her lifebr br a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camillas part in the movie from adams party in the second half of the movie and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminalbr br this scene i think is also lynchs attempt at totally screwing his audience over since theyre given a false pretence in which to view the moviebr br gotta love that something just bit me bad line though br br the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that theyre sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scenebr br when reaching the corner a bumlike character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in dianes mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her obessions translate into that poor guys nightmares the bum also signifies dianes evil side as can be witnessed later in the moviebr br the cowboy constitutes along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape  diane only saw him for a short while at adams party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what were seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etcbr br the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times indicating to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicidebr br the espressoscene with the castigliane brothers where we can see badalamenti the composer as luigi is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adams party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynchbr br during the scene in which they enter dianes apartment the body lying in the bed is camilla but notice how shes assumed dianes sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness since diane did not know where or when the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off she just put her into her own homebr br in real life dianes audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition  leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performancebr br also interesting is the fact that the money that in reallife was used to pay for camillas murder now appears in ritacamillas purse this is part of dianes undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasnt taken placebr br when her neighbor arrives to get her pianoshaped ashtray another hint is given she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that bettys encounter with the neighbor was a fantasybr br the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camillas photo resumebr br the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed theres much symbolism going on here the box may represent dianes future its empty or it may be a sort of a pandoras box the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open either way it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bumbr br club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what she is viewing is not real it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from even in her dreamsbr br during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fearsbr br anyway that is my 002 hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it the worst movie ever or something to that effect without realizing the plotbr br as usual lynch is all about creating irrational fears and he certainly achieves that with this picture as wellbr br 10 out of 10
