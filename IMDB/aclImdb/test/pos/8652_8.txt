a very interesting addition to the scandavian surrealistic collection recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated my interpretation of the strange ending would be that andreas journey ends in hell he dislikes the bland consumerled emptiness of purgatory a sort of living but not progressing ie not getting anywhere  even the citys metro trains dont stop at the stations it has a metro system like you should be able to travel freedom escape but you can never actually board those trains he is unable to reach fragrant sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination the old norse version of hell hades not hell the terrestrial city isnt burning hot like the british version its cold freezing the land of niflheim land of cold and mists this appears to be where andreas end up having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel
