the bothersome man is one of the best foreign films i have ever seen all the technical aspects are in my opinion perfect lighting acting directing pacing etc the story is breathtakingbr br seemingly beyond death our main character finds himself inhabiting a world without beauty passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses his work is cold and uninteresting his relationships are numb and uninspiring and when it all becomes too much he seeks to end it in front of a train but it doesnt end  he can not leave this strange world by suicide working his way back to a man who seemed to be feeling he same isolation and loneliness our main character joins him in excavating a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music just as they break through  and i will not reveal that much it all comes to an end and the movie ends as oddly as it beganbr br suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it i feel that it is like a magical poem  open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next if you enjoy new experiences in film and want to be taken away from hollywoods crapfeast try this moviebr br 910 and i dont rate easily because in spite of its darkness this movie left me with a sense of something greatersomething mysterious and beyond ourselves well done
