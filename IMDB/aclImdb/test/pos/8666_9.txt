where the heck is andreastrond fausa aurvaag exactly heaven hell a parallel universe when the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train his next conscious moment occurs on a bus riding solo the newest arrival in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere andreas is greeted by an official man who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city if the eyeballs work is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited if memory serves him right andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance a man estranged from people and objects struggling to find his bearings at home or rather his assigned apartment or at work where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor havardjohannes joner his boss tells him youll get used to it which covers more than just crunching numbers we suspect in this world same as the old worldbr br if life is meaningless like french existentialist philosopher jeanpaul satre said the same can be said for death as well the subculture of office life might be heaven for one man but it looks like hell to us under the context that den brysomme mannen operates on to work in the afterlife in essence is to work for the rest of your life the social intercourse among andreas office mates may pass as normal in the physical world but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer as heshe now recognizes the drudgery of whitecollar labor performed by whitecollar laborers who kill the hours with their inconsequential smalltalk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons each and every day seem irrational in its selfevident absurdity to see daily life replicated in a speculative light den brysomme mannen makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy as quotidian life becomes a performance which transforms karl marxs meaning of the word alienation because here the men and women in the office do identify with their labor like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real but the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade hes always aware of the cracksbr br from a wooden bench andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk andreas faces the same impassivity from his own coworkers after he purposely cuts off his own finger with the hope that hell feel the pain on a paper slicer he doesnt its just another sensation in addition to being able to taste and smell thats lost to the bothersome man this inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures amplifies the bothersome mans need for lovewhere simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world at a dinner party hosted by his boss andreas meets anne brittpetonella barker they hit it off he walks her home she invites him in they become a couple he moves in when they have sex however its good for neither andreas nor anne who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design love is an abstract concept another sensation thats unattainable in this world but love matters to the bothersome man so he tries again with ingeborgbirgette lagen a girl from work den brysomme mannen deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman when ingeborg doesnt elicit the same tender feelings for andreas after his hyperromantic gesture of leaving anne britt for her this norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic but odd city with an openendedness thats solvable and offer up multiple interpretationsbr br wounded by ingeborgs apathy towards his avowal of love for her the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station stands at the same platform leers at the same couple aggressively making out and jumps this time he cant die how can you die when youre already dead hit repeatedly by train after train andreas face turns into ground beef his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art when the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp he seeks out the man from the club who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead which is death not life has no meaningbr br getting to the bottom of the mystery behind andreas whereabouts drives the narrative and to the filmmakers credit this enigma is satisfactorily addressed in a scene that recalls spike jonzes being john malkovich when andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world like a newborn baby which resembles the portal to malkovichs brain that craig schwartz charges people to crawl through andreas attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that heaven is a place on earth but at the same time heaven is proved by the reality of a hell the place that andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination
