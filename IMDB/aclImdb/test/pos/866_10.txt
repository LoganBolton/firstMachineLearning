i honestly dont know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review as a result im having a hard time describing these shorts lets just say theres a good amount of gay sex some necrophilia some incest a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial members and i loved every minute of itbr br not that its all crude humor it isnt they stray away from fart gags for the most part with the exception of one sketch entitled pizza in which they use one very well they being 311ths of the shortlived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state namely david wain michael showalter and michael ian blackbr br the trio go on adventures usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people people that are often actually more normal than they are the supporting cast is fantastic as well paul rudd julie bowen bradley cooper zach galifianakis and sam rockwell all make appearances in various sketches theyre also joined by other the state alums like joe lo truglio and todd holoubek the musical selections are also very well placedbr br ive enjoyed these sketches over and over again but they arent for everybody as theyre pretty vulgar most of the time if you like clever humor that isnt afraid to push the limits of good taste then i highly recommend this if you liked wet hot american summer directed and written by wain and showalter or the state then you should really enjoy thisbr br i think it can currently only be ordered online check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and then find out how to buy the dvd
