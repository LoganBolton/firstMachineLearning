one of the best films ive seen in a long time precise in its vision and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization i cant say much without giving it away and i dont recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeingjust see itbr br but ah one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on imdb conundrum what can i do tell you about the film nope cant do it i think i enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no preconceptions please you do the samebr br i suppose this can be said the acting is excellent and understated and what i have come to love about foreign movies is that the movies are actually about the movies not the stars
