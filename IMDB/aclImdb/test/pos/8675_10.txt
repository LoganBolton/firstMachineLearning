totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend  to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006
