this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princessdancing girl from michael rennie as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her citystate and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs for once she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by travilla lionel newmans music and the films style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald drayson adams script set in 1249 ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized neareastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and welldeveloped storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the films swift pace wellmanaged physical action sequences and superior technical aspects classicallytrained actors such as michael ansara edgar barrier wally cassell jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here one way of assessing a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions since my answer is a resounding yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and veryunderrated cinematic work could it be that us critics alltoofrequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to misprize this estimable films obvious antityranny and proentertainment qualities
