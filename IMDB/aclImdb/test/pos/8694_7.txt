this movie pops up now and again on the abc in australia at about 3 am in the morningbr br it starts off with the scene of a bus crash in londonbr br the films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses plus the lapsed photography of big ben winding back to symbolise what events occurred thirteen hours ago up until the bus crashbr br it took me a while to understand it but it was enjoyable nonethelessbr br if sean cunningham and quentin tarrantino got together and made a film this may be the result  due to the flashbacks and small stories tying in and deathsbr br i am unsure of the main characters as it has been a while since i have seen it but a rare gem indeed
