king vladislav angus scrimm of romania is a vampire but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind but his son radu anders hove is a cruel creature to his very heart which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him three female students have come to study local folklore but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time vladislav has been killedbr br who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from angus scrimm i cant i mean i had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures puppet master in particular and demonic toys but despite the really bad animated effects of the demons this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch plenty of blood a good plot and backstory the bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing and even some new angles on the vampire mythos which youd think would be dead by now maybe im wrong but this is probably the first film to feature rosary beads being fired from a gun aside from vampires and blood you get a share of nudity gratuitous but welcome and i had to notice the excellent score from the composers not sure who deserves credit but those involved include stuart brotman richard kosinski william levine michael portis and john zeretzka this is horror 101 all the way heck you even get two sequels which is the sign of a true horror film of course some bad films get sequels too  did i mention puppet master the romanian theme was welldone and the film even seems to have been made by romanians if i am guessing their name origins correctly and the score  the music  really stood out for me as a nice change of pace very moodsetting i like richard band but im glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head if you like vampire films and want a slight variation one of the eastern european variety this is worth seeing
