the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever there is something about them that makes them special i think its the feeling you get when you watch them br br they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700s or 1800s i think it has some thing to do with the sets that are used if so then its working keep it up guys br br in a quick round up of whats happened in the first part  radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite the blood stone and all his father has so he kills his father who is played by angus scrimm the tall man from the phantasm movies and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough well radus brother stephan trys to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a housefort which belongs to a friend of hisbr br well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on inbr br i will reviewcomment on the other sequels soon br br the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although radu does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle gellar br br rating for this movie 1010 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done br br
