this is one of the best and moodiest vampire tales ever i love this movie really the character are great even the locations and the story indeed the picture isnt a big budget production but it is absolutely worth seeingbr br ok there are some faults especially the names of the castle and the locations in this movie but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror moviebr br the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to realityi can say that honest because i visit them once when i was in romania in my vacationsbr br in my opinion this is the best part of the subspecies series
