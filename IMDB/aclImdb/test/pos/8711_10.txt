words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the subspecies themselveswhich were not executed well enough for a special effectso why do i glorify these movies for the herd of movie massconsumers out therewho care more about quantity than qualityabout cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesnt even deserve a capital letterunderworlddracula 2000dracula 3000 and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanaticon the other handis obvious the vampire himself is romanianthe story is set in transylvania the scenes filmed on location are more than convincingand the atmosphere is not based on any actionpacked chases or expensive orchestral musicradu himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romaniainclude some typical vampiric elements  such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in shortif like meyou re fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and darktheres no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie or in vampire journalsthe brilliant spin off of the former
