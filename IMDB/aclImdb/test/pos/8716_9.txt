i have to agree with all the previous commentersthis is simply the best of all frothy comedies with bardot as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was and definitely with a prettier face maybe theres less mystique but look how marilyn paid for that i dont think ive ever seen such a succulentlooking female on screen so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by itand not just for purely aesthetic reasons if the idiot evangelicals really want to do their convertaqueer number they are really going to need to up their standards as no church mice need apply hereher breasts the rest of her figure her adorable voice the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a roomonly to arrive in front of a man breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontationbr br i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history no one played opposite more great female stars than did he garbo dietrich k hepburn colbert and here bardot among many others and he was also in fanny with leslie caron and had small parts in how to steal a million with a hepburn as well as being in the deneuve movie the april fools although not opposite her the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriatei mean bardot is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else and her essential loudness i dont mean her voice is part of her irresistible and one might even say exemplary charmbr br vidal is thoroughly handsome even if pouty brigitte says toward the beginning i dont know why i am in love with you youre not even handsome br br dear dear bardot truly one of the wonders of the 20th century not to mention the joy that she is still with us when so many of the truly characterful are passing away so fast in all her eccentric glory
