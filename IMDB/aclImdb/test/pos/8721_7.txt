aside from the discotheque scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of monkees hits i am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up 37 years later but indeed it does thanks to the breezy execution of its deceptionbased plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads directed by the redoubtable stagetoscreen expert gene saks this 1969 comedy is about julian winston a successful manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor who pretends to be married in order to avoid longterm commitment with his young girlfriend of a year toni in response to tonis halfhearted suicide attempt julian agrees to marry her but toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience enter julians devoted nurse stephanie to play the wife and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and decouplingsbr br as julian a relaxed walter matthau dexterously plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner but he lets his two female costars walk off with the picture in her big screen debut a pixyish 24year old goldie hawn is still retaining her giggly laughin persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as toni she and matthau have great unforced chemistry in their scenes together screen legend ingrid bergman still serenely regal at 54 is obviously having a ball playing stephanie initially starchy and quickwitted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves i particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp there is nice supporting work from rick lenz as tonis bohemian neighbor igor and jack weston as julians smarmy actor buddy harvey billy wilders longtime collaborator ial diamond provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stagebound origins for saks who is not the most cinematic of directors other than a couple of trailers there are no significant extras with the dvd
