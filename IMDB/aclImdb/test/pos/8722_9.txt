what an absolutely charming movie the cast is wonderful and the story is witty and fun an all around pleasant movie experience although the plot is somewhat predictable it doesnt make the story any less enjoyable in fact i didnt want it to end ive always been a ingrid bergman fan and i was interested to see her in a comedic role she didnt let me down ingrid bergmans performance as ms dickinson is fun to watch i loved her interaction with toni at the music store as well as her dancing and doing the dentist it only further proved what i already knew that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time goldie hawn is also delightful to watch her fun gentlehearted and lovable toni is the driving force of the movie you dont even question why she would be so concerned about her finacees wife you just accept that shes just that type of person who wouldnt be happy unless she knew everyone else was also and walter matthau is great as julian his actions never create a feeling animosity for the viewer in fact they almost make him more enduring there wasnt an unlikable character in the bunch this movie has definitely with stood the test of time i watched it just last night and i think its one of the best romantic comedies ive ever seen if youre looking for a fun lighthearted romantic comedy look no further
