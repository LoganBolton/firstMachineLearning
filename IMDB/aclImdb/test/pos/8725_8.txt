well i would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws i didnt believe for a minute that matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist also hawns character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous however the film does succeed due to a good pace humor and its stars matthau may not have been a dentist but he was as amusing as he usually is bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film especially during the scene where her and matthau go out for a drink after work and also a good deal of humor i believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after overhearing a couple scenes hawns performance is noteworthy although an oscar may have been over doing it a bit basically dont take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself
