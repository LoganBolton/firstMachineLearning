goldie hawn in 1969 was best known for playing in television comedy shows  in particular rowan and martins laugh in where she was the giggly cookie young blond she did make movies before cactus flower the most notable being a walt disney feature the one and only genuine original family band but cactus flower picked up on her character from laughin and due to a good script by ial diamond  billy wilders second partner  based on an abe burrows play she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out as a result ms hawn won an oscar for best supporting actress in 1969 and her career took off to such future hits as private benjamin and the first wives club although other stars of laughin did well on television henry gibson has a recurring role as a judge on boston legal only goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie starbr br on laughin goldies personality would show a naivet√© that would be embarrassing occasionally she realized it and would laugh loud to cover but sometimes she just did not see her error example goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host gary moore and is told goldie this is mr gary moore she shakes his hand and says much to his confusion ive always wanted to meet mr john gary moore but as toni simmons it is quite different she is desperately in love with dr julian winston walter matthau a successful dentist who can never marry her julian has told her that his wife with whom he has had two sons and a daughter will never give him a divorce so at the start of the film toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove but she is rescued by her neighbor igor sullivan rick lenz a struggling dramatist who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas br br toni is resigned to live but she has sent a suicide note to julian igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but julians receptionistnurseassistant stephanie dickinson ingrid bergman wont stop julians work schedule to pass him the phone when igor calls instead julian finds the letter and races to tonis apartment only to find her alive when igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself julian realizes the depth of her love and decides he must marry such a woman unfortunately toni has swallowed julians lies and believes in his wife and children you see julian has no wife and children since toni is a firm believer that she cant marry a man who would lie to her julian is stuck on a weakening tree branchbr br julian comes to solve it by getting stephanie to pretend she is mrs winston stephanie is opposed to it at first but on her own on her first free saturday she confronts toni at the record shop toni is at they talk and toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of stephanie and since stephanie has her two nephews with her toni thinks they are julians kids toni tells julian they have to see who is the man that stephanie is supposedly going to marry so the lie starts spiraling for julian stephanie and toni soon a lover is given to stephanie in the form of julians friend and freeloading patient harvey greenfield jack weston greenfield is so sleazy stephanie loathes him that toni feels that he is unworthy of stephaniebr br and so it goes with one complication most caused by the wellintentioned misinformed toni following another until the conclusion the script is full of first rate situations and oneliners example julian to reward stephanie for lying about their marriage buys two record albums from tonis store he has given a mink stole to toni but she decides to send it to stephanie with julians card stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got  when she profusely thanks matthau he says the thought shed like horowitz  meaning vladomir horowitz but stephanie thinks horowitz is the name of the furrier br br bergman must have enjoyed the filming as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films but there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit indiscreet there cary grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage when grants lie is revealed to bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince grant that she was making him a cuckold here instead of being the passive lover believing matthau is telling the truth bergman gingerly tries to get matthau out of his mess by little white lies only to find one leads to another to complicate everyones lives bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem despite trying to be part of the solutionbr br all the leads perform well in particular bergman all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just cant be kicked aside the supporting cast especially weston as the mooching and sexually slimy harvey and vito scotti as the un ambassador who actually has the hots for bergman it was a clever comedy and a really good way for goldie hawns movie career to push forward
