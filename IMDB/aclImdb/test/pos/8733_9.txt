ive been playing this movie incessantly this month and i just love it i was around in the 60s oh dear so it is nostalgic in one sense however its the funny premise the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watchingbr br dr winstons reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless id be more specific but dont want to spoil it for anyone who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the upandup and yet have us still love him as for bergmans costumes i think she looks as dowdy as shes supposed to i think she was robbed the one time that she appears in an evening gown it doesnt suit her at all which is too bad i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still dontbr br goldie won an oscar for her role people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time and yet its the one performance that i dont love as much as the others she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability however which is important for this rolebr br and i agree  i thought rick lenz was great in it and its too bad that his movie career didnt take off after thisbr br i hope more people watch this movie  theyll love it
