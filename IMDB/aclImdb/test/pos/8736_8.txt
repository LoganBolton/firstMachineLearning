i discovered this late one night on turner classics i kept saying to myself ill turn it off as soon as it stops being funny but needless to say i watched the whole way throughbr br i am a movie junkie but i had never even heard of this movie or if i did in 1971 i forgot its worth watching just for the performance of goldie hawn as the tarttongued ing√©nue her acting is a revelation in this movie yes the script is sharp and excellent when was the last time they made a hollywood comedy with a smart script but her acting is extraordinary i never realized how funny goldie could be and it makes her later appearances in roles such as laughin and private benjamin a little sad in her later career she is far too overthetop compared to her minimalist wickedly funny appearance herebr br its a pleasure watching the young matthau the great bergman and the stellar supporting cast but its goldie hawn that will make this movie worth watching again
