cactus flower is what i call a pizza movie a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy perfect for an evening at home with a pizza knowing all the lines and what lines by heart only enhances the enjoymentbr br since so many others here have retold the plot ill simply add the correction that bergmans character miss dickinson was a nursereceptionist meaning she was a skilled nurse and therefore an educated person not just a receptionistbr br bergmans performance in this film and the film itself was largely dismissed at the time but todays audiences will marvel at her range not just the impeccable comic timing but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to toni and to us while the general plot stretches credibility bergmans performance is compelling honest and utterly believablebr br also a standout is jack westons performance as the matthaus old friend and coconspirator harvey no one could deliver a zinger like weston and ial diamonds script gives him plenty for example thats such a big dirty rotten lie it has class weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters flaws br br the film is a fairly straight adaptation of the abe burrows play which was itself adapted from a french play by barillet and gredy on broadway matthaus role was played by barry nelson bergmans by lauren bacall and hawns by brenda vaccaro it ran for 1234 performances three years and was nominated for two tony awards vaccaro and burt brinckerhoff who played igorbr br for me the films score written and adapted by the legendary quincy jones is another highlight the main theme a time for love is anytime is performed by sarah vaughn over the opening and closing credits it is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring bermans speech to hawn in the record store jones also created covers of popular songs from the period to sir with love im a believer for the night club scenes as with all of the films elements there is a tremendous amount of talent taste and professionalism evident br br in my opinion few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic its great to finally have it available on dvd time to call for a pizza
