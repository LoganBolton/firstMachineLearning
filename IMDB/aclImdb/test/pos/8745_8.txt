ive read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries i certainly cant agree on such a blanket statement if you analyze all of the aspects of a videofilm production there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superiorbr br certainly many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the miniseries specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the pakistani farmer and family that said i found catherine zetajones character much more compelling as the desperate women from poverty to riches who wont go back thats a much more likable character than this cold women who didnt seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil and yes i understandher children she was desperate i just didnt see her as being as desperatebr br further while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the miniseries benicio del toros character was very compelling an anchor for the film that thread was changed as an alternative to the pakistani family in nothing but good ways a fantastic adaptation of course im skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system but i dont know enough about the politics of the nation to arguebr br after watching the first episode of the miniseries i actually rewatched the film why i kept reading about the fantastic acting i found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries to be borderline laughable certainly this improved as the miniseries progressed now having just finished both versions in a few days i cant agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as say benicio del toro who was brilliant in the film though ormand paterson shah and lindsay duncan were very good i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the miniseries i was not impressed with the germans throughoutbr br finally the dialogue as delivered in the film is much more nuanced especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim careful youre beginning to sound like your husband as opposed to hahahaha you sound like karl again i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing this was a prime examplebr br other superior aspects of the film in my opinion score cinematography editingbr br should i complain that the film wasnt longer no i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format the changes made stood on their own i mean would you sit in a theater for 5 710 hours of course notbr br miniseries 8 out of 10br br film 9 out of 10
