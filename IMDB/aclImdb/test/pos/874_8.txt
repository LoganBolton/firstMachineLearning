ive slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time  fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of thembr br next to the soft skin coincidentally staring deneuves sister the late francoise dorleac this would have to be my favourite truffaut filmbr br as well as directing truffaut also wrote the screenplay something that always strikes me about truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story  one could almost call it naivetybr br theres a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot he rings the doorbell and deneuve answers wearing a negligee in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street deneuve changes into her dress puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep its a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child  but thats truffaut for youbr br watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60s is indeed a sensory pleasure she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch incidentally for those fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film  indeed a sinful pleasurebr br i disagree with previous posters i see nothing hitchcockian about the film at all as for the look of it  i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60s it certainly gives films of this period a unique lookbr br highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans
