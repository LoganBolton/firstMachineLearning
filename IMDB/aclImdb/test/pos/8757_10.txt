i had been very curious to see the original sixhour miniseries that steven soderberghs latest movie was based on and now that i have i am happy to say that one is not better than the other they are both intelligent involving and extremely entertaining the only real advantage that the miniseries has over the movie is that it is three and a half hours longer so we get to know the characters more in depthbr br there isnt a false note to be had in this production one that you should definitely make time for when pbs rebroadcasts this miniseries sometime in 2001 you wont regret it
