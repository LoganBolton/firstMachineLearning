excellent hitchcock thriller with robert cummings proving once again that he could really act up a stormbr br this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plantbr br priscilla lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from california to nybr br there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a directorbr br ironically the film implodes at the very end while we see what happens to the guy who killed cummings friend we dont see what happens to the rest of the gang again many of whom represent the upper crust of society
