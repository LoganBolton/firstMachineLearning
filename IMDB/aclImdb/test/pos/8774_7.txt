overall this is entertaining and odd film dont try to make sense of it there are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with but robert cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this fugitivelike storybr br unlike the popular tv show and then 1993 movie this fugitive isnt looking for a onearmed man but a twoarmed nazi saboteur by the the name of frank fry cummings barry kane gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in los angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it fry to clear his namebr br the first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting then priscilla lane pat martin enters the story and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog director alfred hitchcock often did that with his female characters to the point i wonder if he had a clue how woman talked lanes character here was a little lamebr br actually the villains played by otto kruger charles tobin and norman lloyd frank fry were the best in my opinionjust fascinating krugers acting and dialog was especially goodbr br if you havent seen this film but saw hitchcocks wellknown north by northwest youll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it instead of a climactic scene at mount rushmore here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the state of liberty as usual hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view
