i really loved seeing this movie i think its a brilliant underrated alfred hitchcock movie everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene but theres a really great movie before that robert cummings is great in what i consider to be his greatest role and the beautiful priscilla lane shows that she has a lot of talent too but i think norman lloyd gives the best performance his character fry is so evil and devious even though hes not in it for very long the movie wouldnt be the same without himbr br saboteur is a great movie that every hitchcock fan should see i give it a 10 out of 10
