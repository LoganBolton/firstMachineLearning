hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business whos accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they cant get out of until the dastardly plot thats behind their troubles is resolved that way the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero we certainly do in this fine film barry kane is only trying to help his fellowman out by performing acts of kindness and consideration like helping fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory barry even returns a lost 100 bill to fry later onthat was big money in 1943 its barrys acts of christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon hes wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he cant clear himself similar to the 39 steps in plot the hero travels crosscountry where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells an archvillain who nobody could believe to be a closetnazi and a beautiful blonde patricia martin who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with barry kane hitchs trademark touches of humor are here too patricia is a billboard model whos various roadside ads are a help and comfort to barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys all the way from las vegas to nyc we meet a trucker whos a oneman comedy act someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the suits just as if they were working for some legit enterprise during a chase scene into a cinema audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedygangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing moviepatron awful for the dead old man but funny hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance with the statue of liberty as backdrop and ironic icon it works even better than the mt rushmore scene in nbnw
