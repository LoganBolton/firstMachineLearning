this movie was marketed extremely well when it was released in 97 during the middle of master ps fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves thats why its no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250000 copies and still goinbr br if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out it has a few old school phatty videos and dont get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party so what i got to say to all the people who dont like master p or no limit records dont watch it because it isnt for you and dont bother voting on it because youre only going to deter tru no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes
