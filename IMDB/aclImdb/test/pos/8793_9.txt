well i should say the only film related to clubdjelectronic music and ravesthat ravers respectbr br seriously now its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver albeit its in a club its in wales and its somewhat dated the film leaves out some of the sketchier elements of club life but doesnt disassociate from them altogether it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters livesbr br at the core of the film and the best element of justin kerrigans script is the characters eccentric unique yet completely understandable and accessible this film simple would not work and be infinitely less entertaining were it not for jip koop nina moff and lulu viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of human traffic as a drug film trainspotting wannabe important peg in british youth culture circa 90s butthey cant deny that these are engaging charactersbr br its frantic its brutally honest its sobering its over the top but its a great comedy br br raves are a complex thing so are the drugs that are taken at these events so are the people you will encounter but from someone who has gone to parties become jaded and still goeshuman traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken of the subculture just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic
