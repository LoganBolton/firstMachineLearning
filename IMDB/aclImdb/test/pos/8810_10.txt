it takes a lot for a movie to reach the already numb particles of my brain which have not already been tapped out due to the overcharge and redoredoredocopycopycopy world of movies but this movie has made it onto my magic movies list to become a magic movie it must leave every string of my being quivering in that which i can only define as bliss and complete satisfaction this movie has tapped into the fibers of how my mind thinks and if not for the deeply personal bond my head and the head of whoever made this shares it would look like another dead rave scene movie from back when the 90s exploded with its ecstasy craze this is not how the movie came off to me at all its reached into me and pulled up something that i thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as to give it a critique of my own i forgot how long its been since ive seen something that left me feeling this good inside i strongly suggest seeing this movie
