this film was hilarious it provided a somewhat comical view of the british club scene which if you really look at it is a funny thing the characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselvesbr br there were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work the getting ready scenes the get me a real doctor scene the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being wrecked ending with the infamous line what was i saying and the comedownsunup scenes i have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviourbr br i cant give this movie a 10 because it doesnt measure up to groove which i thought was out of this world but it certainly has its moments the miseenscene and the camera work is superb the special effects are well worth mentioning and the acting is fantasticbr br after waiting a long time to see this film i am glad to say that i was not disappointed i hope to see more from the writerdirector in the future
