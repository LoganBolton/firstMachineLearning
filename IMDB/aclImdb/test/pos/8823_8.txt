a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listening to round the horne or hancocks half hour or watching carry on films probably the most famous line in comedy infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy still makes me laughbr br this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final quotation from the coroners court read in four different voices by michael sheen he was brilliant in the role most of the other members of the carry on team were soso and their kenneth horne was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for himbr br it left me feeling wow to quote kenneth williams to the cynic who says life is a joke the only response can be yes well lets make it a good one
