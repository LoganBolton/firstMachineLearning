id first heard of this show in 2005 first online and then by viewing and of course buyingthe typically gorgeous bbc tiein book then i got the dvd it did not disappoint id been hoping for years someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens laser gun fights and other hollywood boogieman gimmicks thank you joe ahearne also for your dr who work and ultravioletthe miniseries not the crap movie of the same name what compelled me to write this now 2 yrs later was that id just seen sunshine last night and what appeared to be in the same family as space odyssey turned into about 23rds of the way in freddy krueger meets 2010 that was when space odyssey really stood out as a positive example of how to do a real science fiction film more science less fiction odyssey like sunshine also dealt with astronaut shortcomings zoes failed eva ivans over exertions on venus the spats with mission control and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers the fatal radiation spike on mars i wouldve easily paid to see this in a theater imax anyone and to top it all not only were the space vistas jaw droppingly beautiful but the characters were nicely drawn too i found their interplay more realistic than the wallslamming histrionics of sunshines icarus 2 crew icarus dumb name for a solar missiondid anyone read the mythology of icarus sometimes it takes a notsogood film to compel one to rewatch a better film as an armchair astronaut id trade my passage on icarus for a seat on pegasus any day in all fairness however the visuals of sunshine are quite stunning though and quite memorable which is why i was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honesttogoodness scifi film so even though this review is almost a backdoor review of sunshine i hope its read for what it was meant to be strong support for a bbc telefilm that succeeds where most bigbudget bloated cinematic spectacles fail space odyssey aka voyage to the planets here in the states whets the appetite for solid sciencefiction and delivers a banquet i very much enjoyed the pseudodocumentary approach as well as for the time laglightspeed quibbles they are addressed if you pay attention where sunshine melts odyssey keeps its cool if youre considering going to the movies for another dose of sunshine stay in go for a true space odyssey instead
