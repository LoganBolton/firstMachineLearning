when john carpenters masterly version of the thing was released in summer 1982 it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office the audiences couldnt handle another bad alien they wanted et their loss in the long runbr br i would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen this is a movie that was way ahead of its time now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers showing its trail on things like se7en alien 3 and even the x files which unceremoniously ripped it off page by page and the structure which eschews character development in favour of incredible sfx is commonplace in todays blockbuster flicksbr br carpenter shows the same skills he honed in halloween using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere the performances are all fine and the ending is terrific  still unique todaybr br a paranoid masterpiece
