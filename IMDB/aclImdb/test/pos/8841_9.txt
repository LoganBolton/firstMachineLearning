i first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on tv and i was up far too late i really lucked out there though its truly incredible from the location as isolated as its possible to be on this planet it made the abyss look like et in the council swimming pool through the interesting characters keith david is especially good as the reactionary childs what if were wrong about him  then were wrong and the effects more yucky than alienbr br moreover however the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects its the people you start being scared of knowing that one of them may  or may not be  all they appear to be its certainly got the feel of who goes therebr br the soundtrack is great it really plays up the isolation fear and gravity of the situationbr br finally the epilogue scene really really cuts even more than the but then again who does  punchline of bladerunner enough said
