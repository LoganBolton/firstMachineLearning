i cannot believe i never added my two cents about this film as yetbr br this is one of the best films of all time many critics and moviegoers alike talk of john carpenters halloween for setting trends and being his best work those folks have not seen this version of the thing because it is right up there with halloweenbr br john carpenters work shines in this film he took a film that was already made and instead of remaking the film he made the book the first film was based on brilliantbr br the casting of each man was great the tension between them was real it made me scream made me scared made me guess made me laugh made me question even up to today who goes there in that film this film had no hollywood sweetie pie or funnytype ending and what a bold move not to have one in 1982 another brilliant movebr br i was at the screening for this film when i was on vacation in southern california the audience at the screening went wild i carry those memories for years it was so much fun we all thought that there was no way on gods green earth this film was not going to be a hit but by box office receipts it was a dud because of et the extra terrestrial and poltergeist two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came outbr br this film was what i as a horror film adult buff was looking for a horrorthriller with an adult script and real adult actors not kids playing adults not little miss bigbreasted screamqueen of the day running around screaming for titilation but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues youll ever hear heck being a feminist i didnt even miss women in this film and good for mr carpenter by not putting one in there it really wouldnt have made sense unless the thing was actually feminine something to think aboutbr br i saw special effects of that time i had never seen before i saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights this is what horrorthrillers of today are missing today the directors wimp out today the studios wimp out too much cgi and not enough belief too much cgi and not enough story not enough imagination you leave the theater and in a week  or less  you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening this one stays with ya thats one of the marks of an excellent filmbr br on many reviews ive written how now paying 10 for a film is horrid for films like this one youd pay it and not feel slighted this film is not for everyonebr br i find it horrific that they lable this film a cult film i find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982 this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad after john carpenters film many people copied many techniques makeup special effects and story lines from this version of the thingbr br i am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time very much under rated please see it uncut please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally youll talk about it for years as well
