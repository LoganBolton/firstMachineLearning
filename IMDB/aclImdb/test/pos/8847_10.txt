for me a tenstar film is one that never dies in my memory and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time this could be a technically flawed movie the pleasure has nothing to do with spitandpolish my personal topten is idiosyncratic to say the least john carpenters the thing is one of very few films to fit this criterionbr br ive been a science fiction fan since i was a child in the sixties and i read the john w campbell short story on which the film is based who goes there before i saw the original blackandwhite howard hawks film as with a lot of people that viewing was illicit on the tv when i should have been in bed that movie as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances seemed near perfection the suspense the inexplicable nature of the alien the photography it all just seemed to work i watched it many times in the years after and still do when it is shown on tv because of this i avoided the carpenter version for years  seeing remakes of ones favourite film is i thought always a mistake when i did eventually watch it sometime in 19889 again on tv because there was nothing else on i realised that i need to change always a mistake to usually a mistake carpenter had produced something different from the original film closer to the original story and truly wonderful from the opening scene of the helicopter and husky through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dogpound to that ending sorry no spoilers here i was hooked the sound track alone lives with me  all i have to hear is a close similarity to that bassoversnare drum beat and im in the final scene again br br until seeing the thing i had carpenter down as just another goremonkey based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press since seeing the thing i think i have seen most of his movies  i havent gone out of my to do so but if one comes up just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it he is thoughtful and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memorybr br if you havent seen the thing and you enjoy science fiction do yourself a favour  sit down in a dark room wrap up warm and prepare to have your memory enhanced
