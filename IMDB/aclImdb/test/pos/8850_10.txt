john carpenters the thing is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made sadly as with most carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after its release for a reason that is almost pathetic it seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the good alien an idea spawned after the success of it and the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy human ignorance is truly a frightening thing people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to bebr br the thing itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a us antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being refered throughout the movie only as a thing able to imitate any form of life not knowing who might or might not be the creature we see how every character reacts to the situation there is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be not quite humanbr br carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average scifihorror there are no whats behind you jumping moments here instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and preapocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to rob bottins impressive creature effects he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror filmsbr br instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach by implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpretate what has transpired in certain scenes while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in moviesbr br ennio morricones score works all the way its minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movies overall tone although ive always wondered how would it have sounded if carpenter he has been known to compose all of his moviess osts except this one did it characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially kurt russel who plays the downout apathetic helicopter pilot rj macready its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie from his disregardful dont give a  attitude in the beginning to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight the thing but even with that said there are no false heroics here there are no laughing at the face of death moments and there certainly isnt any sort of comic relief the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last speaking of which here once again carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful endingbr br quarter of a century after its release the thing doesnt feel dated and with the disturbingly growing use of computergenerated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the lifes work and dedication of human beings not computers combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or  time a masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten
