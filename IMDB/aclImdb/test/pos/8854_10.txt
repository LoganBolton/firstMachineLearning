the thing is a milestone in moviemaking and remains one of my favourite films of alltime despite the films roots in sciencefiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma today over twenty five years after its release the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man rob bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art it would be impossible to make the same movie today as the studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a paulwalker typebr br an allmale american science team in antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien lifeform able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation and this bodysnatchers scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as onebyone they fall victim to the thing when cornered it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature the metamorphosis always horrific and compellingbr br the helplessness isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained the long hours of darkness and the mounting snowfall provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds director john carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant characteractors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play whether it be the young and streetwise chef the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot the point is that noone here comes close to being an allamerican badass superhero with blonde locks and a sixpack and the films real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism the people suffering onscreen are recognisable in our daily livesbr br the thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings i have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction the acting and the special effects is unwavering my girlfriend prefers the highschool spinoff of the film the faculty which is good and solid entertainment but far more lighthearted and whistful she still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of the thing however and thank goodness for that because i could not remain in the company of someone who didnt love this moviebr br a classic and then some
