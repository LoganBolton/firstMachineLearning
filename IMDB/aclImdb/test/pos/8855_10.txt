in 1982 two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielbergs et and john carpenters the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in drovesbr br its not hard to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the stillbeating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the things tentacles and slime coated salivabr br its taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner alien and thats even rarerbr br carpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds thembr br frequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenters perpetual antiheroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what theyre researching is anyones guess the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macreadys trying to gun down a siberian husky from the airbr br they end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shapechanging alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12man crew until noone is certain who is human and who is notbr br the thing is one of john carpenters finest films in fact im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenters list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier worksbr br but the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct 13 from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising joltbr br the film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenters hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film amorphous shapes halfformed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the films effects are so amazing and squirminducing the thing came under fire for being too realisticbr br that type of thinking misses the point entirely it only shortchanges the films values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenters strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing were never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewingsbr br a special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they bloodtest each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realisingbr br the thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received and so much better than et
