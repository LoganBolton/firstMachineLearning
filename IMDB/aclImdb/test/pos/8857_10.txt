the silly saying you cant touch this surely applies here with all the clone horror and scifi films coming out along with all the inferior remakes its hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time thats why i always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when i was a preteenbr br the thing is without an ounce of doubt in my mind the goriest ickiest screechiest scifi horror classic that john carpenter or any other director sorry even you mr spielberg ever made what really gives it power though is not the gore it ooooozes of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids but rather the sense of dread isolation and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewerbr br you cant get more remote than antarctica and in this howling freezing white setting is where the story takes place several americans researchers and military men are stationed there one day they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gunwielding norwegians before they know it the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before its finished but once its finished if you didnt see it in progress you cant tell it among humans or other normal earth animalsbr br kurt russell keith david wilford brimley richard masur donald moffatt tk carter thomas waites and charles hallahan are just a few of the fine cast this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre it actually still scares me the alien blood jumping out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jumpbr br still the scariest of them all
