many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie my movie will always be john carpenters the thing the main reason why this movie is a cultfilm is perhaps the splattereffects created mainly by genius rob bottin and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today along with escape from ny in my opinion this is not a great film because of the effects it has to do with the story the atmosphere and of course the acting i have watched thousands and thousands of movies 36 every day the last 10 years but none has had the impact on me as this one not even the great das bootbr br heres my suggestion to you who likes scifi and horror movies place yourself in the good chair of your home be sure youre not interupted by anyone if you aint got a projector sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film let it absorbe you and youll see it my waybr br best view time late february between 5 and 9 in the evening
