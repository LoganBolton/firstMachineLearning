antarctica winter 1982 the team on an american research base get surprised by a couple of mad norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter trying to kill it all the norwegians are killed and the americans are left with nothing but a dog a couple of bodies and questions thats the beginning of the greatest horrorthriller film ive ever seenbr br from the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense paranoid mood helpless and alone out in nomans land ennio morricone was nominated for a razzie award for his score why i dont know cause as far as i can see his score is simple creepy and very good it really gets you in the right moodbr br the acting is great the best performance is probably given by the dog whos just amazing as for russell and the others on two legs i can say nothing lessbr br you may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive well think again you havent seen it all until youve seen this bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms rob bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeupbr br the movie didnt get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so its not very well known in fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie nobody ive asked have heard of it however the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and dvd twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date this movie is to be considered a classicbr br the movie is without doubt one of my if not my favorite ive seen it several times but its just as good as the first time i saw it as a norwegian the only thing i dont like about this movie is that macready keeps calling the norwegians swedes
