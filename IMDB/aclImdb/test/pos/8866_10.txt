i know im human and if you were all these things then youd just attack me right now so some of you are still human this thing doesnt want to show itself it wants to hide inside an imitation itll fight if it has to but its vulnerable out in the open if it takes us over then it has no more enemies nobody left to kill it and then its wonbr br john carpenters the thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made  fast clever and purely exciting from start to finish this is how all movies of the genre should be madebr br taking place in the antarctic in 1982 the movie focuses specifically on a group of american scientists we are given no introduction to their mission but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy norwegians appears at their base camp chasing an escaped dog the norwegians are killed and the dog finds its way into the colony which is when things really start to get crazybr br it is soon made quite clear that the dog is actually a shapeshifting alien organism which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims  in other words it begins to eat the americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesbr br the pack of scientists led by macready kurt russell begin to fight for their own survival using wits instead of brawn if the thing is indeed amongst them then how are they to go about revealing it how many things are there how can the thing be killed or can it be destroyed at allbr br the creatures origins in the film are explained easily thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to earth and was frozen in the antarctic ice the thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice by the norwegians who unknowingly released it from its natural prisonbr br the thing the movie itself is similar to ridley scotts iconic alien 1979 many comparisons have been made  the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off onebyone however the thing  for all practical purposes  came firstbr br based on the famous short story who goes there by john w campbell jr writing under pseudonym as don a stuart the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by howard hawks and christian nyby the result was the thing from another world an unarguable classic but to be fair it bore little resemblance to the short story and carpenters remake does it more justicebr br the idea of the thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great and is the most vital link to the short story in 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shapeshifting organism but thirtyone years brought many advances in sfxbr br creature effects artist rob bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gorefest into a startlingly frightening and realistic mess of blood and fear the thing although never actually taking one specific form is constantly seen in a morphing stage and the effects are simply superb they still pack a punch twentytwo years laterbr br ennio morricones score nominated for a razzie award at the time is a bit too electronic and tinny but nevertheless haunting when used correctlybr br from the fact that its cast consists entirely of males to the fact that its ending is one of the most thoughtprovoking and untypical conclusions of all time the thing  by any standards  is unconventional hollywood at its best it comes as no surprise that at the time of its release the thing performed poorly in theaters and et  released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien  became the highergrossing picture of the two by farbr br in the long run however the thing is superior in almost every conceivable way spielbergs tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th anniversary rerelease the thing on the other hand has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics  it is one of the most famous nonfamous movies ever madebr br carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career  from his amazing assault on precinct 13 1976 to the magnificent halloween 1978 to the disappointing and silly escape from la 1996 the thing remains his very best motion picture although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most great movies lists the thing is still one of my favorite horror films and  upon close inspection  masterfully crafted it is a daring and ingenious thrillride that is simultaneously unique and chilling  a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knockoffs this one at the very least is genuinely unpredictable
