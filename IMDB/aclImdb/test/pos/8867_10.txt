throw momma hasnt dated at all its as funny now as when it was released a genuinely eccentric comedy that doesnt try too hard to be liked and is all the better for it full of memorable laugh out loud lines even small characters are well written and beautifully played like billy crystals best friends girlfriend and a lovely cameo from rob reiner as crystals agent a little bit insane and a lot funny
