this movie is extremely funny  the character of momma keeps me returning to the movie time and time again i cant get enough of her dry lines  like when she tells her son owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he smells up the place  and her suspicion that owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts its hilariousbr br if you like movies such as national lampoons vacation uncle buck or planes trains  automobiles this has similar humor its a great wholesome laugh  a must see
