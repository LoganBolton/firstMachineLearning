when i watched this movie when i was a kid i didnt understand the premise of hitchcock movies and dark comedy now that im in my mid 20s it makes a lot more sensebr br i think the reason i like this movie so much is that the comedy duo of billy crystal and danny devito make for some interesting comedy both slapstick the frying pan and car scenes and verbal the argumentsconversations over murder and writingbr br the story revolves around larry donnercrystal a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife margaret played by a surprisingly radiant kate mulgrew aka capt janeway from star trek voyagerbr br while he shifts between writers block and teaching creative writing class he meets with student owen liftsdevito an aspiring writer and overgrown mamas boy who sadly still acts like a kid he has toy train tracks need i say more think of failure to launch only matt mcconaughey is short fat and baldbr br owen is stuck in his own life with a demanding evil motheranne ramsey who he cant stand he seeks larrys advice on how to get out of it and when he says to go see a hitchcock film owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills larrys wife hell return the favor and kill his mom for him hilarity ensues while the two try to deal with each others problem owen goes to extremes to kill margaret while larry who refuses to agree to do his part of the plan is driven nuts by owens motherbr br throughout the film larry and owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare in dark comedy nowadays one part of the movie i really loved was where owen shows larry his coin collection and lets just say its more a sentimental collection than anythingbr br the two main stars aside the late anne ramsey is hilarious as mama and deadly with that cane of hers shes a lot more comedic verbally and physically in this as opposed to her role as mama fratelli from the goonies so she curses like a sailor and belittles her son at every turn but thats what makes her character so vivid she makes her character the kind of person you love to hatebr br another treat in this movie is the music of jazz great brandford marsalis who plays larrys neighbor and friend lester there is a great moment in the movie where he plays jazz for larry who is depressed and needs some good tunes to relieve the pain jazz can do thatbr br in closing i wish billy crystal and danny devito would do another good movie together but their kinda getting too old for the game im sad to say this is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in their own subtle ways devitos childish comedy and crystals sharp wit made this movie for me 5 star comedy
