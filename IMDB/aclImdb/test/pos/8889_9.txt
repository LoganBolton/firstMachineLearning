if you had a mother that described you like that you just might be looking to bump her off yourself its how danny devito feels about anne ramsey its just how to put the plan in actionbr br and his creative writing class taught by professor billy crystal gives him the idea that and a viewing of alfred hitchcocks classic strangers on a train which gives devito the idea to switch murders with crystal who hates his wife kate mulgrew who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write but is also carrying on with hunky tony cicconebr br throw momma from the train plays out kind of like strangers on a train as devito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme but crystals having a bit of a problem putting ramsey down even with dannys help that woman might need killing but shes going to take a lot of itbr br the only academy recognition that throw momma from the train got was an academy award nomination for anne ramsey for best supporting actress ramsey lost to olympia dukakis for moonstruck but the film turned out to be her finest hour ramsey already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year but look at the list of credits she managed to amass even after throw momma from the train she worked right up to the endbr br ive seen interviews with both of the stars of throw momma from the train billy crystal and danny devito and both have gladly conceded that anne ramseys performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them their acknowledgment of ramseys talent and performance is the best possible tributebr br if marion lorne in strangers on a train had been anything like anne ramsey here farley granger would gladly have joined robert walker in disposing of her throw momma from a train is one of the best black comedies out there should not be missed
