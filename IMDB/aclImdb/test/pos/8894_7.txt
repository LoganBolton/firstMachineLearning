owen loves his mammaonly hed love her better six feet under in this dark laughoutloud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title rolebr br throw momma from the train is a terrific comedy even if it isnt a great film its too shallow in parts and the ending feels less organic than tacked on but its a gutsplitting ride most of the way with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer devito is avid but untalented crystal is blocked and bitterbr br crystals professor donner believes his exwife stole his book the unfortunately titled hot fire and cant write more than the opening line of his next book which doesnt come easy he teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities including a middleaged woman who writes tom clancytype fiction but doesnt know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life mr pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughsperminutesonscreen an ascotwearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus 100 girls id like to porkbr br then theres devitos owen lift who calls himself professor donners star pupil even though the teacher wont read his work in class owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie a manchild in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother anne ramsey who calls him lardass and other endearing sentiments in any other movie wed be asked to feel sorry for owen but throw momma from the train piles lifes cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along thats one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of peoplebr br for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even identifying with him and take the rest of what we see here as a lark its not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donners help in a plan to kill his mother actually he first goes to hawaii to kill donners hated ex then tells the professor its his turn to kill mrs lift swapping murders as seen in hitchcocks strangers on a trainbr br as a director devito not only complements his actors performances with scenesetting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes and away from taking things too seriouslybr br also helping matters is writer stu silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here shes not a womanshes the terminator one little murder and im jack the ripper those are all crystals words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are devitos and ramseys apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the imdb and thats a shame because he had real talent for itbr br the best scene in this movie when crystal meets ramsey was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical coming attraction presentation the only time ive seen a movie promoted that way owen introduces the professor to his mother as cousin patty and when momma says he doesnt have a cousin patty panicky owen loses it you lied to me he yells out slamming the professors forehead with a panbr br of course in reality the professor wouldnt groan out something witty from the floor but throw momma from the train works effectively at such moments when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth devito hasnt disappeared from films of course but its a mystery why he hasnt really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe its because as throw momma from the trains lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isnt to everyones tastes thats too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it
