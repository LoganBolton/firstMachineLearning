its a shame that asterix and his buddy obelix do not get the world wide recognition that other cartoon comic characters getbr br this is another funny asterix cartoon jammed with entertainment the animation is excellent and the voice characterization good even if the synchronization is a little out the music and score fit well within the story and the slotting in of some modern musical numbers is a nice touchbr br the running time seems short and while its not the best asterix story or the most developed cartoon its good clean fun the modern disney like animation will capture children asterix fans and new comers enjoy the gaul adventure
