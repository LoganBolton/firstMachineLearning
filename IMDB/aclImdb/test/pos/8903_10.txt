wow its even better than i expected the best animated astérix movie ever and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of astérix again i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of astérix but i suggest that you go to see the french version cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast did you know that roger carel has played astérix for nearly forty years i think he did a marvelous job and the song from céline dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits the music is good the drawings are good the actors are wonderful in a word a masterpiece go to see it you will not regret this
