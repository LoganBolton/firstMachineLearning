 but i laughed a lotbr br i saw astérix et les vikings at a public screening during the world cup the sound was lousy it was too bright to see the screen properly  but i still enjoyed myself immensely the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor smsix abba vikea all not very witty but in good astérix tradition some very good jokes but also some that not everybody seemed to getbr br the only thing i didnt like were the voices of astérix and obélix in the german version at least the voice actors are very wellknown around here which was the only reason they were casted really they dont fit the characters at allbr br all in all a good way to spend some time and if its free like in my case all the better and to have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10
