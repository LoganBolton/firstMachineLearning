since the last horrid astérix film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas here i went to watch it with quite a bit of trepidation unfounded as i was happy to discover br br the film is funny and modern has good gags a good animation an amusing character interaction a good voice cast note i can only speak for the swiss german one except for the viking chiefs daughter abba her name is great despite the not very inspired voice actressbr br i especially liked the character justforkix goudurix in french grautvornix in german hes the young man who is supposed to be put in shape hes a very amusing portrayal of a mollycoddled urban teenager but hes very likable despite the teenage mannerisms xd the interaction between astérix  obélix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertainingbr br it shouldnt be compared to the old films since this one is quite different which surprisingly doesnt make it bad on the contrary when they tried to modernize the last film twelve years ago they completely blew it this film however proved that it can be done just fine br br i came out of the theater cheerful always a good sign
