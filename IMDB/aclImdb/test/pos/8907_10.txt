like so many other reviewers on here my memories of this show are universally warm in fact so fond are said cherished memories that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood whereby i used to sit utterly mesmerised as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey pigsy sandy tripitaka and later yu lung a horsedragonman youll really need to watch it to understand when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday evenings as i recallbr br well im pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult ie more cynical eyes the show has lost none of its inimitable charmbr br simply wonderful entertainment from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects which actually serve to heighten the fun and of course not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season the passing of time has not in any way shape or form diminished any of monkeys spellbinding charmbr br as monkey himself would probably say oi you there go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun
