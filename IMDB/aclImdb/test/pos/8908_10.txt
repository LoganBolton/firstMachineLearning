easily one of the best shows ever made  it just gets better with agebr br for me  one of the chief reasons for this was the english adaptation done by david weirbr br a japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in its original language was more whimsical  less flatout hilarious that the version we all knowbr br the fact that the show resonates so strongly for its nonjapanese fans is  i think largely because of mr weirs inspired efforts  some winning voiceover workbr br well done sir
