with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter wyngardes jason kingbr br most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character hes far more nuanced than thatbr br jason king is lazy he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end he is egotistical his appreciation of people is based on whether theyve read his novels or not a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is rightand she often is hes clearly a man having a midlife crisis and drink drives butjason king is brilliant if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldnt have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger led by his libido love of finery and prone to grandstanding and it gets in the way of his detective work at times but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing him as whiterthanwhite the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for itbr br watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king
