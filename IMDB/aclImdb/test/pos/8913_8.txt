there is more to this movie than meets the eye if youre looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy youll be disappointed but for an entertaining 90 minutes this is just finebr br the cinematography is careful and precise the sex scenes which one comment decries as gratuitous are anything but  every gesture contributes to the development of the charactersbr br yes some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light without being sensationalistic at least not for early 21st century urban standards and there are many very amusing moments
