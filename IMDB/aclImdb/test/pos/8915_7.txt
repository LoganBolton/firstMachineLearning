why do i give this 1974 porn movie 7 points because i watched it and i found it hilarious aliens their weird spaceship their weird helmets my god was that a sight and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earthbr br and where do they look for it in upper bavaria germany and that is where the main fun comes from in europe and more so in germanspeaking countries bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women well there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the american pie seriesbr br but what this film achieved is a true funny weirdness you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas but it was 1974 and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia youve never seen a film like thatbr br and if you dont mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts watch it once it is a comedy essentially not a porn flick
