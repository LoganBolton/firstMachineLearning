if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isnt it if youre looking for a comedic masterpiece this isnt it if youre looking for something hardcore this isnt itbr br that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early  mid 1970s this is itbr br i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974 yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllablesbr br if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80s and recently 90s adult stars the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the driveins in the late 1970sbr br i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax many people become upset when later in life it doesnt live up to their previous memories its understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays eroticabr br if you compare 2069 to a modern softcore erotic comedy you may be disappointed the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very littlebr br it is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european eroticcomedic cinema of the 1970s
