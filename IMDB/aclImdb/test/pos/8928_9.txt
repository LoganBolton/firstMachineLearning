this film was incredible looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an indie the most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by david beazely mark hildreth and paul anthony who plays the main role he carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth br br the cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly it wasnt very realistic in that way but it didnt have to be to make a larger point it was really great seeing alan cumming in this too the script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting ive seen in a whilebr br go see this
