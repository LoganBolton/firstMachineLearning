like night stalker and then xfiles the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out unlike these the heroes werent left holding an empty bag at the end they had usually tangible results it was also made clear that the good guys were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things imagination wit acting which didnt always take itself too seriously  i miss it one reason being im hard pressed to think of too many shows  banacek aside  which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet for all that still made sense too i agree with another reviewer that the anabelle character was somewhat underused but when she was on screen it wasnt just for eye candy she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it a rarity in those days sullivan if he wasnt in the department hed be working for the kgb or cia hes that sort of coldly efficient ruthless type he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done king its clearly a game to him one he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detectivespy novels he writes as his ostensible real job hes probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too i do agree that the eventual spinoff series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original however
