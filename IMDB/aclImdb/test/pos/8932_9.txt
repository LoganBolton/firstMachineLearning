i have seen this film on a sunday evening and i must say there is no better way to end the weekend i am totally pleased with the humor and the warm charm this film offers it simply leaves me in beautiful mood watching this film means having a great time and keep a warm feelingbr br the film offers sharp black british humor and feels very fresh to me you really enjoy the story and the characters brenda blethyn is so great i dont know exactly why shes too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother but i really feel comfortable when she shows up in the moviebr br some may say the story was thin and predictable but who cares there simply has to be a happy end dancing in the sunshine are the characters stereotypes or cut outs i dont know better i dont care i just loved them and enjoyed watching thembr br furthermore i must say that i usually dont like romantic comedies but this one is outstanding a black comedy with a heart of gold
