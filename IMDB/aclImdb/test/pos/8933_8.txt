ive been wanting to see this movie for a very long time i eventually just bought it on ebay since its so hard to find stateside but the wait wassomewhat worth itbr br i cant say the movie was great and i cant say that the movie was hilarious but it was good and it has some pretty funny points that aside the shots in this movie are just beautiful and the entire cast especially brenda blethyn someone i hadnt seen before sadly were excellentbr br in the end this is a feel good romantic comedy and i recommend checking it out unless youve just had a death in the familybr br if anything the final chapter is highly worth the money
