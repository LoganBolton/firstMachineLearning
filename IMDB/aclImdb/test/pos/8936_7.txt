watching plots with a view called undertaking betty in the us i got the feeling that there need to be more movies filmed in wales this one portrays a woman brenda blethyn in a small welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband so she and the funeral parlor manager alfred molina come up with a planbut there are likely to be some glitches along the waybr br i would actually say that christopher walkens character is the neatest in the movie how could he not be but overall the whole idea is just a really neat one stacked with some uh oh momentsespecially the haunted house scene its the sort of movie that i wish that i could enter just to experience itbr br also starring lee evans naomi watts and miriam margoyles
