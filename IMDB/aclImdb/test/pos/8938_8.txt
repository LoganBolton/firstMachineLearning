viewed this the other night on cable ondemand and thought this is the type of movie that might have starred alec guiness and glynis johns if it had been made in the late 50s a farce in the english tradition alfred molina and brenda blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portrayals naomi watts simply sizzles in a ditzy jayne mansfieldish if she could have acted way rest of the cast have some great turns and bits the welsh landscape is delightful an absurd premise indeed and not at all believable but that doesnt get in the way of enjoyment not a great movie mind you but a truly fun watch and walken is at his wacky best a joy to behold
