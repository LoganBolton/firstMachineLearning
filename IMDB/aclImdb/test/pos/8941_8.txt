this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it so if youre not a fan of dry humor dark humor or backhanded humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is quirky with some nice twists and a flowing natural dialogbr br the story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the intrigues are plenty the twists are enough to fully engage the senses and the characters are downright lovablebr br i had a great time with this moviebr br it rates an 8310 frombr br the fiend
