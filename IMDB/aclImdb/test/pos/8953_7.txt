this was the film that started that the cinematic love affairbr br between the jaundiced eye crew and matthew ferguson hisbr br ability to portray relatively normal characters like birkoff inbr br la femme nikita is counterbalanced by his equally deftbr br handling of weirdos like kane one wishes that he would onlybr br be given more roles bigger roles and other even more complexbr br roles to assay to push the limits of his abilities there werebr br four or five memorable scenes in this film and matthew fergusonbr br stole two of them from far more experienced actors this filmbr br itself is good and it is worth watching on its own merits butbr br ferguson makes it a little extra special his ouevre maybr br eventually show what the career of anthony perkins might havebr br been like if he hadnt been typecast as norman bates so longbr br ago kane isnt quite as whackedout as norman and far fewerbr br people saw love and human remains than saw psycho so we canbr br hope that ferguson will show us some hint of what perkins mightbr br have been able to accomplish had he been allowed to do so
