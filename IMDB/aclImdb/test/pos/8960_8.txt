yes this film has many gay characters it also has straight characters characters who are not sure about their sexuality people who are searching for some truth about their existence br br this is not a film about sexual orientation its about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another filmically denys arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting constantly shifting relationships the serial killer element is a bit less successful it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and unlike the rest of the film is thematically heavyhanded br br thomas gibson centers and grounds the film its a quiet performance but behind the handsome arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him the supporting cast is strong especially mia kirshner as gibsons friend a domforhire with precognitive powers her role is more metaphor than a literal conceitstrangely innocent and depraved at the same time she represents the light and dark of the characters sexual consciousness br br the films involving and often surprises in its character development the effect is somewhat like robert altman directing a david mamet scriptthe dialogue doesnt shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning often in our search for love and a conventional relationship we ignore the love that already exists around usin our friends family those who are able to see us as we are arcand and the writer brad fraser make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected waysbr br this film is a rewarding experience it may not be for bigots who cant get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater transcendental message of hope and redemption loneliness is a universal experience a film like this that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye deserves applause and an openminded approach
