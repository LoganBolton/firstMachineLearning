charlie wilson tom hanks is a hardpartying womanizing texas congressman with no discernible legislative record in 1980 he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of afghanistan which is in the midst of a brutal war with the ussr on the auspices of his old flame archconservative texas socialite joanne herring julia roberts he travels to afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees he returns to the us determined to help the afghans only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation  and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use undeterred wilson recruits herring and the vulgar outcast cia agent gust avrakotos phillip seymour hoffman to begin a convoluted arms deal involving israel egypt pakistan saudi arabia and a mostly unknowing us congress ultimately the afghans defeat the soviets but while america celebrates their victory wilson and avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of postwar afghanistan falling on deaf earsbr br charlie wilsons war is slick brain candy a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average filmgoer the movie assembles an astonishing array of talent both in front of and behind the camera and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time the films has only one flaw which well arrive at later as an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th centurys largest covert war was waged  and perhaps the way that things get done by the cia and other intelligence agencies  its fascinatingbr br the movie is interesting on a number of levels the story portrayed in the movie  with all of its outrageous doubledealings sneaky covert operations and perhaps most of all its success  would be so outrageous as a work of fiction that it could easily be dismissed as a satire but things really did work out this way at least within reasonable bounds the film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices even embracing them  yet willing to embrace a righteous cause herring is something of an elitist and her bornagain attitude of righteousness is offputting  yet shes deeply committed to the cause of the afghan people avrakotos is a cia outsider with an attitude problem looked down upon because of his street background  yet his love of country and hatred of communism are unwavering the fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the ussr is not only proof that anyone can make a difference but also that truth is stranger than fiction its also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy  not too surprising given that our writer is aaron sorkin but its an interesting way to approach this storybr br the movie does however have one drawback which is a bit surprising the film seems to unabashedly celebrate wilson and cos achievement this is fine  nothing wrong with defeating the soviet union is there  until one considers that out of the ashes of the soviet defeat in afghanistan came the taliban and eventually alqaeda regardless of the uss level of responsibility it happened and the movies portrayal of wilsons success is almost unmitigated to be fair the movie does address this issue towards the end with a rather topical speech by wilson about the uss inability to clean up after themselves but its done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it the overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the afghans defeat the soviets this isnt a fatal drawback mind you but its one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie br br the films talent is remarkable the legendary mike nichols delivers a slick gorgeouslooking production the material is perfectly suited to his understated wry directorial style sorkin delivers yet another brilliant screenplay the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic sorkin exchanges the best being the scotch bottle discussion between wilson and avrakotos and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it the films cast is a marvel tom hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause julia roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed joanne and phillip seymour hoffman steals every scene par usual as the abrasive gus the alwayslovely amy adams takes another step on her road to stardom as wilsons long suffering assistant and ned beatty om puri emily blunt christopher denham and ken stott flesh out the supporting castbr br charlie wilsons war is an intelligent and fun movie a wonderful bit of abitmorethanlight entertainment the fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldnt be held against it its brilliant at what it doesbr br 810
