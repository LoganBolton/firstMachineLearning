great film a very worthy 710br br tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the 80sbr br this film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved ie ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten aboutbr br this film was good it was a well deserved 710 it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isnt your thing
