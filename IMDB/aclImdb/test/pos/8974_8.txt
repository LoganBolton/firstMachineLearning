nice to see a comedy for grown ups masterfully structured by aaron sorkin via mike nicholss own mastery mr nichols mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in whos afraid of virginia woolf to the sad and riveting julia roberts clive owen jude law and natalie portman in closer in charlie wilsons war the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks julia roberts philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else its personal only to a point hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness amy adams witnesses and exist as a character witnessing an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount beautifully it is philip seymour hoffmans gus with a t however that monopolized my attention his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us someone who survives the disregard with which hes treated by the absolute conviction that hes smarter than all of them put together hoffman is superb the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions a sharp short smart sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that
