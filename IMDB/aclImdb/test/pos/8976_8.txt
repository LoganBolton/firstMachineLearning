in one of the better movies of the year tom hanks stars as congressman charlie wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant given reasonably current events historical comedydrama surrounding the 1980s afghansoviet fiasco the soviets were attacking afghanistan killing hundreds of people why should anyone care people are dying right no the reason the united states got involved through charlie wilson was because the afghans in fear they would get blown to sht started illegally coming into pakistan which in turn pssed pakistani president mohammad zia ulhaq off charlie wilson in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in texas joanne herring julia roberts and a amusing and robust american spy for the cia gust avrakotos philip seymour hoffman to help supply afghans with hightech weapons to destroy soviet fight aircraft that would try and attack their landbr br although certainly not a serious oscar contender for best picture charlie wilsons war is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year academy award winner mike nichols provides solid directing as to be expected while emmy award winner aaron sorkin sports night the west wing provides a remarkable screenplay that nearflawlessly balances comedy and drama the acting is great for the most part as well tom hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 oscarnominated turn as a fedex worker stranded on a tropical island in cast away hanks takes a slimy character like wilson and with his trademark charm turns him into a likable guy amy adams and ned beatty are reliable as always but the real standout performance of the film is from philip seymour hoffman arguably the finest actor working in the film industry today hoffman takes a small supporting role and upstages everyone around him from his first scene where hes screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window hoffman sucks you in the only disappointing cast member is unsurprisingly overrated hollywood starlet julia roberts hamming her way through yet another movie roberts overbearing and overthetop portrayal of a rich texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is at most times flatout annoying at 97 minutes the movie is short and sweet and that isnt to say it doesnt drag at some points but when it does drag its for a very brief amount of timebr br in conclusion charlie wilsons war is not a perfect film by any means but its certainly worth a look grade b
