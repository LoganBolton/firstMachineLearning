the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glorybr br thats reason enough for mebr br she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films huge mansion near the jungle hunters staying around for parties when they arent out hunting zebras and said parties becoming drunken orgiesbr br all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes and emanuelle beds most of thembr br joe damato did not direct this one he just ripped it off and used the same casts and did anyone notice the subliminal sexual images at the gas station and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes br br coherence hardly any but goddess gemser is beautiful
