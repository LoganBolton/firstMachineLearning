told in flashback the film opens in 1989 with charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of communism i must admit my heart sank as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest somewhat boring and overlong life story how wrong was i because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boringbr br the film is full of entertaining  amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places the next scene after the awards ceremony is charlie in a hottub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a tv programme another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises charlie a group of his rather sexy secretaries phillip seymour hoffmans cia man and a bottle of whisky as to dialogue what about this for a line the senator says he can teach us to type but cant teach us to grow tits ok schoolboyish i know but the film is laced with great linesbr br as to performances well phillip seymour hoffman as usual steals every scene hes in hanks is ok but surprisingly to me anyway was julia roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric texas oil millionairessbr br charlie wilsons war is one of the best non musician biopics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains amuses as well as informs all in equal measure
