mike nichols in finest form i was not a fan of closer so its refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but nichols and his very strong alist cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling congressmanbr br philip seymour hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant  here playing a damaged but ultrasmart cia manipulator and it is in the exchanges between hanks and hoffmans characters where the comedy soars rarely is movie humour laughout loud and also smart this hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world often simultaneouslybr br one other major plus is the length of the picture the film is based on george criles fat book of the same title the temptation for screenwriter aaron sorkin his claim to fame is the west wing must have been to make a fat movie but what we get is a breathtaking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implicationsbr br this film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of its sparkling witty script  even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that herring and wilson provide and the ultimate consequences 911
