peter lorre turns in one of his finest performances as a hungarian watchmaker coming to the united staes to make a new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him lorres infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face hideously burned in a hotel fire and when no one will give him a chance to work turns reluctantly to a life of crime lorres range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his jovial goodnatured immigrant to his depressing melancholic disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed america afforded him to his suave intelligent betterthanyouraverage hood to his sympathetic dealings with a blind woman with whom he falls in love the story is wellpaced has some interesting twists and gives lorre many opportunities to shine director robert florey does a quality job behind the lens and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn keyes giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl i loved the ending  and the truth  that was shone to exist in lorres character despite all the negative things society had done toward him for a little b picture the man behind the mask is good moviemaking for its time
