young warriors 1983 br br while this is a deeply flawed and in some ways idiotic movie the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fanbr br meet yuppie college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies in what starts out as a particularly egregious teen sex comedy we follow this bunch of jerkoffs and their antics which involve among other things making pledges tie bricks to their genitals the movie abruptly shifts gears when kevins high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do when she dies in the hospital kevin vows revenge much to the chagrin of his detective fatherbr br so far weve gone from porkyslite through last house on the left territory into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick however kevin and his gangs portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become killcrazed lunatics its to the films credit that it doesnt glamorize the fascist anticrime rhetoric that kevin continually spouts while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he doesbr br the mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly and by the end its so over the top and exploitative that itll leave you incredulous and thats the strength of this film you never know what to expect nextbr br at over 100 minutes its a little lengthy for this kind of fare but you wont get bored poorly acted for the most part with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue this wont be topping anyones list of forgotten classics anytime soon i got a kick out of it though and im sure anyone reading this knows if theyre up for it
