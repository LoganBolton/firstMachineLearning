now i realize that most people on here trash young warriors or hail it as so bad its funny type entertainment but let me make something clear its actually a quality piece of low rent action if youre willing to watch such cinema without a critical eye in fact its a good deal more entertaining and thought provoking than the bulk of the action films of the 80sbr br the key is in the films subject matter im always a sucker for movies that tackle the subject of vigilantism especially when they ambitiously probe into the psyches of the characters involved young warriors may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first death wish film and yes i do think the first one had both of those elements but its trying to be different from the runofthemill cannon films of the period in that its genuinely uniquebr br the plot is simple dont worry there wont be spoilers a group of college student pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is assaulted by a tough street gang the students take to the streets in an effort to combat general street crime being that they dont know who the gang responsible is they eventually acquire some heavy artillery machine guns and grenades and prowl the night fully armed however these are not schwarzenegger types theyre vulnerable inexperienced novices who make sizable blunders nearly each time they set out to clean up the city usually with their frat mascot dog in tow they finally figure out who the gang is and go after them but by then you wont be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys walk away unscathedbr br one thing about the film that struck me as strange yet effective is that the bulk of the first act offers no indication that well be seeing any action or violence later on as its treated like a goofy frat comedy youd see on usas up all night where i believe this was actually shown at one point the comedy setup actually lulled me into forgetting that the vhs cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back then when the violence finally arrives its not fun or cute at all its shockingly disturbing from that point on the film becomes a full blooded uncompromising action yarn containing some startling gunfights and gorebr br the acting while nothing special is far more impassioned than i anticipated james van patten who plays the protagonist gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie the rest of the cast is equally invested including the always dependable ernest borgnine as the heros cop father the cinematography is also above par and the action scenes are handled with a level of severity that i personally wasnt expectingbr br i can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated but those facets struck me as nothing short of cool in and of themselves van pattens character is studying animation and his patently early 80s style work thats on display in several scenes is a retro film lovers psychedelic wet dream im sure most contemporary viewers would cite those very moments as low points in the movie but i disagree also joe walshs soundtrack  which sounds like it could have only been recorded in 83  seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable regardless of how old it seems todaybr br young warriors is one of my favorite action films of the 80s and i highly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look sadly however its only been released on vhs as of this writing and it isnt being shown on tv these days a nice dvd presentation would make me moonwalk around my living room with such intensity that im sure my ankles would swell in the meantime i implore you all to go on ebay or amazon and cough up the ten bucks or whatever for the old bigbox tape it really is a remarkable staple of ambitious trash cinema
