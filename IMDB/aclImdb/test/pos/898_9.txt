i have so much hope for the sequel to genx luckily my hopes have came true you got a whole bunch of action comedysilly comedy and surprises i think the newcomer edison is really a hit in the movie but i really find sams alien stupidly annoying with english although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong the action setup is much stronger than the 1stbr br this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60 of the movie is in english from the cantonese this movie will not disappoint you i recommended this for young uns that care about pure actionpacked funbr br
