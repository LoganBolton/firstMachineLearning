first lets call this movie what it isbr br 1 its a feelgood movie with a messagebr br 2 the acting is just okay dialog slightly better production value pretty goodbr br 3 rugby scenesjust barely passablebr br but heres the trick this isnt something hollywood contrived and it isnt trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport it is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people in real circumstances and a real storyline sure they could have done a better job actually reping the sport but my vote it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to dobr br and fwiw i cant think of many football baseball hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either cmonbull durhambr br im not a rugby player i was a wrestler but i graduated from highland attended 8690 and occasionally trained with the rugby guys my brotherinlaw david however was one of the original founding members of the highland rugby club in 1976 his younger brother billy played the next year as i recall if youre interested theres a highland rugby site at highlandrugbynet that addresses the history of the team br br by the time i was there the club had been in existence for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence its a fact that they focused on broad training topics devotion honor discipline effort not tactics i thought the rugby guys i knew were a little off in the head but i think i might have just been a little jealous they were hardcore dedicated to the belief system that gelwix promotedbr br with regard to the cultural mixing issues that have been brought up it might be interesting to note that while i was there in the 80s one of the larger schools in the city was shut down  south high school  and its students distributed among the other 3 primary slc schools to be honest highland pre80s was pretty whitebreadive got a picture of the team from i think 1977 that shows an all white club south high on the other hand was a much more racially integrated school before it closed i had a pair of friends from south who joined the team one tongan one samoan and as i recall there were a bunch of islandnation players that joined up 8890 i dont think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting maori or other cultural traditions if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys its that they walked the walk br br and as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschoolage teams in the world yeah its true that usrugby on average when taken as a whole does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere there are exceptions but hey  its a simple fact that rugby doesnt have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the us that arise in other countriesbr br with that said judge highland on its merits br br  the only team to qualify for the usa rugby national championships every year of that organizations 25yr historybr br  a win record of 392 wins 9 losses read that againwinningest coach in any us sport in historybr br  regular international tours br br  some compelling wins against some legitimate international teamsbr br are they the world best maybe some years probably not mostbut theyre pretty good on a consistent basis and its disrespectful to the game to blow them off when highland rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the us
