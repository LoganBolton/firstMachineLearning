i think a several of americas baseball movies are among the best movies ever made when this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie id read about the highland team in the newspapers but didnt have high expectations for this film about a sport that didnt interest mebr br last night i viewed it ondemand and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job neil mcdonough was especially convincing as the bad dad he displayed fine range and a subtle but moving character arcbr br i also enjoyed the pacific islander actors ive been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture a flashback showing how the islander culture became such a key element of highlands team would have been a excellent addition to the filmbr br some pretty tacky movies have been shot in utah recently its good to see a quality film like this from the beehive state
