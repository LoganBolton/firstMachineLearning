geny copssince i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved genx cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didnt return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own waybr br stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match who has a steady girl in oli note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse asedison i also enjoyed paul rudds performance of agent curtishe seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth fbi agent youd love to hatebut soon youd like his characterbr br the fight scenes are a lot better in this oneeven though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky libr br look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match smoorenburg also is the stunt double for ruddbr br if you liked genx copsyoull love geny cops
