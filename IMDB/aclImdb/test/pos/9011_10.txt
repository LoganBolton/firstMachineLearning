its not as good as the movie that said its a cute kids show okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie earth kitt who has been in numerous films but im sure many people know as catwoman and patrick walburton sorry if i misspelled who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the tick its really a rare and wonderful combination if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo to sum up entertaining childrens show with plenty of inside jokes for the grownups to laugh along with if your looking for educational value this isnt your show if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick
