ive never been compelled to write a review about anything but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something first people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different once you watch an episode it never really comes to mind ever again the humor is original and while yes some jokes do carry over from the movie they are delivered fresh some of it is even reminiscent of shrekselfreferential humor a lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger patrick warburton and eartha kitt are both hilarious as they reprise their roles as kronk and yzma and their annie award nominations were wellwarrantedbr br this show takes some time to love to really get in the groove of things so to speak if you ignore the horrible theme song which really shouldnt warrant that much in the way of how you judge a show since its only 30 seconds of the overall product this show is laughoutloud hilarity and doesnt lose any of the emperors new groove spirit
