original movie lovers can actually love this show if they just stop complaining all the timebr br the emperors new school brings up some old jokes from the movie like pulling the lever to yzmas lab and kuzco pausing the episode but since its a kids show its just classic and is in their right places even though the style is much more simple the animation and characters keeps their personalities very well and it surprised me actually eartha kitt makes excellent voice acting for yzma and jp manoux does a wonderful job for kuzcos voice instead of david spade who played kuzco in the movie great plots hilarious moments and kuzcos amazing looks makes this show worth watching just stop complaining about everything
