while i understood that this show is too weird to please everybody i dont get where all these bad reviews come from and im most surprised over the bad reviews that it has gotten from fans of the movies i liked it and got hooked on it since the first episode i watched its a little messed up though that kuzco was put into school and it seems to be high school rather than college but i guess hes only eighteen right so its not like hes too old to get educated and havent the royals always had to get the best education avaible to them so the kuzco has to graduate or he wont become emperor thing doesnt sound too weird for me and i guess his education was neglected before so thats why he has to be educated now
