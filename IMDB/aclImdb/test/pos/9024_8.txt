this is a great film for pure entertainment nothing more and nothing less its enjoyable and a vaguely feelgood moviebr br a minor but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we dont know why justine and chas broke up okay most first relationships dont work for one reason or another but they more or less seemed like a nice couplebr br in a nutshell its worth a watch to escape reality
