i really cant see why people seem to dislike this film i found it very entertaining of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura fraser is a bonus when i first heard about it i thought it would be along the lines of a rolereversed weird science and to an extent this is true however there is a twist which i really didnt see coming having seen the trailer on the dvd which i hadnt seen before watching the film i saw that the twist is actually shown in the trailer very strangebr br as the film progresses the weird science comparison fits less and less and i think this is the better of the two films certainly there are some scenes which dont work wonderfully but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young castbr br in summary id suggest that this is a fine example of a scifi chick flick and i dont think ive seen many of them
