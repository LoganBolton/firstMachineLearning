this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews its title and the first ten minutes lead you to expectbr br the plot is very silly but this adds to the lighthearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genrebr br unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongueincheek silliness and dont mind suspending your disbelief
