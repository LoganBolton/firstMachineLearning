i am not a faulkner fan which is considered sacrilegious especially since i grew up near the authors hometown however i think this is an excellent movie on par with the quality of the movie to kill a mocking bird if you havent seen it buy it anyway its well worth having in your permanent collection tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series i wish theyd play it more often very movingbr br on a side note the folks from oxford mississippi will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940s the courthouse city hall etc theyre all on screen i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings when i saw the arch in the front of city hall i began to get suspicious look closely at the pennants on chicks wall youll see two for ole miss
