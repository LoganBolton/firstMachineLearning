hello there i would just like to say how much i enjoyed your review and comments about that excellent film intruder in the dust i believe that the points you made were insightful intelligent and totally valid its also a shame that this film is hardly ever shown on tv these days and that it isnt available on dvd region 2  i live in england once again many thanks for your review the actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant film young man with a horn which also starred kirk douglas and lauren bacall that was a very evocative and stylish film with some superb music i wish that someone with influence could release the entire back catalogues of films like johnny belinda i remember mama and the yearling on dvd region 2 we love these movies in great britain im not of pensionable age im still reasonably young and my family and i love classic filmsfilms like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories anyway many thanks for your comments
