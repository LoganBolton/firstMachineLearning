take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail theyre not the faces of hollywood extras somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford mississippi because you cant get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot scope out the narrow dusty roads the frozen earth beneath and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving theyre just reflecting the soil from which they spring old man lucas hernandez better fear for his life but then he springs from that same hard earthbr br the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense old man lucas is not very likable hes a victim and we sympathize but hes also haughty and unfriendly wisely the script refuses to sweeten him up that way were forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective instead were shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death so its through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed a much more effective pathway it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow systembr br note how the movie doesnt attack segregation its doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and theres no hint that even lawyer stevens brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done no the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid jarman whose head is not yet filled with notions hes not exactly friends with lucas but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle the lawyer instead of his more hidebound parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march but the kid might thats the movies realistically hopeful sidebr br there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period 194951 the well no way out home of the brave lost boundaries even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem unfortunately the mccarthy purges in hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve cold war ends even so each of these is worth catching up with not only because theyre good movies but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow theyre still relevant
