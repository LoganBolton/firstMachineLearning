this is a well done action movie there are plenty of fight scenes the acting is convincing for this genre and rs1 is awesome i dont know why people feel compelled to trash rs1 i thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great the plot was acceptable for a martial arts moviebr br having said that i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched at least rs1 had the right idea by killing him now for all of you who thought sam lee alien was a bad actorhe wasnt meant to be taken seriously i have just had the pleasure of watching genx cops prequel and sam lee played the same character the same waybr br now please all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners do not judge this is a thinking mans movie it isnt supposed to require thought just meant to be enjoyed thats all i hope they make another soon
