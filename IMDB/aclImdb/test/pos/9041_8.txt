no movie could ever do justice to faulkners command of the english language but they did a pretty good job here lucas beauchamp is exactly the way i pictured him in the book as is chick what the movie couldnt really go into was how beauchamp wasnt liked by the negro people either because he was equally as stubborn not that it is a bad thing but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world yet i got the feeling it was white societys racism that started it and it spilled over into negro society until that became his attitude toward everyonebr br the best part of the movie is that you get to see yoknapatawpha county actually oxford mississippi exactly as faulkner wrote about it the film was made when faulkner was alive and writing it doesnt look that much different today because of this alone the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in faulkners backyard a true must see for faulkner fans
