this is easily the best cinematic version of william faulkners fiction that ive ever seen and ive seen several of the most prominent ones filmed in faulkners hometown of oxford mississippi it really captures the feeling of jefferson and yoknapatawpha county intruder in the dust is not one of faulkners best novel but even if it is a clich√© to say this it would be the crown jewel in any one elses career it beats harper lees good but simplistic to kill a mockingbird fifty feet into the ground i read that one in ninth grade and thats exactly where it belongs two of faulkners most prominent characters play major parts in the film gavin stevens and lucas beauchamp stevens is probably the single most common character in all of faulkners fiction hes a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator because unlike many of his other characters stevens is a man of logic not emotion at least when hes older lucas beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of faulkners black characters he plays a major part in one of faulkners outandout masterpieces go down moses unlike all of the other black folks in yoknapatawpha he refuses to bow down to any white man he has pride and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man one day lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recentlyfired pistol in his possession most of jefferson and the surrounding areas dont see the need for a trial and everyones pretty sure that beauchamp will be lynched before the evenings over or at least the next day as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday beauchamp on the other hand declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him stevens refuses the case seems open and shut but his young nephew chick mallison because lucas had helped him in the past is willing to help him nowbr br as far as i know no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one hollywood films rarely persecute the black population but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles if youre an african american actor you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy the maid the servant or the porter because thats the only way youll work in intruder in the dust there is to be found one of the most memorable nonporter roles a black actor ever had lucas beauchamp and beauchamp as i described above is no stereotypical character and might have been hard for audiences to accept even today black characters are usually simple magical and kind the recent arthouse hit far from heaven is a great example of that beauchamp is kind of a jerk and hes very stubborn although hes perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel hes not any kind of stereotype hes a complex human being juano hernandez plays beauchamp extraordinarily well i havent seen the film in a while but he also appears in robert aldrichs 1955 film kiss me deadly as well as the cinematic adaptation of faulkners final novel the reiversbr br all the actors are great in the film i should also praise quickly claude jarman jr who has the great role of chick mallison the novel takes place from his point of view and he is the conventional hero of the picture jarman is quite an actor he captures the character who also appears elsewhere in faulkners fiction narrating for example events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel the town perfectly he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film rio grande the only other film of clarence browns that ive seen is national velvet quite a different picture than intruder in the dust his job here is exceptional i really have to credit him with capturing faulkner perfectly other famous faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic the long hot summer filmed in 1958 which i really like despite that or too cold tomorrow filmed in 1972 which i do not like that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of faulkner the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas sirks great 1958 filming of pylon really a different sort of faulkner novel altogether tarnished angels 1010
