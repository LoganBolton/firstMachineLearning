okay ill admit right up front that the inki cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market seen today the hugelipped and very stereotypical inki is not politically correct however the cartoons were wellmade and its a shame they arent released with some sort of explanatory prologue such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd in other words throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history plus inki little black sambo and other racist cartoons are out thereespecially on the internetbr br this inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting at first hes chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a liona lion that is more than happy to make inki his dinner however through all this a weird minah appears again and againand eventually youll see why this bird is so important to the storybr br cute well made and clever i like the inki cartoons plus i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thinskinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks loads of fun folks
