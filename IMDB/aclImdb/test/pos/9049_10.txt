if a joke doesnt offend anybody it isnt funnybr br the inki cartoons are offensive no doubt about it so is rap music get over it i suspect that any sane black person will find the inki cartoons hilarious and that the people who are offended by them white people who still think blacks need their patronizing protection against racist humorbr br seriously the inki cartoons are funny it saddens me that not because anybody is really offended but because somebody might just might be offended i cant buy inki cartoons or the african queen or song of the south on dvd
