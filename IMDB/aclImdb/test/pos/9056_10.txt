i usually steer clear of film festivals and dont enjoy slapstick comedy but i must say that this picture was great i immediately recognized david krumholtz from the tv show numbers and lorraine bracco roseanne arquette and karen black were at their usual best this is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience and me laughing throughout a rather deep rooted plotbr br kudos to mr parness for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect the plot stays intact throughout the film and the comedic relief adds to the message without being laid on so thick as to distort the blending of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tastefulbr br i can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production
