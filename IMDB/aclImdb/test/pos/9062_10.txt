quirky vulnerable raw honest and a treat to watch im not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film i simply wish to congratulate this small film with the great big heart i tip my hat to the filmmaker and its excellent cast if you want to know what happens in the filmthen go see it michael parness writerdirector has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter  suicide with great compassion comedy and empathy i see a great career ahead for mr parness this film works right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender honest moments between david krumholtz and natasha lyonne as with every movie we need to suspend some disbelief yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with its surreal moments i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further mr parness has pulled some wonderful performances from this already talented cast for instance guillermo d√≠az performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving the colossus ralf moeller former mr olympiad as a terrified patientperfect i can go on and onthis independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story the real star here is the brilliant screenplay i look forward to seeing more from writerdirector michael parness
