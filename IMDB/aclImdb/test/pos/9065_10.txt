i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me emotionally spiritually and just plain silly stuff i didnt get caught up in believability in the screenplay or the actors and didnt even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie listening to michael parness talk at the q  a about his idea of the film wanting to see how crazy people or fed up people as he put it fall in love is really interesting i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at its best i like watching david krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor i agree that guillermo díaz really was a scene stealer and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didnt win any awards at the festival i question why that didnt happen i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting unique creative indie films deserve an audience technically watching this film its really beautifully done  the colors are amazing and lastly its one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a film in awhile
