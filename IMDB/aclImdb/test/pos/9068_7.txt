the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in 1940 that meant peter lorre and peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner stephen danel who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of danelbr br only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves danels wife and monkeys monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves getbr br lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrialstrength fashion although the script is not casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes this is a very watchable story but im not sure what niche this movie filled too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film im not sure how this was marketed to theatersbr br i just caught this for the first time on a late nightearly morning tcm showing lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they havent seen it
