im usually wary of movies hovering around the 610 mark on imdb id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like i guess the trick with reviewing is to take an approach of hey if i liked types of movies like these would i give it a higher score than i am about to give it now since i dont like these types of movies then again people judge differently  basing more value on acting or perhaps story or directing anyway landing the plane here i had rented this movie out before and hadnt had time to watch it this morning i didbr br wow see this movie i am personally interested in the paranormalhave read a bit about near death experiences so automatically i was hooked i am unsure about some of the comments here saying that a quality cast here was wasted  i disagree the acting here was superb from all i think this is the only time i didnt mind julia roberts it was good to see 24s kiefer sutherland currently at the time of this review serving a jail sentence for dui and kevin bacon sporting an interesting hair stylebr br overall i liked the direction the atmosphere the acting and the story line most of all particularly the idea of karma and  to quote nelson wright everything we does matters so truebr br 1010
