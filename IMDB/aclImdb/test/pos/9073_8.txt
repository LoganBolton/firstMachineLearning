flatliners left quite a noticeable impression in my head the story is quick paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and at many times quite tense its about five remarkable student doctors notably julia roberts and kevin bacon among whom one of them has devised the mechanism of remaining dead or getting flatlinedfor a few seconds and then coming back to lifebr br the procedure is quite complex involving a plethora of medical knickknacks  injections electric blankets oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms i strongly suspect doctors coined all these words so that they never need to get layed off but funnily they follow the kiss original version for engineers keep it simple stupid extended version for doctors keep it stupid simple philosophy as well at the risk of getting euthanized by some revengetaking doctor reader let me continuebr br so the first guy who gets flatlined hopes to find the answers to life which philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer he hopes to get it answered and become famous through applied science he flatlines for around two minutes and then comes back into our world left quite shaken during death he has a vision of an incident when he was young which left the strongest impression on his life he killed another boy when he was kid by accident and he still feels responsible for itbr br with the success of the first flatliner the others follow suit each of them extending their flatline time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after deathbr br meanwhile monsters from the past and future keep coming back to haunt them after their flatline experience the first flatliner is haunted by a young kid who tortures him when he is alone the second who cameraed all the women he took to bed sees television sets all over playing his videos the third is haunted by a young girl who he teased in school the fourth is haunted by her suicidedead father for whom she feels responsiblebr br all of them are driven insane by these haunting and obsessions and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them the main focus on getting flatlined is that your entire life passes through your eyes at the moment of dying whatever stage that is and you are left mostly with the strongest impressions of life in your mind since they didnt die these strong impressions have somehow resurfaced and have become the focus of their livesbr br all of them somehow come to terms with and extinguish their past demons all of them except the first one who realizes the only way he can move on through life is getting flatlined again during this flatline session he sees himself getting flatlined the first time and also sees the boy he killed trying to kill him this time round the boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so has sought revenge for a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to come back thankfully because most of us like happy endings the boy absolves him of his past and he comes back to life again
