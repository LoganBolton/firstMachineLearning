nostalgia isnt always the best reason to watch a movie more often than not the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult while there are exceptions to this rule its hard to justify owning a dvd of krull regardless of how many insightful the directors commentary may be but stay sharp gen xyers because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisitingbr br one surprise film worth another look is joel schumachers flatliners the supernatural thriller starring 80s popcorn heavyweights keifer sutherland kevin bacon julia roberts and billy baldwin you would think that a stew comprised of this cast the flamboyant flair of schumacher and the Ã¼ber slick eye of cinematographer jan de bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy but calories aside flatliners aint half bad even though its production design is inexplicably overthetop and the photography is achingly over stylized replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller if theres an explanation why flatliners was forgotten it might be because 1990 saw the release of another far superior supernatural thriller jacobs ladderbr br had flatliners been released a year or two after jacobs ladder its likely schumachers flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down commercialized ripoff of adrian lynes nightmarish masterpiece but with these films being released in the same year flatliners enjoyed a different fate tripling jls take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise the passage of time hasnt been as kind to flatliners it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80s brat pack dreck while jl has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic fates aside jl is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame whereas flatliners falls victim to over simplification and hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement comparisons between the two movies is unfair and ultimately overlooks flatliners ability to represent the 80s at its quintessential best released at the end of a decade of shallow excess flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles but in fairness it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at or at least near the top of its particular heap of dreck for intents and purposes its an entertaining walk down memory lane
