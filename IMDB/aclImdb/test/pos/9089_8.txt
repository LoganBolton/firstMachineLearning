this film has a decidedly weird setting taking place in a school thats really old to begin with but it certainly doesnt look like any sterile medical school environment very gothic and atmospheric as for the film itself well ok the premise is a bit farfetched but hey thats why we watch movies isnt it and its less farfetched than some of the garbage thats out these days thats for sure medical students are experimenting with short term death as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like its kind of nice in some cases till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives i hadnt seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that id forgotten just how good it was and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and madeup like cheap hookers ahh the good old days anyway this is a great flick perhaps not for fundamentalist christians but many others may enjoy it 8 out of 10 stars
