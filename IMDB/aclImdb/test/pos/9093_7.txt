the basic premise of flatliners is fairly simple several medical students put themselves at the point of death in order to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact it sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories in todays world where hollywood has to mine foreign markets for the ideas to make a horror film flatliners is one of those rare gems that show hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enoughbr br what separates flatliners from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not stoop to being condescending or arrogant flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained not moralised to in this kind of supernatural thriller the difference this restraint makes is really incredible whats even more incredible is that julia roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play julia roberts the theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience is in force herebr br the subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to intrude on their present time are done surprisingly well the moments when william baldwins character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing that william baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction i am not sure whichbr br kiefer sutherland on the other hand really shines as the lead one really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why unfolds as kevin bacons character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is it becomes clearer what the film is about we can try to change the past as much as we like but its what we do with the present that matters mostbr br another good aspect of flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive elaborate visual effects quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film flatliners did not expend its budget in places where it did not need to much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending simple trick photography or stock footage sometimes the simplest things are the bestbr br if there is a problem with the film its that it feels about ten minutes too short the ending seems more perfunctory than conclusive as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film up so they can bring it out at a certain market time of course many films have been left with sore spots for this very reason so flatliners shouldnt really need to be any different the hundred and fifteen minutes we do get is highly satisfactory though not overly brilliantbr br i gave flatliners a seven out of ten it works well as a date flick or a kind of latenight popcorn film that aside it makes a good reminder that lowbudget horror shows werent always sad pieces of garbage
