this movie is everything a tenacious d fans can hope for director liam lynch partnered with the d is a concoction of epic proportions of course you need to understand the humour and format of tenacious d when i saw it there wasnt too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes this movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that havent familiarised themselves with the musical duo this movie does stay true to its roots for the few of you who have seen the hbo tv series and heard the album they have not forgotten what their audience loves like the tv show people have noticed from the trailer the jb and kg apartment scenes and of course the open mic nights that each tenacious d episode would start and finish with the soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you awaybr br and dave grohl plays a fantastic devilbr br this is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a rocking musical
