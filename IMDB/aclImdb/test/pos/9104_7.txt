very mild spoilers a basic plot outline no real details br br if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in maryland and the only reason i agreed to gowas because it was free i expected a few chuckles but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d not much more then thatbr br the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at jack blacks humble christian origins in a midwest american town the film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass the second half of tenacious d we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled pick of destiny again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face that said there were times it felt a bit long its only 100 minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or missand when they miss they miss bad same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or sothen kept going anywaybr br i will say that the rrating really saved this movie from bombing the ds humor simply couldnt work without cussing sex and drug references but unless youre a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle a bitbut is it worth 9 bucks i dont think so i was tempted to rate it a 6 but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres a 7 seems more appropriate just be sure its your style
