i was lucky enough to win free passes to the sneak preview of pod let me just tell you from just the previews i was excited to see it the movie absolutely rocked what i really liked about it was the fact that jb was in his element with other movies like school of rock he does namby pamby music for kids and families but this music is obviously all hisbr br i took my brother and sister with me to see it and we laughed basically the entire time there are a couple places where i wonder what the hell they were thinking because some items are a little disjointed but for the most part it was great a lot of the time it didnt seem like a lowbudget film so that is a plusbr br what i was most surprised about was dave grohl as satan that is fing hilarious you honestly wouldnt know from seeing the film that that is himbr br i say that if you are a rock fan and are into jb kg andor tenacious d go see the film be prepared for a lot of drug references a lot of four letter words and some skull shredding rock
