when i first heard that jack black and kyle gass would make a movie about their band i was freaking out i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny now that i have watched it i cant really say that these hopes werent satisfied but i think i expected more the movie is full of tenacious ds great music and i really loved listening to all of it there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story at least the first bit i dont like the way the movie ends the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit morebr br overall i think it is a good movie to watch everyone who likes rock music should watch it itll give you a good laugh
