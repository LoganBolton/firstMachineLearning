i love a film that mixes edgeoftheseat suspense laughs style good acting and a bit of selfparody hitchcock consistently carried this off and in le cercle rouge jeanpierre melville does the same i was sorry when this long film ended br br i agree with the english commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic i love french films italian films english films indian filmsand the increasingly rare good american films i also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an american gangster film missed the point completely but i guess its like jazz either you get it or you dont so why waste time trying to explainbr br just see le cercle noir and be prepared to be deliciously entertained
