mevilles caper film is not as good as his most famous movie the deliciously stylish le samourai 1968 i dont even think this is the best example of the muchloved heist subgenre the main thing against the film is its long running time meville has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details he could have told the same story in a relative short time but for reasons that i dont understand the film seems to go on and on still the movie is never boring melvilles direction impressed me and the cast is very good especially alain delon as a very cool master thief the movies mustsee color photography is a great asset and melville uses sound or lack of sound in a very effective manner from a technical standpoint the movie is practically flawless at times one gets the feeling that meville is merely showing off but when someone is as talented as he is one has little reason to complain i still like other heist movies a little bit more jules dassins topkapi 1964 just to name one but there is no denying that this film is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as cool cinema
