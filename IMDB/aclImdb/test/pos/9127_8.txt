le cercle rouge is a very good film though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films in all too many ways the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as rififi and grand slam and many others so while director melville and the actors did great jobs it all seems like a case of déjà vu because of this i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher scorebr br the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together instead of the usual means vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey a career criminal just released from prison both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch apart from that as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached mannersomething relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent yearsbr br overall extremely wellcrafted and worth seeingif you dont mind that it seems a tad repetitive youll see some fine acting direction and a lot of great tension
