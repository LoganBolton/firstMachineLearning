having finally caught up with this masterpiece it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever in its day its french arty underplayed to the point of agony and ultimately downbeat but viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future its also just a bit vacuous pretentious and unsatisfyingbr br others have summarized the story but i dont think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film the lead characters corey and vogel really dont deserve what they get they play square within their code never harm anyone who didnt ask for it and show great courage and initiative moreover corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland friend who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed apparently just because he corey dared to borrow a few thousand francs these are guys who really ought to be due for a break instead things go far worse for them than they really need to within the logic of the storybr br one might contend that this is the whole point that the real villains never get caught that they collude with the police as needed sell out their friends and always come out on top but thats not shown either coreys old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police nor is he shown gloating over his victory in fact after materializing several times when hes needed hes nowhere to be seen at the conclusion leaving a dramatic tension his feud with corey entirely unresolvedbr br nonetheless id say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography its slow deliberate pacing its great deadpan performances its elaborate heist sequence and its encapsulation of the artfilm style of the late 1960s
