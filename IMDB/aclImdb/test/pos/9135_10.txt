jeanpierre melville is a director ive only recently gotten acquainted with i need to see bob le flambeur and le samourai again to fully grasp them but in watching le cercle rouge the red circle supposedly based on a saying in buddhism i realized i was watching as skillful and absorbing a crime film as i had seen in a quite some time though his film has dialog it is mainly to keep the films scenes rolling along adherent to the plot what kept me on the alert even in seemingly mundane scenessequences was the emphasis on the characters movements or behavior patterns melville has his story laid out and he is careful to take his time to tell it this could seem boring to some but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the charactersenvironments over plot br br yet look at each of the four main players alain deleon as corey just released from prison scheming a new heist gian maria volonte as vogel escaping  on the lam from handcuffed custody meets corey by luck yves montand as jansen an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons a friend of vogel and andre bourvil as mattei an experienced investigator who is on the lookout for vogel and on his toes with internal affairs each of these actors plays their parts with precision detachment and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops the heist sequence gives little hints for example like how vogel copsafeel off a female statue while passing down the halls or how jansen takes out a flask and merely has a whiff of the contents and what a dream this guy creates even coreys movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest br br as absorbing and cool the story becomes and as great the skills were to make it happen via cinematographer henri decae the editing and the musical score by eric demarsan its the people on the screen that gain fascination in how they stay true to their natures and ideals not a film to be missed by french newwave enthusiasts and modernday crime movie buffs might want to take the 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of melvilles work a suave piece of filmmaking that still ranks as one of my alltime favorites
