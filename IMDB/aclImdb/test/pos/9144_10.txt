as a huge fan of horror i had given up on the vampire subgenre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and nonthreatening benign and basically weak this was the attitude i brought to a viewing of souls midnight and i am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies armand assante one of my favorite actors of all time was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity br br another thing that interested me is that the central location is the borgo hotel that is cool because and i went back to my high school copy to look this up in dracula the borgo pass is where jonathan harker must pass to get to draculas castlebr br finally my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn cgi thats the one thing great about many lowbudget movies they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many hollywood monstrositiesbr br bottom linethis is better than underworld for sure especially if you are a vampire purest cheers ja
