if you love vampire lore and are a fan of gothic horror then you might want to check out souls midnight i did not know much about this movie before i watched it and i wasnt expecting much but i found the movie to be fun and entertainingbr br starring armand assante as the leader of the vampires simon souls separates itself from other low budget vampire flicks by weaving in the mythology of st george and the dragon in a fun new waybr br im not sure what the budget for this movie was but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effectsbr br if youre up late one night and youre in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then souls midnight is a good choice
