most of the silent films ive seen have been serious in nature so it was fun to see one with a comic touch the setting and some of the scenes for the beloved rogue were reminiscent of 1923s the hunchback of notre dame relative to the paris street scenes and the celebration of the king of fools john barrymore portrays frances greatest poet francois villon in a characterization that ranges quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantically tender that water into wine bit early in the picture was rather amusingbr br it seems that times never change and its interesting to see the movie make a cogent observation nearly a century ago  paris has its fool to reign for one night while everywhere else has one all the time how truebr br the appearance of conrad veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer ive only seen him as major strasser in casablanca oddly one of his very last movies as king louis xi hes a monarch obsessed with astrology crafty but suspicious and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he resembled brad dourifs wormtounge character from the final chapter of the lord of the rings trilogy not exactly exuding the confidence a king of france might be expected to bear which is why the ascendancy of burgundys duke lawson butt seemed all the more plausible until villon rises to the occasion to put one over on both rulersbr br i found it interesting that the use of intertitle cards was exceedingly spare used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story without them though one would have missed a curious nugget it seems villon carried out his exile from paris at the hostel of the lame flea br br the print i viewed was of exceptional quality the very first film presented in a one hundred action and suspense movie dvd set from mill creek entertainment thats saying something for a film thats now eighty years old its great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie loversbr br one question  did it seem like conrad veidts king louis picked his nose on purpose or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room
