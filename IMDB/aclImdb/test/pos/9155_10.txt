i loved this show but then i dont remember ever not loving anything he did starting with americanization of emily a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico gotta love it like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that brands it as a garner product james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stalebr br ps re killing off the main characterbr br if i remember right the good brother was killed off and replaced with the evil twin in an effort to increase the ratings ie make it more like every other western on tv at the time i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it tv without a jimmy g show is missing something
