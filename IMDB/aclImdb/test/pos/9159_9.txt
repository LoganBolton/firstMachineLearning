nbc was putting out a lot of good product when this series came out but none of it was getting viewers at least according to their executives who wisely canceled good shows like star trek  my world  welcome to it because of low ratings nbcs advertisers were getting a bargain from nbcs ignorancebr br this show stands out as the only time james garner wasnt enough to get viewers it is ashame as this show had an excellent support cast from stuart margolin later angel in the rockford files to neva patterson to margot kidderbr br it was set in a 1900 western town garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duties it was small town stuff but it was excellent it wasnt long after this that jim rockford brought garner back to success but for my money this show was good enough it just wasnt in the right time right place or given the right opportunitybr br the show was so good that most of the folks who worked on it also got jobs on rockford
