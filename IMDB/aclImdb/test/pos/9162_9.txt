from the first to the last scene this film is made very realisticallyeven too realistically that sometimes we cant see details in night scenesits dark as real nightin the desertsunshine is so strong as in real desert br br script and actors play are also very realistic shots and episodes are edited not to show things and events effectively to explain them oras many hollywood films do to entertain viewers editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in afganistan camera is set sometimes far from dying solders even the moment when the main character major bandura is shot and killedbr br such method reminds me of masterpieces of italian neorealism and the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as pais√†or the bicycle thiefchronological series of true to life episodes and a few pathetic moments which at first seem to be sudden and illogical but have inner reasonsbr br i think the inner reason of major banduras suicidal death is religious emotionrepentance for innocent peoples deathnot only his accidental killing of family in the village but also death of solders under his commandhe is not depicted as a eager believeron the contrary he is depicted as tactful and responsible officerexactly for this reason his last decisionsto go back to the destroyed village and to turn his back to an armed boy whose family he killedseem an act of repentance br br the russian orthodox choral which sounds at the endevening sacrificeis another contextby which all the film can be seen from this point of view
