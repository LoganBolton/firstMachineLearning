this movie was much better than i expected after a couple of films by will smith that werent that great like i robot he is back to being likable and fun in this one smith plays hitch a date doctor most of the film centers around him teaching albert how to be himself and get a date with allegra cole a rich famous celebrity whom he works with albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or whatnot all hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around allegrabr br during all this hitch meets sara a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men hitch charms her so of course they go out but hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them he doesnt believe in love himself he has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college but he likes sara so keeps going after her saras friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor so sara tracks the doctor down only to learn its hitch so of course she thinks hes a pig then its up to hitch to explain to sara and allegra what he does so they both end up forgivingbr br final verdict good has some laughs and is entertaining i recommend it
