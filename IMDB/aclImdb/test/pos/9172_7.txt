while the date doctor concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre i found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so i ended up liking it a lot more than if itd had just a mediocre plot without many twists will smith does a great job as always acting as hitch the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to win over womenever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend therere plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient overweight gawky asthmatic albert brennman kevin james successfully court beautiful coworker allegra cole amber valetta also when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesnt seem to get she doesnt want him around he finds himself attracted to sara eva mendes  it appears to be a big deal for him so i guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself unfortunately sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in the date doctor who got a seemingly dorky guy like albert together with allegra  especially after playerjerk vance munson jeffrey donovan breaks her best friends julie ann emery heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him when she doesnt realize that he refused to see him still trouble follows and hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship while not being any great help to albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his the acting is good theres a great deal of humor and some other fine points with meaning hitchs character is witty and wise sometimes managing to be both at once true the misunderstanding where the woman is affronted at something the man hasnt truly done why do they always show that as common and irritating  guess it wouldnt have been if it was the 1st not 5th time ive seen it  but the rest of them were completely new i only wish this movie was longer  i remember being able to watch 35 of it while it was playing on a restaurants tv once  but i still approve its definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity
