hitch is a nice surprise a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic hitch takes actors like will smith kevin james and eva mendes into a fun lightasafeather journey that actually had me laughing and yes a little aww how sweetbr br meet alex hitchens will smith aka hitch hes a selfproclaimed date doctor he helps hopeless guys like albert kevin james win guys like allegra amber valletta unfortunately hitch has to deal with sarah eva mendes a gossip columnist bent on breaking the date doctorbr br hitch is actually pretty funny and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun i have to wonder why will smith hasnt made more movies like this his sharp rapidfire delivery is perfect for this genre and his chemistry with mendes and james is wonderful james is a real discovery i have never seen his show the king of queens but he is funny and heartfelt and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hiphop smiths responses to his attempts are hilarious mendes is hot and bouncy not that way geez as smiths perfect match and amber valletta is sweet as allegrabr br hitch isnt perfect its a tad too long and things get too dramatic near the end although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing buts it a great refresher from the cookiecutter romantic comedies that keep littering theaters
