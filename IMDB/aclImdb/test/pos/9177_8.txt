love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love withbr br i have to say its really nice to see will smith in a movie that doesnt have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots there are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body hes just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice he doesnt necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesnt call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous his character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share the kevin james character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way the only character that was a sore spot for me was the mendez character because shes so cold and calculated that its hard to believe that smith could fall for her he must love a challenge i guessbr br now this is the part of the review in which ill make a joke about how i would never need hitch because im such a player but i just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus im still working on a little project so im a little jaded right now whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before but hey theres like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so i guess one more movie having a predictable ending thats been done to almost death doesnt cause much harm i really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you dont need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well im sure if it had turned out that the james character gets the girl after following everything that the smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really wellbr br despite being predictable this is a perfect date movie its sweet its funny and its romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after its over and by some i mean sex
