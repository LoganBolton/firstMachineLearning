this was a movie that at the end i thought now that was an enjoyable 2 hours i hate spending around 20 not including babysitting  for my husband and myself to have that it was ok feelingbr br i think i like will smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero he was well cast in this his character was very likable as was kevin james br br there were several laugh out loud scenes its also a romantic movie so guys if you want to impress the lady in your life take her to this women will like it as much as any chickflick but i wouldnt categorize this as one there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy i think thats one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie it has romance and slapstick i dont usually like slapstick that much but it wasnt overdone and i cant think of any those scenes that didnt deliver laughsbr br i definitely recommend this movie the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was i want to see it again
