i wasnt sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the 21st century but i ended up buying it anyway i still dont understand why it had to be black and white but thats the only negativity i can see about the film and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema not everyone can understand a film like this but its quite rewarding to those who do unlike o homem que copiava the surrealism fits this movie pretty well and the acting is at least as good as that one or other successful brazilian films such as bicho de sete cabe√ßas cidade de deus brava gente brasileira etc br br my only hope is that this gem doesnt get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake its amazing to see how those guys spend zillions of dollars and still cant make a movie thats 1 as good as this possibly lowbudget flick br br bravo to the entire crew 1010
