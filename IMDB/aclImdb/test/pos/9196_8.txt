1st watched 10282007 8 out of 10dirjesus ponce simple sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without a roof over their heads the movie starts with the woman in the storyplayed by isabel ampudiabeing released from prison but we dont know what she was in for or how long she was there she runs across the antihero of the story and her boyfriend played by sebastian haro as hes parking cars for change they shackup together underneath an old dilapidated building with nothing but each others warmth and a small mattress to their possession he is a drug addict who just tries to make it from one fix to another but she has a strange obsessive attraction to him as a person which we eventually accept he also has some sort of sexuallytransmitted disease so sex for them is out of the question but this doesnt appear to be a problem for either of them she loves this man as he is without question and without him having to change which is a rare find anywhere she earns her keep by carrying a bucket around and washing shop windows they eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a feast isabels character dreams of a normal life but doesnt expect it to happen and doesnt expect to fit into that role so doesnt think much of it both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections without giving up much of the story isabels character continues to persevere while the man gets worse and worse in his drug obsession there is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that lifts it up for the masses to enjoy but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between unworldly misfits that keeps you interested until the end
