i was shocked to learn that jimmy caan has left this show does anyone know why i regard james as one of the alltime greats and wasnt surprised he ended up on tv which can be better than the crap you see on the big screen the stories are slick and the camera faster than a speeding bullet mustnt forget the rest of the cast james vanessayumnikki molly josh mitch alsocan anyone tell me why on earth theres a crap theme tune on the dvd sets but elviss jxl remix of a little less conversation is used on the initial nbc broadcasts does it not make sense to use a tune that you would associate with the gambling mecca of america for dvd releases
