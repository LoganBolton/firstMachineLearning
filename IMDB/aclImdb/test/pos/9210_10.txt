very reliable entertainment as las vegas amuses as well as intrigues very light hearted and very much bolstered by josh duhanel i like this television show and i think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurismvoyeurism in this case is very positive and many females in this series are very nice to look atthis show incorporates las vegas legends such as wayne newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the las vegas genre there have been copious depictions of sin city this is one of the better effortsthe producers and directors are lucky to have james caan in the show as he is very much a totally accomplished actor by and large i like the tv show las vegas and i watch it on fridays i watched it on mondays as well but with monday night football i could see why nbc switched it to fridaysnonetheless i like las vegas a lot
