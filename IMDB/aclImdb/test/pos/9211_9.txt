just got into viewing program for the first time recently  the 2hour kidnapping program dont know why i didnt sooner james caan is outstanding and whollybelievable in the role as the chief honcho at the featured 5 vegas complexbr br so often programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or directorbr br that is certainly not the case with this program along with caan all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive and believable the guest actors are wellchosen br br the stories ive seen are interesting and the show presents a good view of the city as wellbr br this is an entertaining program and one i hope will remain i dont know how i managed to miss it for so long but plan to tivo it from now on
