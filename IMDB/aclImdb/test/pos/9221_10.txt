i adored this but i am an 80s kid i loved rainbow bright my whole childhood i dont know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show mine wasnt but thats okay i bought it for me anyway i just brought the little one so the guy at the checkout stand wouldnt look at me funnyi love the non violent drama and the colorful scenery it just reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show  although i may be just a little biased on the subject afterall i was rainbow bright 6 years in a row for halloweeni wonder if they make a rainbow bright costume for adults lol
