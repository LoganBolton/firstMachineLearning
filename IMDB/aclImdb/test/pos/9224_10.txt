people talk about how horrible the script was and how horrible the animation was but rainbow brite and the star stealer really is a japanese anime aimed towards children if you look at the anime today its done in the same style and its immensely popular i dont think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults just as i dont think it was ever intended to be serious the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love rainbow brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion shes smart shes funny she cares about the enviorment she cares about her friends this movie can teach so much to young kids my little brothers even liked this movie i have to say this movie taught me a lot when i was a kid when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it its a great kids movie so what if its not perfect nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough at it
