heres what you have to remember about this movie its a kids movie i dont know about the rest of you but im an 80s child i was obsessed with rainbow brite so naturally i love this movie but if you watch the other rainbow brite movies this one is by far the best but like i said its a kids movie you have to judge it as a kids movie it doesnt matter to kids if the acting animation or script is fantastic or even good all they care about is what happens to the characters if the good guy or girl wins then its a great movie if not then its bad you all know what i mean you were all kids once
