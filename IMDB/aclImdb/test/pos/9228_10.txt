i found this movie on one of my old videos after godzilla vs the sea monster which should instantly give you an idea of its tone and i hadnt seen it in a while so i decided to watch it i didnt remember much about rainbow brite except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute most people feel that way about her you probably do tobr br well when the movie started i wondered if it was the right one it didnt fit the mold of rainbow brite as i remembered her but it turns out she kicks butt this has to be the strangest animated movie ever i cant believe these characters were so popular the series isnt much different while being so bizzare as soon as i watched this movie again it became one of my favoritesbr br i really dont want to give too much away just know that if you see the movie in the video store rent it and watch it no questions asked you will get a kick out of it especially the outrageous princess character and the robotic horse and the hypnotized sprites br br if you cant tell by know this is an 80s cartoon that is really an undiscovered head movie in disguise have fun
