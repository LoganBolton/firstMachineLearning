i wasnt even born when this series was released in the usa it took about another decade before british tv networks laid hold of itbr br in fact i was fortunate enough to see the very first episode in which the lone ranger was one of a posse who ran into an ambush and got slaughtered tlr was the only survivor although badly wounded he was saved by a passing indian called tonto i believe he took to wearing a mask in order to hide his true identity for fear of reprisal but instead he made himself all the more recognisable dunno if he wore it in his sleepbr br this was saturday teatime staple the fanfare bugles of william tells overture presaged a dash to the telly food still in hand though it very quickly became repetitive predictable hokum nobody ever unmasked him nobody ever landed a punch nobody ever outshot him he was a little too good and just a little too camp in his dress for most kids poor tonto on the other hand became his aunt sally he was always getting slugged and tiedup and kidnapped and stuffbr br and what did he keep calling the lone ranger king savvy was the general consensus where i lived it seemed to imply the big knowall in indianspeak but is sounded like something else as if mr silverheels had a speech defect kemosabe what the hells that br br a later and less wellmerchandised duo called the range rider and dick west eventually won my vote this featured a nakedfaced jock mahoney who got beatup pretty thoroughly in each episode and was altogether less camp less super and more believablebr br still even today i cant hear william tells overture without expecting the gallop of hooves and a hearty hioh silverbr br devine daftness
