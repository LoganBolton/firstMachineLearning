in my analysis of trois couleurs blanc i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of trois couleurs bleu i think its the same with this film this time its not because of a tragic comedyelement but much more because of the main character valentine although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous she manages her life with lightness and optimism it seems to me that she might be kieslowskis image for a carefree youth the opposite seems to be the judge who is very pessimistic a grumpy old man who experiences big loneliness in my view valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments they share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one finally i would like to stress irène jacobs performance she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the three colourstrilogy
