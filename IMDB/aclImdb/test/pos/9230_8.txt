bullets may not have bounced off his chest but the lone ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other boyhood hero  superman he represented truth justice and the american way in a classic tv western setting living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill while scouring the american southwest with his faithful indian companion tonto to bring every single outlaw to justice the advent of tv provided the perfect opportunity for a post war generation to find its ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight yearsbr br today i had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story for fans of the ranger this is the grand daddy of all western sagas telling as it does how texas ranger john reid survived the ambush by the butch cavendish gang and how he was nursed back to health by an indian friend from his childhood tonto jay silverheels declares his companion a trusty scout and names him kemosabe ive read various interpretations of the origin of the term kemosabe but im satisfied with tontos explanation reading too much into it just detracts from the story just like the english translation of tonto from spanish which i wont reveal because its just better not to know if you can help itbr br i thought it quite clever how the origin story created the mystique of the lone ranger like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the rangers died in the box canyon ambush you never see the face of the man who becomes the lone ranger as its always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly the voice of the storys narrator describing the wild stallions sterling qualities would that relate say to sterling silver i got the biggest kick out of thatbr br of course with the passage of time watching the lone ranger episodes today offers a view of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the origin story some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy particularly when it comes to a lone ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of its owners hand and how about that little wave he gives to tonto whenever theyre about to ambush the bad guys  its always the same gesture but tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances then you have the episodes where clayton moore takes off the ranger mask to don a different disguise to impersonate another character in service to the story he even went under cover once as an actor portraying president abraham lincoln to uncover a villain top hat and allbr br few fans that i come across ever know that actor john hart replaced clayton moore for the 195253 season in a contract dispute that moore had with the shows producers if you ever saw that happy days episode where fonzie idolizes his boyhood hero youll notice it was john hart listed in the credits its difficult actually to tell if youre watching a hart episode or not the key is to listen to the voice moores is so distinctive that its a dead giveawaybr br if you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes youre in for a treat the renditions ive seen on vhs are absolutely gorgeous although i dont know if commercial prints are available most of the black and white episodes around have been repackaged by any number of distributors in different configurations so getting your hands on those should be no problem the must see of course is the three part origin and if you dont watch anything else this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the wests most famous heroes hiyo silver awaaaay
