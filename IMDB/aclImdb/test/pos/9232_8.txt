someone once defined what is the definition of an intellectual as being a person who can listen to the william tell overture without thinking of the lone ranger in this we heartily concur it surely would be a tall order to accomplish this and one that leopold stokowski arturo toscanini or leonard bernstein would all find nigh well impossible to dobr br and in this there is no disgrace the radio series and the television series along with some movie serials feature films syndicated newspaper comic strip and comic books all did their part to make the masked man of the plains and his faithful indian companion tonto a deeply seeded element of our collective psyche and of our literary folklorebr br as with most legends it all started gradually first with a series of radio plays written for local use in detroit over radio station wxyz the creator was one george w trendle and the principal writer on the series was mr trendles brotherinlaw mr fran striker the year was 1933 when the ranger first rode out to Â…the plains of the early western united states the lone ranger tonto and the radio series all successfully guided depression era americans through the mid and late 30s up to and through world war ii but the postwar era found the country in the midst of a supernova explosion of invention and technology there had been a new communications medium standing ready in the wings but unable to go forth until both ve day and vj day had been achieved once these were accomplished and the world and america was ready to settle down to both peace and prosperity the new technology was of course was television and we would surely need something else than roller derby and wrestling from marigold arena to fill up the broadcast hours and while at first the time that a tv station had anything on except that portrait of that mohican chief test pattern schultz very soon and with post haste the networks began tapping their existing natural resources their existing programming virtually all would be ripe for adaptation to the tv screenbr br so the folks over at lone ranger incorporated were very interested when producers jack chertok harry poppe sherman harris and jack wrather all approached them with a deal to put the masked man and tonto on the television waves as well as the radiobr br immediately they went to work and gave us the first season which made use of the considerable back log of radio dramas all potentially adaptable to tv dramas they cast clayton moore a fine supporting actor in many a feature film and with about a dozen years experience he also had done some work in serials over at republic pictures thrill factory which would be invaluable experience in doing the lone ranger cast as his faithful indian companion and partner in bringing justice to various parts of the frontier we had sheer perfection in charactersupporting actor jay silverheels we must mention that there was that rift in about 53 when clayton moore walked and was replaced with john hart after a season or so mr moore was back inhaving been missed so much now back to our story the first years of filming gave the episodes a look and a sound all of their own they made good use of off screen narrator which gave these shows a feel of authenticity and an individual standout one of a kind series the actors employed were all veterans of the movies of the late silent era thru the 1930s and 1940s a lot of them had been just about exclusively cowboy movie players a good example of these is the casting of glenn strange bartender sam on gunsmoke as the vicious murderous gang leader butch cavandish and it was the cavendish gangs massacre of the texas rangers that led to the origin of john reid thought to have been slain with the other texas rangers as the lone rangerbr br in addition to the old timers in the cast you will find a lot of new and up and coming talent then in the cast we see people like phyllis coates dwayne hickman denver pyle and others in the cast from week to week all of this along with an always calling for fairplay justice and peace in a western worldbr br the last couple of seasons brought some big changes first was the use of colour filming that made no difference as a colour tv set was still a long way off for our household the second was a new set of musical themes and queues other than rossinis finale from u no wutt the new music was never a big deal to us as we preferred the old radio stock stuffbr br with this series and two feature films done during this period the lone ranger warner brothers 1956 and the lone ranger and the lost city of gold united artists 1958 the character has been permanently and indelibly impressed in our identity as a people we americans
