watch this movie its truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie and what happens when it blows up in the film makers face theres a lot of stuff about punk rock and the philosophy behind that movement and its relationship to this project so if youre into old punk american punk youll dig it but beware theres a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated yet they do come off funny at times and actually some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together so anyone out there thats about to make a film especially if you havent been to film school or worked in the field you should watch this and learn from the film makers mistakes
