fascinating look behind the scenes about how a really good movie can get made if the producers director  cast simply refuse to quit these guys encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project miniscule budget trouble with the script and with the script writer so the finished product wasnt what was first envisioned but probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie they set out to make which goes to show that the punk mentality of just do it with or without any backing money or helpfigure it out on the fly and do what you want to do i really liked this documentary movie and know that viewers will see and learn things they didnt know before this movie is truly one of a kindits hard to classify because it has pieces of sci fi and suspense and also how to make a movie it tells the truth about how films get made what can go wrong and how to overcome i especially liked the music written by ed ivey these guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because theyre creative and know how to build props dollys staging lighting with what they can scavenge uppretty amazing stuff
