following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a blockbuster of a tv hour it had always had a sizable hard core of hard corps of followers br br it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street 199399 was a sort of mr inbetween of series it was too big to just cancel but too small to get a case of rabid ratings ravings over br br during the precarious tenure on friday evenings they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas there ive said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious pedantic politically correct preachingbr br when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie br br looking at all the past seasons happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send offbr br our story as we join the story we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer lt al giardello has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but g isnt ready to really retireretire yet so instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of charm citybr br while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an assassins bullet alive but in a comatose state he is taken to the hospital br br news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit weve seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a leadbr br the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now well leave that as classifiedbr br in wrapping up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our endorsement as for grading the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didnt score as high as a typical weekly episode
