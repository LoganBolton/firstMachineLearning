i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the street late in the shows run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of handheld cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface br br homicide the movie the reunion followup to the series is as good as a madefortelevision film can be after lt giardello yaphet kotto now a candidate for mayor of baltimore is shot the series cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv moviebr br vote 9
