master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a womans life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interactionbr br while im not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seenbr br the movie begins a little slow but finds its rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole moviebr br the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and theyre not clich√©d in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesnt get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at leastbr br the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing its one of the best musical scores ever piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to winbr br overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who dont dont miss itbr br how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension
