there are so many episodes that make me howl over the storiesbr br that i wish i could pick the best ones  rocko and bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and bs their way out of hard time just to drag dan into their life of crime br br canadians will notice the odd joke for toronto or the federal government and because the cbc axed a really good show by the frantics that dan was part of  the show takes shots at them and in the episode dans umbrella the cbc is raked across the coals br br when dan says that the cbc would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture  rocko enters the room and gives dan back his tape of fridaynight with ralph benmurgue  this show was a flop and most people wouldnt get the joke unless they knew the cbcs history for making shows people dont watch or axing good shows that they do watch
