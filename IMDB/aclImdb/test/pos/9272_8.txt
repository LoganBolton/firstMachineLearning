remember greg the bunny it was this show that started on the independent film channel but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tvpg material puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe where puppets live in the same world as people and like us take on jobs and lives of their own lets just say if you couldnt handle that then dont bother watching pwk as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of societys good graces through drug abuse hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a halfway house theres plenty of violence sex and bad language so it would never make its way to us network tv as if sociopathic puppets werent enough the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw the government pays for this and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this i dont know where you can get it in the us beyond extra satellite tv but id advise you give it a try really funny stuff it airs on the comedy network in canada
