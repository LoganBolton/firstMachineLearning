i was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite italian directors damato has dabbled in everything from horror postapocalyptic to hardcore porn he has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like buio omega and emmanuelle  the last cannibals this documentary is a lenghty and informative guide to the films of damato he is interviewed throughout with english subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen the excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator with english subtitles the documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored emmanuelle in america here damato explaines the faked snuff scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories in fact good ol joe is very warm and funny throughout always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette the one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on damatos horror films like anthropophagus and the brilliant buio omega it spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the postapocaplyptic films but i cant complain it is wonderful to see damato get the respect he deserves highly recommended for fans of damato may he rest in peace
