despite the previous reviewers screed this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s scifi films that influenced spielberg lucas and others in their more recent efforts i agree that spielbergs films arent even in the same league as the films discussed here such as william cameron menzies brilliant invaders from mars to name just one of the many titles examined but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid scifi yes it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of war of the worlds during the last fifteen minutes you can turn that off the rest is surprisingly good and its nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them even if they cant begin to match the originals
