im totally agree with garryjohal from singapores comments about this film quotation yes nonsingaporeans cant see whats the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually get it its still not quite the truth and as a malaysianchinese i do get it although i dont speak hokkien because we do have the similar problems in malaysia too i know that its really hard to understand and to accept this as a reality but it is definitely not a no real story i was pleased to see this film outside malaysia because it will and definitely be banned in malaysia too which means either you get it in illegal copied vcds or dvds or hope that someone to be kind enough to share it in the internet this is not an another violent teen drama because it portrays the reality which exists in singapore and in malaysia too in an interesting way sadhumour i was just a little sad to know that this film got about 20 cuts in censorship what a waste
