this is the first movie ive seen from singapore and its great if you dont know a lot about asia its languages and its culture then this film may be a bit confusing for the noninformed people as an asianamerican whos double majoring in two asian languages one of them being mandarin and has taken some asian american studies classes this film was easier for me to understand but even without that kind of knowledge i believe this movie is still accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that its a comingofage type of movie the film is definitely worth seeing just so that you get the chance to see what kind of issues singapores young teenage boys are struggling and having to deal with this is an awesome comingofage movie but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way the actors are outstanding
