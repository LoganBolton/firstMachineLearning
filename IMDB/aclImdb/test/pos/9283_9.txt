yes nonsingaporeans cant see whats the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually get it but i plead with you foreigner look at the other crap thats been churned out from singapore and compare it to this film its like comparing a mules diarhhoea chunks to a little diamond this film is the first to truly show some the singapores seedy underbelly  something the forces that be pretend does not exist and theres a part in the film where a gangsterahbeng in our unique colloquial ingris curses in 4 languages namely tamil english malay and hokkien well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time the sad thing is that viewers from foreign contries will have an easier time getting their oily little claws on this gem in its country of origin it was banned initially only to be given and rrating and that too with about 20 cuts to it its nice to know you that one of the best creative edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain unadulterated uncensored halfway across the world than in your own nation
