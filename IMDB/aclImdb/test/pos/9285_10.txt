this program is certainly my favorite nonsitcom television comedy australia produces very little good programs  most of the tv which i watch and i live in australia is from the us and englandbr br the funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is like when they went past numerous security barriers at the apec summit pretending to be canadian diplomatsbr br the show is made up of prefilmed stunts general satirical discussion of current world events and sometimes onstage skits these all come together to make a fabulous extremely funny tv show the segments like ad roadtest and message from osama bin ladin are hilarious for anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical tv comedy  then this is definitely the show you should watchbr br all the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hourbr br i would rate it 1010
