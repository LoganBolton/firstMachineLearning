if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life i would definitely have to pick the chasers war on everything of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television i found chaser to be the funniest of all it is just so amazing the boys arent afraid to do anythingbr br whether its dress up as hitler to get into a polish club or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the tourism ads or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with 240 to buy some water the chaser boys will go therebr br in agreement with the comments above andor below the chasers war on everything is more popular than their previous program cnnnn but cnnnn was just as funny some unforgettable moments from that show clean up cambodia classicbr br so anyway to stop me from ranting further i strongly advise you to at least give chaser a chance youll more than likely find it hilarious
