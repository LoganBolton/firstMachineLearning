in the goofs section for this film theres a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where augustes car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene this is incorrect one of the views is from augustes flat the other is from valentinés flat across the street the whole purpose of this segment is to show how valentiné and auguste  who may be made for each other  almost cross paths as happens several other times but never quite do so until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film and here there is the implication that joseph has manipulated things so that auguste is on that ferry having inspected valentinés ticket to see which sailing she is booked on
