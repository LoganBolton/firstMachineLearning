when you think of brilliant australian comedy you dont think of skit shows although im quite partial to a bit of 80s and 90s full frontal or even sitcoms  you think of satire something that we australians really know how to do well eg front line the micallef program we know how to take the pi and the chasers war on everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well br br ive been a huge fan of chris taylor and craig reucassel for a long time i remember listening to them on triple js afternoon show they were and remain two of the funniest comedians aroundbr br although i was sad when they left triple j i was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave they were doing cnnnn and triple j at the same time so i figured this was something much bigger and what an amazingly hilarious show chaser is biting political and social satire at its bestbr br im also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time slot than friday nights and has been moved to wednesday nights right after spicks and specks thank you abc finally i dont have to tape it
