i find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the abomb and its development for decades after the manhattan project was completed my suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the movie and entertainment industries in the 1950s through the 1970s with mccarthyism and related national security phobias including the hollywood blacklist there was one film in the 1950s with robert taylor about col paul tibbits who flew the enola gay in the hiroshima bombing but otherwise nothing else one could glance at a side issue tragedy the sinking of the uss indianapolis soon after the delivery of the bombs to tinian in robert shaws description of the shark attacks on the survivors in jaws but the actual trials and tribulations of groves oppenheimer and their team was not considered filmablebr br and then in 1989 two films appeared i have reviewed one already day one which i feel is the better of the two in discussing the lengthy technical and emotional and political problems in the manhattan project the acting of brian dennehy as general groves and david strahairn as oppenheimer was first rate and neatly balanced small side vignettes concerning the antibomb crusade of szilard michael tucker help fill out the story wellbr br thats the problem here paul newman is a great actor as is mr dennehy but newman approached groves in a different way that while not dreadful is lesser than dennehys intelligent but soft spoken military brass newman seems too popped eyed about the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the afterschool yard with yes it certainly was but the real groves would have been more like dennehy keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future but on the business of creating that great toy br br dwight schultzs performance as oppeheimer helps maintain the films basically interesting and good production aided by bonnie bedelia as his wife but the most interesting aspect of this film is in the upgrading of the two tragedies of daghlian and slotin in particular the latter in the character of john cusacks merriman inevitably in all technological advances people are killed its just that these two tragedies on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in hiroshima and nagasaki brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a socalled peaceful controlled experiment the two tragedies particularly louis slotins slow agonizing death by radiation poisoning showed how much care was needed in using atomic power  and how the barest of chances could still cause disaster the only really different thing i saw in cusacks performance and the script and the actual incident with slotin was that slotin actually took some time after the accident to figure out where all his fellow research scientists were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident he was able to show that only he got the full effect of the accidental blast so that only relatively minor treatment would be needed by the others perhaps the full story of slotins actions was too technical for the screen but given the humongous pain he suffered in the end that he took time off to think of the others shows what a first rate person he really was
