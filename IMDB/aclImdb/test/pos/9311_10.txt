this was a very funny fast paced movie i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others id just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know how do hk producers choose their subtitle translators im most curious please direct me br br again to return to review it is a really rollicking film with plenty of content subtleties reminiscent of the classics though full of slapstick reminiscent say of the mexican comedies of cantinflasbr br the film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes trying to get to characteristics rarely explored the directors entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a disarming waybr br and i dont see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped
