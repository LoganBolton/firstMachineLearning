ive heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film and taking them off if you are expecting the damato genius displayed in films like buio omega or death smiles on murder you wont find it here nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombiemonster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death only from damato there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death the film is set on a beautiful tropical island as far as i know there is no subtitled version so if you dont speak italian you wont know what is going onbut who cares right in all honesty gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only will for sure be offended instantly i can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through damatos output and coming across this atrocity out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior but dont bother watching either if they are cut porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected even the monster looks no where as good as george eastmans character in anthropophagus the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your damato film quest
