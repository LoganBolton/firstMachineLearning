i enjoyed this film very much i found it to be very entertaining for me in that i feel that it captured the romanticism of turn of the century irishamerican culture theres no messages theres no violence and theres no overt sex just wholesome 1947 style entertainment and dennis morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs a really good movie
