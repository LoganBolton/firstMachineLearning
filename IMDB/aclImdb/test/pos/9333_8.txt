although i am not a michael jackson fan i like some of his early songs and some from jackson 5 too thriller is one of his great songs and it comes from the bestselling album ever with the same title as for the video it is awesome one of michaels best but also very eccentric and weirdbr br there is a story behind this video but its so complex that even i cant fully understand it its freaky the freakiest things are jacksons transformation into a werewolf his evil red eyes at the end like a werewolf and those dead people dancingbr br the video is very dark thrilling chilly and original there are great sceneries and settings the music itself is full of life and rhythm characteristic from the good old pop from the 80sbr br i like vincent prices soliloquy he does a great narration with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter at the end is awesome my favorite videos of the king of pop are billie jean and dont stop til you get enough both among his best songs
