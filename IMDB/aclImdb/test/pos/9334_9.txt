for those who remember this videos initial impact it will never be forgotten and a viewing of thriller is all thats needed to feel twelve years old again but while its a great video its not perfect even though it seemed like it at the time when this video first came out nobody had ever seen anything like it before now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds and a fresh viewing of thriller will reveal its faults why was it necessary to deconstruct the song when michael jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre he sings all the verses of the song skipping the choruses after he becomes a zombie when it comes time for him to sing again his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears and he sings the chorus again and again and again as if to make up for its previous absence this may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video but it certainly wasnt the last time it has continued to be a problem in the age of mtv the best videos like jacksons billie jean and beat it have used visuals to serve the music not the other way around still thriller is great fun and an absolute must on halloween
