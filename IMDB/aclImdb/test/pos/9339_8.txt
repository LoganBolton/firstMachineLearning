i dont particularly care from michael jackson aside from being a pedophile i really do not like his music with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album thriller this is one of them i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever madebr br this was directed by john landis best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london this music video is not so much a music video but more or less a short horror film mj and his date are at a werewolf movie when they leave the movie they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies when michael jackson does his famous thriller dancebr br you know this actually is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats this and beat it are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over i especially love vincent prices cameo as the narrator his distinctive voice is perfect for a horrorthemed music video even if you dont like mjs music you need to see this video at least once by the way he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose
