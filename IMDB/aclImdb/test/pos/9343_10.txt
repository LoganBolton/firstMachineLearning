john landis truly outdid himself when he directed michael jacksons thriller as a short film of course its corny the dialogue is terrible and it all seems way too cheesy but its perfect nonethelessbr br michael and his date are out at the cinema to view the latest horror flick when it all gets a little too graphic for the date she leaves michael follows on the way home they decide to take a shortcut through the local graveyard there it beginsbr br the actual thriller dance is amazing its full of those trademark jackson moves as well as some memorable zombie moves too it doesnt appear rushed at all nor too long the whole thing seems movielike and it really is actually rather scary of course its one of the most famous music videos of all time and is probably the greatest music video ever made as wellbr br overall watch it seriously those 13 minutes will be some of the best ever spent staring at a screen 55
