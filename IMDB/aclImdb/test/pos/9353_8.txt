my top 2 actors happen to be in this film  robert ryan and robert mitchum br br ryan could play anything from shakespeare to arthur miller and play it magnificently in this film when he starts his speech people with names like samuels and others with names that are hard to say  it is chilling to watch himbr br robert young plays the policeman who is called to investigate the murder of samuels sam levine a civilian who is chatting with several soldiers in a bar mitchell is the soldier wanted in connection with it  his wallet has been found in the apartment but mitchell is a gentle soldier who is only missing his wifebr br the story is told from different perspectives mitchell and samuels strike up a friendship and go back to samuels apartment samuels seems to know the loneliness that mitchell is feeling for years you have been concentrating on one peanut and now it is gone you dont know what to feel he says about the warbr br ryan is superb as monty the psychotic racistbr br robert young along with dick powell was an actor whose career was rejuvenated by filmnoir crossfire they wont believe me and the other woman are great examplesbr br robert mitchum is his usual laid back self as the philosopical keeleybr br gloria graham and paul kelly as the odd couple are outstanding as well in their brief but telling rolesbr br this is probably the best film about racism ever made
