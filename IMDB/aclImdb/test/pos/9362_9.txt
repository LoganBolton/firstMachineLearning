this was a very gritty movie about antisemitism however unlike gentlemens agreement that also deals with antisemitism the movie has aged well and doesnt seem heavyhanded in other words it deals with the topic without seeming preachy or trite by todays standardsbr br robert ryan plays one of the most vile characters as he beats a guy to death just because hes jewish robert mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crimebr br i give the movie kudos for its gritty and unflinching look at hate it is in many ways an example of film noireven though the topic isnt about the usual gangsters or robbery
