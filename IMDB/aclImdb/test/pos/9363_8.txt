rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award the acting script continuity et cetera are all just about perfect and the story is well worth the viewers 82 minutes although the picture softpetals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual  such disguises never work perhaps werent intended tobr br i could nitpick about a few details but just for fun there was no allnight movie house in washington dc in 1947  and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldnt talk through the show there werent any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde none if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news not the timeshearald evening star and certainly not the knownothing washington post but these little things take nothing away from this classicbr br the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score except during the credits ive only seen this done in a few filmsbr br on the negative side since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was ready for in 1947 blah blah blah as if this fool has any business judging his betters id say the exgis in 1947  the greatest generation  were much smarter and had better values  than some commentator film historian or other wisemouth in 1995 put a sock in it
