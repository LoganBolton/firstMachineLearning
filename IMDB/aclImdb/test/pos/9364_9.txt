crossfire is one of those films from the forties that is crying for a remake if for no other reason than maybe its time it should be done as originally written the story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man but antisemitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post world war ii with the holocaust fresh in everyones mindbr br in the lee server biography of robert mitchum edward dmytryk the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with the code firmly in place it could have been though because the character of robert ryan is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal normsbr br mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride robert young was cast as the washington dc police homicide captain who catches the case and while mitchum was second billed he knew from the beginning the film would belong to ryan but he was rkos new star by dint of his performances in the story of gi joe and till the end of time so he was there for box office insurance mitchums part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case george cooperbr br crossfire is not a whodunit even though we dont see the crime it becomes clear that montgomery is the one who kills sam levene the quintessential jewish salesperson and it becomes clear to young and mitchum that ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience it becomes just a question of getting the evidencebr br ryan earned one of several academy award nominations the film garnered his best supporting actor category though he lost to edmund gwenn the film was ryans breakthrough role similarly gloria grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for best supporting actress but she lost to celeste holm for gentlemans agreement in fact crossfire ran up against gentlemans agreement and lost for best picture and best director for dmytryk to elia kazan its fifth nomination for best screenplay and crossfire came up short again with the winner being miracle on 34th streetbr br gloria grahame also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life she was having big trouble with her then husband stanley clements who was an abusive husband he was hanging around the set causing ed dmytryk a lot of problems fortunately grahames part was a small one in fact the whole film was shot in typical rko economy style in 20 daysbr br robert young has a particularly fine scene with william phipps a young kid from tennessee in mitchum and ryans outfit who ryan constantly belittles young is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as irish catholics who came over in the potato famine years it was one of robert youngs best moments on screen in his long careerbr br as fine a film as crossfire is its time to be remade as a story about an antigay hate crime especially with the real killing of barry winchell from the last decade and the debate about gays in the militarybr br thats a film whos time has come and almost gone
