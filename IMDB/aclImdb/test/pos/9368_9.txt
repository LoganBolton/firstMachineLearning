a film like crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness ie the recent film crash almost to shame not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intoleranceisrotten more significantly although id wager crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with crash maybe its not really necessary to compare the two as crossfire is in its core all deep into the filmnoir vein like its going out of style it was interesting actually to see what the director edward dmytryk said on the dvd interview where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower on purpose so that more could be spent on the actors and the schedule went through at a very brisk quick pace but then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting setups that it took a lot to do just for a small scene like when robert mitchums keeely first goes in for questioning under the captain robert young the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite that there are many other lighting setups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell the bars silhouetted against them and see what i meanbr br but back to the substance part of the film its really a story that consists of a murder mystery but one that we as the audience dont take long to figure on the answer its then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldnt be found in a common crime picture then as there are really no criminals for the most part in the film theres a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the worthwhile message against antisemitism but dmytryks direction of his topshelf cast along with a really terrific script by john paxton fleshes out the characters least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message and what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it mitchum helps that along even in scenes like between him and young where its very much based in the situation of the storys moment ie a detail in the plot by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog it may already be there in the lines but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenesbr br then theres also robert ryan who excels at montgomery as a man who you know you dont like much at first just through his bs demeanor but youre not totally sure about either then once it starts to come clearer ironically through a subjective viewpoint of the suspect mitchell george cooper at the apartment of the soontobedeceased samuels his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blindway its a good performance when also countered with cooper who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility its really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this however and while youre watching the film its more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes and in the sometimes stark overpowering camera moves on the actors so the message is in a way secondary not that it isnt an important one especially for the time period coming right off of ww2 but years later its seeing the actors even the ones that dont get the big marquee status like gloria grahame as ginny the femme fatale of the picture if it couldve had time for one which it doesnt and william phipps as leroy the hick working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplaybr br dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too as for very long stretches we hear nothing and mostly when it does come up its incidental to the characters surroundings he couldve just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis most specifically the opening audiencegrabber into the film by sticking clear of that and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine memorable level my favorite scene would probably go to finleys story about an irish immigrant he tells to leroy where all such elements come into place well it might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs and id still throwdown murder my sweet as the directors masterpiece in this kind of picture but its assuredly higher in quality than something of the blevel too
