 spoilers throughout  this is a very strange film  particularly for its time  in every respect for six years american movies had shown american soldiers as everybodys son brother fatherbr br in movies like the best years of our lives and til the end of time our hearts are tugged by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families yet in this same year this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer  one message of this film is  lock up your daughters br br even the good soldiers  with plenty of time on their hands  are gambling all the time getting stupefyingly drunk and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more and their reaction to the police investigating a murder is  to conspire against thembr br mitchum the most sympathetic soldier says things like i dont know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the war havent seen her in two years do i care not really maybe well make a go of it maybe not br br another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away he would like to see his wife againbr br later when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a whores home  without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine indeed she is  i guess its hey soldiers will be soldiersbr br the police detective played by robert young who is trying to crack a murder case states convincingly and with infinite weariness about someones account of their actions on the night in question br br do i care no i dont really care about anything any more ive done this too long i guess br br a man shows up at the whores apartment he says im just a man like you interested in the whore then he says no thats a lie im her husband id like to be in the military i was turned down before tbr br hen he says no thats a lie why would i want to be a soldier he goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is to the end of the movie we havent a clue who he is or why he is therehes one of the strangest characters in the history of movies br br a man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend she leaves to change her dress  and is right back wearing another no problem yet the man doesnt leave with his girlfriend  who simply disappears  but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar the man then extrapolates from the minimal information hes learned about the soldier  to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers  and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick this is strange stuffbr br similarly a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out for a real dance  and dinner maybe yet she does dance with him  and immediately gives him the key to her home br br were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them br br robert ryan kills his host a stranger when hes enraged that the jewish host tries to get the steadily drunker ryan out of his home the reason for the murder no jew tells me how to drink how to drink huh what does that mean br br this movie is always offkilter quite deliberately so  the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie ive ever seenbr br and yet the movie is utterly gripping you simply have no idea how these people are going to act  or what new bizarre character is going to pop up  without anyone thinking the persons actions are strange in the least  eg the wifes behaviorbr br the acting is about the finest ie ever seen  from robert young robert ryan gloria grahame who earned an oscar nomination paul kelly and other actors id never heard ofbr br id never heard of this movie  and its a complete delight that ive discovered one that i shall want to see again and again and again its really strange but impossible to look away from because youve no idea what these creatures will do next
