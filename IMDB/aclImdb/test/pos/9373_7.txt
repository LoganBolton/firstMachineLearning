crossfire 1947br br great message great symbolism very good moviebr br its hard to go totally wrong with robert mitchum robert young and robert ryan all together as the three male leads and with director edward dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn thats reason enough to watch it once and even twicebr br you might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained too much or shown in flashback also too much because its a little complicated without good reason but it makes sense overall and we see early on too early probably who the culprit is and even whybr br besides the drama well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make postwar films dramatic there is the social message the antiantisemitic point of it all it only borders on preachy once or twice and its such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made approvingly and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row which they do especially young who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective and ryan who is mean in a believably crude and angry way ryan is good at that his typecasting reasonable mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for and the fourth known acting force gloria grahame is a great brief presence even if slightly dispensablebr br though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message both of which grow in force as we go it is really easy to watch just for the lighting camerawork and acting including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film all done with shadows br br the archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the antisemitism thread the shellshocked soldier rendered helpless but still intrinsically capable the modest youngster without confidence but capable too and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there and of course the angry violent soldier who is a product of the war too this last is also a responsibility of societyeven the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here not just because they are criminal but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful warbr br the audience then more than now could really get but its there to appreciate still
