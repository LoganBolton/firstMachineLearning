i havent read the source richard brooks novel the brick foxhole which i hope is not as infelicitous as its title but i understand the original villain was a homophobe not an anti semite and to be honest sam levene is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier but okay you have to go with the flow consider 1947 not even antisemitism has been treated on screen yet many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves jews but antisemitism had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant so we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual now thats really unpleasant  and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for robert ryan to get away with it we are by no means free of prejudice but weve still come a long way since 1947br br watching this again for the first time in years i was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie the many shots of two people talking the shadows the time that passes between the question and the answer the uninspired editing but i could live with that because of the films subject matter and because of a few other thingsbr br one of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is robert ryans performance the guy does a splendid job at times he can seem thoughtful cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police  any way i can help yes sir then alone or with another soldier the simmering hatred rises to the top not so much through what he says but the way he looks that scowl that penetrating stare those dark eyes glittering wowbr br the film has taken a lot of heat because of robert youngs preachy speech about his grandfathers murder that doesnt bother me at all although i guess dmytryk didnt have to have young shove his face into the camera while talking about micks and papists still taking the context into account its one of the more shocking moments of the film part of its impact is due to youngs almost casual delivery of the message and part of it is due to the messages not having been heard on screen beforebr br another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the paul kelly character and his relationship to the whore gloria grahame holy guacamole what elliptical conversation kelly is given to you know what i told you all those things i just told you theyre all lies his character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness its impossible to know what to make of him he adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presencebr br its a moody murky film its people live in the dark and there is murder afoot practically no one screams or shouts the horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems just beneath the surfacebr br see it if you have a chance
