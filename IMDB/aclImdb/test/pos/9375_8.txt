a bigoted soldier kills a man for being jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier not as good as the novel it was based on the brick foxhole in which it was a gay man who was killedbut hollywood wouldnt touch that in 1947 that said its still a very good film the antisemitism is handled very well but its hammered into the audience that bigotry is badwell duh but this was 1947 the picture is wellacted by the entire cast especially robert young and robert ryan and the tone is very darkas it should be very atmospheric too a deserved big hit in its daywell worth seeing
