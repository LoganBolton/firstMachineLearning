definitely a must see for all fans of film noirbr br thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thrillerbr br wonderful characterizations articulate the movies powerful message of racial and religious tolerance its difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isnt a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chillingbr br making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage nowall these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and deafening soundtracks its refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like crossfirebr br another low budget gem from the hollywood archives
