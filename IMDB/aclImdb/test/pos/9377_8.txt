as a rule there are few things more dispiriting than hollywoods attempts to be courageous mixing caution with heavyhandedness message movies pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems crossfire is not entirely free from this taint it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious assuming a level of naivity in its audience thats depressing to contemplate as late as 1947 it was a big deal for a movie to announce that antisemitism existed and that it was bad it was unthinkable of course for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was basedÂ—its victim was a homosexual nevertheless thanks to good writing and excellent acting crossfire remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crimebr br postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir and crossfire addresses it directly the film is set in washington dc among soldiers still in uniform but idle spending their days playing poker and barcrawling joseph samuels sam levene an intelligent and kindly jew explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up samuels meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive mitchell who is close to a nervous breakdown the weakwilled floyd bowers and montgomery a tall overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from tennessee as a stupid hillbilly the three soldiers wind up at samuels apartment where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive calling his host jewboy samuels is beaten to death and mitchell disappears making himself the prime suspect for the killingbr br unraveling the crime are detective finlay robert young dry and bythebook and sergeant keeley robert mitchum a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder among the pieces of the puzzle are ginny gloria grahame a nightclub hostess who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key and floyd steve brodie who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house while there is no real whodunit suspense the story remains gripping and the trap laid for the killer is extremely cleverbr br the strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious the cinematography is a striking shadowplay with inky darks and harsh lights rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke worldweariness is as pervasive as noir lighting nothing interests me finlay says quietly to nothing is ginnys toast in the nightclub gloria grahame the paragon of noir femininity nearly steals the movie with her two scenes platinumblonde jaded and caustic shes the quintessential bgirl poisoned by the stinking gin mill where she works for laughs she says bitterly her sweet face curdling when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted courtyard then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment when he goes there he meets a weasely crumplefaced man paul kelly who seems to sponge off ginny and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions gloria blows mitchells goodgirl wife off the screen in a scene where shes asked to give mitchell an alibi slim and frail in her bathrobe with her girlish lisp she lets us see just how often ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a trampbr br robert young is a nondescript actor and he stands no chance against mitchums charisma but he does a good job of keeping his pipesmoking character saddled with delivering the movies earnest message this side of pompousness mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when hes doing nothing but lounging in a corner you cant take your eyes off him the third robert ryan creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable bigot we see his phony geniality his bullying his resentment of anyone with advantages his am i right or am i right smugness how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising thembr br crossfires message seems cautious and dated now though not nearly so much as the same years a gentlemans agreement finlays speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood reminding us that irish catholics were once persecuted next it could be people from tennessee he says or men who wear striped neckties or maybe blacks or japanese or homosexuals or communists the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems it sweetens its message by making the jewish victim saintly as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to exonerate the military having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like montgomery and stressing that samuels served honorably in the war still it did take some guts to depict immediately after world war ii an american who might have been happier in the nazi army and the movies basic premise is still valid if monty were alive today he would have gone out on september 12 2001 and beat up a sikh
