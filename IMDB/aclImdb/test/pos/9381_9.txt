george barrys death bed the bed that eats is at root a dark fairy tale told via a horrormovie framework it is in my opinion one of the best films of the 1970s and its downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without barrys knowledge those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed asap if youre looking for overt gore or rabid action death bed the bed that eats isnt the flick for you death bed is a gentler weirder drivein picture it plays like an utterly strange dream halfremembered id recommend reading stephen throwers summation of death bed in throwers fab press book nightmare usa he describes the movies vibe perfectly whether intentional or not ive noticed shades of death bed in everything from the phantasm films to michele soavis cemetery man to the magicrealismslipstream fiction of authors such as kelly link barry is an original and in a fair world im sure he wouldve followed death bed with a number of fantastically bizarre films
