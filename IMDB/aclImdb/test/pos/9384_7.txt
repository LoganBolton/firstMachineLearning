a large bed possessed by a demon eats people among other things im not making this upbr br completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to dvd in 2003 death bed the bed that eats is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe you most likely know of it thanks to patton oswalts excellent bit about it as well as stephen throwers essential book nightmare usa while watching it you wonder the followingbr br who is george berry and what drugs did he smokeinjectsnort before writing and directing this moviebr br is this a horror comedy a combination of a horror flick and an art movie a weird prank being pulled on the audiencebr br what the hell am i watchingbr br death bed really defies any explanation i know that term is overused but it couldnt be truer than it is here this truly beggars description it is a horror comedy as well as art filmhorror hybrid but the whole thing is so surreal it must be seen the score sounds like the electronic bits from an old candlemass album the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything the direction is surprisingly competent and the movie at times feels like a jesus franco moviethat is if his movies were intentionally funnybr br in the end there really is no proper way to describe this movie lord knows ive tried but really few movies are as odd unique or mind boggling as this is see itbut youve been warned this is also the only movie george berry has ever done he definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this ill tell you that much
