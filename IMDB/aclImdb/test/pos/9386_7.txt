as roger corman has said in an interview lowbudget filmmaking enables filmmakers to take chances on offbeat ideas well youd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barrys death bed the bed that eatsbr br the film does have a back story to it and its an interesting one at that ill forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acidbr br death bed is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously its a truly strange and unconventional horror flick it dabbles in exploitative ingredients  theres some tasty dollops of female nudity  and yet is also art albeit art with a completely skewed sensibilitybr br the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie quality the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although patrick spencethomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist  narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand future boy meets world father william russbr br this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film  even if the exposure took years to take holdbr br if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items death bed may be just what youve got in mindbr br 710
