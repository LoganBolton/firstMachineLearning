death bed the bed that eatsbr br judging from the title you can guess what this movie is about and yet there is a lot more background story to this film then one might suspectbr br okay so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food but there are also a few subplots i wont spoil them for you but theyre a nice touchbr br sadly the acting in this movie is very mediocre the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesnt really help to improve the quality of the movie as a wholebr br because there is a lot of voiceover work the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers sometimes it works sometimes it doesntbr br the effects are fine sure it could be a lot better if you compare it with todays movies but you really shouldnt just judge the movie as it is and dont take it too seriously you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative if you are easily spooked dont watch this movie you might never want to sleep againbr br death bed the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget but id still recommend it to fans of horror moviesbr br in conclusion i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for its creative story and unexpected twists here and there
