hmmmm im kinda at a loss here i mean i know i liked death bed i know ill be spreading the gospel of death bed to all my friends and acquaintances and if youre reading this i urge you to see death bed but i cant really say why perhaps thats the secret of its charmbr br plot well sort of theres this bed that eats people and fried chicken apples flowers suitcases and any other darn thing that gets near it by sucking them inside its digestivefluid filled mattress amongst its nearlimitless powers bed has the ability to keep the spirit of aubrey beardsley trapped behind a picture to observe and narrate the events of the film various people then wind up at beds abandoned mansion beds habit of eating anything that moves gave the place an unsavory reputation and lay down to have sex or take a nap or because they dont feel well and get eaten sometimes having trippy dreams first and in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between beardsley beds mom you had to be there and bedbr br seems rather straightforward when i put it like that doesnt it  well except for the aubrey beardsley part but something feels constantly offkilter and the story seems to glide sleepily from one scene to the next even when indulging in cheap laughs or strange gore effects imagine bunel crossed with bergman then left to soak in a big vat of herschell gordon lewis the tone of the story shifts from horror to fairy tale to comedy to existential meditation without breaking stride  an incredible achievement for a nobudget student film shot in the detroit areabr br all in all an astounding little film that quite probably no review can ever completely do justice see it for yourself
