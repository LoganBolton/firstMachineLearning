its really rather simple the name of the movie is death bed the bed that eats if you are anything like me you already know if you are going to like this movie i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title and the box alonebr br im a huge fan of b movies this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies ive ever seen now its not for every onebr br granted its not even for most people as a matter of fact i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this moviebr br for those of you who like b movies though this film is a diamond in the rough it has a great premise a bed that eats people it doesnt walk it doesnt move it doesnt have a siren call to attract people it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on itbr br i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks ive owned itbr br like i said after reading the title of the film you already know if youll like it if you laughed or smiled then give it a go its worth it
