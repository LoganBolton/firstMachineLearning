this film is on my top 20 comedies list this is a truly unique film to the reviewer who said i must be really missing somethingyou are correct you are missing something if you dont have the kind of sense of humor this film requires thats one thing but dont give it a bad review because you think its looney but isnt intended to be loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being i laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than i do at most other funny filmsbr br michael almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an independent spirit award for best first feature crispin glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now harry dean stanton puts in an excellent comic performance william burroughs is incredible in a small role dylan mcdermott was ideally cast and lois chiles is completely excellentbr br all of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of crispins finest performancesup there with his performances in rivers edge and willard if you are a crispin glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is youre doing and see this immediatelybr br but just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something this is a great film but it is very unusual and i recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing
