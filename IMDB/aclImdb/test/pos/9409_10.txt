id heard of the case but hadnt really paid attention during the whole hoopla of fuhrman writing the book skakel being arrested etc however this movie did an excellent job of detailing martha the skakel brothers the murder mark fuhrmans involvement and the results of his investigation i especially liked the flashback scenes with martha talking about her last summer the actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real martha was probably like that it made martha seem like a real person rather than a victim id definitely recommend watching this
