i saw this film purely by chance it was shown very late or more correctly very early one morning on television i had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came onbr br it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere it certainly isnt as good as educating rita despite a couple of additional twists and has a very predictable endingbr br despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a wholebr br i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen him in many different films including dead calm the piano sirens children of the revolution event horizon bicentennial man and the ubiquitous jurassic park he was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shutbr br some of the acting was in my opinion dreadful rose byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for examplebr br however two actors who i hadnt or dont remember seen before impressed me a lot sinéad cusackn as frances frank kennedy and especially matthew newton as her son david he in particular was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him
