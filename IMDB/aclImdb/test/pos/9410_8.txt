having seen this without knowing all the hoopla surrounding the lead character indeed without even knowing that it was based on reallife events i must say i am impressed murder in greenwich is an above average production for a madefortv movie  the acting is uniformly great christopher meloni in particular putting in a standout performance and the teen actors excel in what are difficult roles the idea of the dead girl narrating the movie is a stroke of genius which elevates the movie from merely good to excellent the script is exemplary for what is essentially movieoftheweek fodder and the cinematography is beautiful
