yes it is a bit cheesy but its suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorites there are some excellent actors in the film and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters its interesting to see david soul in a bad guy role i thought he was quite believableand rather chillingas the evermoreparanoid co robert conrad is a longtime favoritei think he brings his character to life very well and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his ive watchedmovies or tv br br i watch this movie every so often but our tape a vhs tv copy i got is such poor quality its difficult to fully enjoy it this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd maybe it wouldnt be universally sought after but im sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version ill keep hoping
