maverick director seijun suzuki finally was able to film his dream project princess raccoon and in a way its lucky he didnt try this in the 1960s special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would havebr br some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film much as familiarity with shakespeares the tempest would help with peter greenaways dense prosperos books these two films actually have a bit in common although princess raccoon is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate itbr br while the art design acting and direction are fine for most of the film it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experiencebr br this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance its not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars
