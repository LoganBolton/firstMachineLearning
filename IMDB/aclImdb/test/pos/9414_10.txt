i use princess raccoon to give the film its notquite accurate english title as a litmus test for my friends sense of humour it either leaves them cold and baffled  as it clearly did several other commentators on this site  or results in doubledup laughter unassailably huge grins and occasional gasps of admirationbr br the laughter comes from the films consummate mixture of parodies in contemporary style targets include a bouquet of japanese and western classical stage drama forms from kabuki to late shakespearian and spanish renaissance christian fantasy the naff vacuity of the modern american and european musical as witness a host of random tap and rap dance songs and some very funny banal lyrics all choreographed with loving amateur cliché japanese anime and samurai liveaction clichés portentous buddhist ritual and the overweening sweetness of viennese operetta ive not laughed out loud so much at this type of film since ken russells outrageous musical deconstruction in the boyfriendbr br the grins come from the clever textual subversion of the japanese legend told in a traditional 5act structure reminiscent of the plays of the 17th century master chikamatsu as in his work the narrative is advanced in a mixture of song recitative highflown poetry and low comedy relief  here the potbroiling of the incompetent ninja ostrich by peasants under the illusion that he is a tanukiraccoon in human guise all of this somehow does hang together and even more remarkably does manage to engage the watchers emotions through the welter of cultural referencesbr br in truth princess raccoon wears its pancultural garb with alluring lightness and thats where the gasps of astonishment come in visually  again as with russells masterpiece  the film is a treat a riot of colour with its digitised backdrops of classical japanese images from screens and prints overthetop costumes and stage sets mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and seashores youll love it or loathe it but theres no point castigating chalk for being cheese and princess raccoon stands first and foremost as a wickedly funny as well as affectionate putdown of our contemporary cultural vacuity in both east and west bravo
