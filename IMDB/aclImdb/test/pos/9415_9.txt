one hilarious thing ill say off the top is im not the biggest seisun suzuki fan ive actually seen a fair number of his works thanks to a retrospective the film festival had and i found his films just a wee too yakuzadriven for my tastes so i went into princess raccoon wary of what i was going to see boy was i knocked out raccoon is suzukis attempt at a musical using the elements of japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements both audial and visual raccoon is a treat from start to finish the lead actor joe ogdari proves that hes one of the hottest actors in japan these days in this role i have to admire that the younger japanese actors still take roles that take place in feudaltimes japan dressing up in samurai gear to full effect the story itself does get a bit confusing if you dont follow it really closely but even if you dont prepare yourself for the treasures that princess raccoon has
