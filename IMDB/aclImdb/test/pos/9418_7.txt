i watched two very different holmes adventures this morning but you would be amazed at the similaritiesbr br the was presumably the first collaboration between basil rathbone if i were king romeo and juliet and nigel bruce and director roy william neill it was not their first sherlock holmes adventure as they did one a couple of years before thisbr br the made an excellent team but i prefer the hammer version which i will talk about laterbr br holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his work and i am constantly amused by the mannerisms displayed when they figure something out they always seem to dash on when they find a new cluebr br the story itself about keeping a bomb site from the germans in wwii was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery
