a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent director mark lamprell dealt with the potentially sobinducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival australian film veteran sam neill was as always fabulous in the role of franks uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying  you know bert newton matts dad get out and see this movie
