i liked this probably slightly more than terror by night though not enough to give it the extra  the beginning is just brilliant as we peek in on nazi agents scheming to get their hands on a new bomb sight and its inventor in a small swiss village only to be foiled by a disguised holmes who spirits the scientist back to london once there he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind it all  not hitler but worse holmes archenemy moriarty of course the scientist disappears leaving a tantalizing coded note and holmes goes in pursuit once again in disguise a climax in moriartys dockside lair is suitably exciting and we can all guess that all ends well cant we slightly overthetop patriotic message as the credits roll now that i think of it the fine sense of place despite the obvious sets rathbones use of disguise and the way in which so much plot is crammed into just over an hour  what the heck it gets that extra  and is my favorite of the 5 rathbonebruce films ive seen to datebr br watched on dvd part of the 50 mystery classics set from mill creek entertainment many of the transfers on these el cheapo box sets are of very poor quality but holmes fans take note that the rathbonebruce films there are 4 on this set are all quite watchable and reasonably sharp
