not too bad entry in the series heavily ladled with war propaganda but rathbone  bruces sincerity keep me happybr br its a rather fantastic story from start to finish just how many mcguffins are there holmes and moriarty independently reeling out the dancing men code uncoded so fast was amazing watson  so why werent you amazed the post explaining the bombsightenlarger tickled me it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play  once again reminding me that they didnt expect people to be critically watching this over 60 years later this and i think every other potboiler from universal at this period were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten they perhaps should have realised that basically people dont change that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now 2005 and tightened up on the script and setsbr br lionel atwill was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time i wonder if it was that or particularly effective makeup that made him look so haggard as moriartybr br the important thing about sw though is that this was the first holmes film roy william neill directed i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one thus establishing a marvellous ambient continuity
