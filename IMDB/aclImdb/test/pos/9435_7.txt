sherlock holmes basil rathbone and dr watson nigel bruce have been hired by the british government to protect a swiss scientist dr franz tobel william post jr he has a bomb that the british want to win the war unfortunately the evil dr moriarty lionel atwill is working with the nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctorand his inventionbr br moving sherlock holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reasonbasil rathbone arguably he is the best sherlock holmes ever put on the screen he plays the character so well and accurately that it doesnt matter what era hes solving crimes as for nigel bruce as watsoneverybody has problems with it he plays watson as a bumbling old foolthat is not the watson of the books you seriously wonder why holmes puts up with him still he does grow on you in a way then theres atwill having a whale of a time playing moriartythe discussions and battle of wits between him and holmes are just great ive never liked dennis hoey as inspector lestradehes such an idiot makes watson look like a genius and post jr is pretty good as tobel even though his accent amusingly keeps changingbr br this movie is done elaborately and runs only a little over an hour still it does have its slow spots and i never understood the secret code sectionbr br still worth catching if just for rathbone and atwill
