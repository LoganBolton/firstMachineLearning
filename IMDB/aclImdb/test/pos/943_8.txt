i cant see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 57 from imdb voters its a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other catastrophes the sugar factory occasional coarse language russian doll sample people the secret life of us la spagnola strange planet fresh air dust off the wings doing time for patsy cline etc as a 19yearold uni student newton in perhaps his best role yet on par with changi at least with a bored overreligious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him  and before you go thinking another goofy movie its not theres some real substance here sure its a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbojumbo arent they and maybe the study of sinead cusacks character is a little muddled at times but the film is bright funny and has some important messages the principle cast is terrific cusack and newton are wonderful and rose byrne see her also in the goddess of 1967 is so underrated its not funny shes a beautiful fresh confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives i gave my mother frank 810
