this is a classic american movie in combination with comedy romance  dream you may say there have been lots of these kind of films already but just believe me youll find this a good one because its well directed scripted and played amanda byness just crazily amazing shes humor cute  charming both inside  outside the screen shes the man indeed the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale what i mean byfairy tale is not the one with prince  princess but indicates faith namely it tells us to hold your faith dream  things that make you regret for your whole life if you dont do that one of those movies you cant miss out in your life
