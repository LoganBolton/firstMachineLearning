when i saw the first preview for this i nearly passed out from excitement i have long been a fan of twelfth night it turned me on to shakespeare so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true my anticipation was not disappointedbr br the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means complicated i dont want to even try to relate it the plot summery will probably cover the basics just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create i will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot reality is not the point of the filmbr br what it is though is absolutely hilarious nearly every scene nails the comedic setup kudos to the writers director and actors on that countbr br amanda bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully shes supercute not a vixen and can do faultless comedy i admire her so much for not going fullon tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do im glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood ok im off my soapboxbr br channing tatum yeah hes hot and built like a flippin gorilla but he really makes me laugh my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when hes trying to converse with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimenbr br the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane d√©butante mother and monique the classic evil girlfriendbr br overall lots of fun loooots of laughs and a highly attractive cast maybe not on par with the original but it beats out modern versions of other plays including the muchtouted 10 things i hate about you
