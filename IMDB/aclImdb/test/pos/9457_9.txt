i have been a fan of amandas since all that and she is still funny too me its as simple as that if you like the bynes you will like this film its harmless fun and quite funny in parts vis wacky sebastian accent and mannerisms are entirely unrealistic but made me laugh so hard at some points i almost choked on my popcorn br br and anything that gets teens reading shakespeare maybe is a good thing for me br br on a shallow note tatum channing is quite ahem freaking hot he also does a good job with some of the films tougher scenes br br some of the side characters are very broad but they are broad in twelfth night so its cool
