at first i honestly thought it would be a corny movie but after seeing this i was quite surprised amanda bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast especially that character played by bullet tooth tony from snatch what a contrasting role between those two movies now im not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not but her act especially was thoroughly enjoyable even though the plot devolved into a teenybopper love triangle though very funny halfway into the movie i feel that this shouldnt discount what i think the movie really is simply entertaining so if you happen to stumble upon it whether by dvd or theater im confident that youll enjoy
