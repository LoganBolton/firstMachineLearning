i have to be honest i really had a good time watching shes the man despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie it had some pretty decent laughs that i think anyone could get adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this moviebr br amanda bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy and when she is turned down to try out for the boys soccer team she decides to take over her brothers appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boys soccer team of course love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks shes her brother she also has a girl who is chasing after her well the tag line says it allbr br this is a fun little teen drama that i think will be remembered for a while amanda bynes did prove something in the film its really hard to really act like a guy d well its true br br 810
