shes the man was everything i wanted it to be and maybe even a little more i love the teen type chick flick films and i knew this one would be great in the same vein as 10 things i hate about you one of my all time faves shes the man is a unique well written very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy i have seen in a long time its probably the funniest movie ive seen this year with the exception of the hilarious pink panther but shes the man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script threes company style story of mistaken identities and mixed messages and the castbr br amanda bynes is a star even since the days of the horribly campy yet strangely entertaining the amanda show she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy shes probably one of the most talented comediennes out there her style of physical comedy impersonations and witty dialect makes her hilarious previously her big screen debut where she was the star was the rather hilarious and well made what a girl wants if that wasnt her break out vehicle than shes the man takes care of that hands down bynes is really the ultimate girl next door its a shame she doesnt do more big screen work because she could be the next it girl she is the all american cute down to earth bubbly teen although shes twenty now and whether or not shell be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen but for the purpose of this film she is perfect she actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable not entirelybut believable enough most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but its just hilarious non stop laughs channing tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005s havoc by plays duke hes the jock the captain of the soccer team and eventually bynes object of affection unfortunately hes also sebastians room mate who is bynes hes a good leading man and the chemistry is perfect between them laura ramsey is olivia who happens to be attracted to sebastian who again is bynes she does good as well although her part is small and she doesnt really effect the rest of the cast one way or another james kirk is great in his small role as the real sebastian his resemblance to amanda bynes is astonishingthey are absolutely believable as twins and further more from a distance you could understand someone believing bynes is sebastian the rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between bynes and tatum but everyone is more or less supporting bynes terrific performance she easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth whilebr br this is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet its not one of those films that when that part comes up its not funny anymore the parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film relative newcomer director andy fickman does such an incredible job on this film he weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together the story which is loosely based off of shakespeares twelfth night but its remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film its seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than youd think there isnt too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesnt change the hilarity of the first half of the film nonetheless youll be laughing to tears and its one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down 910
