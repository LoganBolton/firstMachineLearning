i got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in brea and i have been crazy for it ever since the film is based on shakespeares twelfth night which i have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so i certainly liked the references but whether you like shakespeare or not it wont matter  the movie stands on its on it is super funny witty and charming amanda bynes is hilarious and so was david cross actually the whole cast is great  i just happen to be a huge david cross fanatic the cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few i hadnt heard before but i know they have a cd coming out so i will definitely buy it everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish  all age groups
