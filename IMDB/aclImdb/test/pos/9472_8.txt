i saw this movie today opened yesterday here and was simply delightedbr br i saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie but then found it was based on shakespeares twelfth night  and then started trying to justify liking this flick on shakespearean grounds i really think this is going way overboard the only connections i could see with twelfth night are a the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man b the extensive malefemale humor arising out of that basic conceit and c some of the names including viola  dukebr br aside from those names the thematic commonalties a  b are really great themes for any script and this movies script is no exception beyond that though this really is a simply delightful and very contemporarytraditional teen flick and thats a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it  like alluding to shakespearebr br the movie is bright fastpaced emotive stylized funny  full of teen hormones and teen humor and malefemale humor suitable for all ages and thats really the best part imho really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing overthetop fun those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately with such a complexity of invention that im still a little bewildered  but really dont feel at all disappointed in that regard its not that kind of a movie things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next splitsecond happeningbr br amanda bynes really is just delightful as viola  sebastian channing tatum makes a wonderful duke david cross does a wonderfully over the top principal gold all of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target cinematography was excellentbr br wonderful entertainment from beginning to end  check it out
