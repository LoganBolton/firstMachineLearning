i just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and i cant remember a movie where i laughed so hard  literal out loud deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesnt matter that you know how its going to end the actors comedic senses of timing were impeccable the actors were perfectly cast my children mentioned that amanda bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who arent ruining their lives she is so refreshing my children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006 our money was well spent on this movie
