five years after she teamed up with james cagney in the public enemy mae clarke makes another appearance this time as his fianc√©e with cagneys character on the other side of the law it seems like she was calling more of the shots in their relationship as well trying to get johnny cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career you had to figure theyd get back together after she gave him the boot for challenging her crooked boss those things have a way of working out in picturesbr br i got a kick out of watching cagney in this one i usually do and here he looked like he might have auditioned that characteristic shoulder shrug move that he used to good effect in angels with dirty faces portraying rocky sullivan it was right after he threw cavanaugh robert gleckler out of his office during the first attempt at bribing the new weights and measures boss he turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook  very coolbr br its my understanding that this wasnt one of cagneys warner films but it might as well have been warners often took up the cause for the common man and the expose of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been right up their alley you also have those great new york city street scenes depicting cars and shops of the era with home made signs pricing flour at eighteen cents a pound hey how about the furniture store selling the living room set for a hundred eighty nine dollars you might get a single stick chair for that price todaybr br best part of the picture just might be that meat counter scene when cagney james burke aloysius and the butchers play catch with an underweight chicken one of the films lighter moments but you get an idea how tense people can get when theyre caught cheating same with the truck driver whos pressured by johnny into signing for an accurate delivery he just wasnt used to doing thatbr br all in all a nice diversion from cagneys more typical gangster presence even if not up to the standard of his feature films its easy enough to obtain as one of a handful of public domain cagney pictures out there and often found in relatively inexpensive compilations
