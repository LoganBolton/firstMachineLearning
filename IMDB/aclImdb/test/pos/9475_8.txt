this is the first james cagney film i have ever really watched i was never interested in his movies before because i figured i wouldnt like anything in that style of cinema and because ive heard most cagney films are the same i have to say i really liked it by todays standards for movies it was not special but i found it surprisingly entertaining cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well
