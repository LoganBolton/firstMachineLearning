this is what james cagney is all about wisecracks cockiness hard as nails and nononsense charismabr br although the plot sounds serious the film is anything but it is done in the 30s screwball comedy style and works well with his bickering with fianc√© mae clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague james burkebr br what raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it dialogue is good but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can bounce about the characters involved this is done well by all throughoutbr br good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable
