this two disc set is incredible if youre like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live then this is the next best thing jimmy page who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth second only to slowfingers himself he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film john paul jones although not as up front as page puts on one hell of a show although in the live atmosphere his rythmic bass lines arent as defined as they are on studio recordings except of course in songs like dazed and confused or what is and what should never be but his wide array of instumental talent is well displayed in these dvds john bonham is john bonham what can i say there is no comparison his beats stand out like no other and this dvd is proof last but not least robert plant wails like no other can wail if youve ever read hammer of the gods youll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant why the hell isnt this guy already famous and so concludes my review sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes zeppelin rocks
