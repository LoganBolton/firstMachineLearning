the only footage of zeppelin ive seen prior to this dvd is the song remains the same movie from 1976 we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequencesbr br so what of this dvd i didnt know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cdwhen did this come out i thoughtbr br for some reason i thought that page wasnt a great live guitarist but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement br br theres white summer from 1970  10 minutes of guitar wizardrybr br theres an acoustic set from 1975  bronyaur stomp has a brilliant fingerpicking improv sectionbr br the in my time of dying and trampled underfoot performances also from 75 are breathtaking  with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has demonic possessions of rawkbr br the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section the rendition of achillies last stand considering their various drugaddled states just beggars belief a song of complex guitar overdubs page arranged it in a way that lets him just punk it out live  the effect is totally mesmerising in the evening  i never liked this on disc but it zings along here sick again  great piece of sleazerock the footage from knebworth is very interesting cutting between big screen various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effectbr br plant is amazing throughout all the performances page despite being painfully thin looks like a sixyear old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert  and makes infectious viewingbr br one thing that puzzled me  the black dog performance from 1973 sounds very camped up robert plant always did love a little mince and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous  and would warrant an arrest nowadays all very different from the musclebound kicka studio versionbr br i love this dvd it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain
