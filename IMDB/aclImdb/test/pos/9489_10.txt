zeppelin is my favorite band so when i heard that this double dvd was coming out i was understandably excited ill just cut to the chase here and say that if you are any kind of zeppelin fan you must run out and buy this right away its absolutely spectacular it blows the song remains the same completely out of the water why this material was never released before is beyond me the footage presented here really shows zep at the peak of their game which i never really felt that song quite did jimmy page is the best ever without a doubt and these performances make jimi hendrix look like a chump be on the lookout for the live jam white summer whewbr br viva jimmy pagebr br viva led zeppelinbr br 11 out of 10
