some people dont like led zeppelin but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who dont is way unbalanced i am the proud converter of 2 or 3 led zeppelin fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvdbr br for one how someone can listen to stairway to heaven or immigrant song without falling in love with zeppelin is beyond me but to play the guitar and not like page that is like being christian and not liking jesus my friend was like led zeppelin sucks and i was like oh yeah watch this after about 2 mins of watching page pick through white summerblack mountain side he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about zeppelin sincebr br incase you havent been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led zeppelin held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathensbr br course there are some things missing like over the hills and far away a good version of immigrant song and i really didnt need 2 version of whole lotta love but what the hell ill take embr br because there is nothing besides the song remains the same to compare this too i gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a 10
