i just rewatched a few episodes of this series on very poor vhs tapes that i recorded the series on im glad i did thoughbr br ramona is based on the childrens books by beverly cleary and follows the adventures of the title eightyearold sarah polley she has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eightyearolds all ten episodes are pretty good mystery meal kind of grosses me out as a vegan but its funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cows tongue and any episode that mentions godzilla versus the smog monster twice cant be all bad i like ramonas bad day even more although its disheartening to see ramona going through a rough day she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend howies uncle a prepsi factor barclay hope who always teases her the perfect day is also goodbr br lori chodos plays beezus ramonas sister i swear ive seen her on something else but imdb doesnt list anything besides this show unfortunately this series is not on dvd why is every crappy show made these days on dvd except something id actually like to buy an injustice if there ever was one
