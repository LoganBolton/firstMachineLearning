this is apparently the first film featuring gloria swansonthe film that made her a breakout star while she was good in the film i cant see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the timebut still it was a very good filmbr br gloria plays the wife of a rich slob that continually takes her for granted he cares little for his grooming eats onions and forgets their anniversary and at the same time a lothario comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to gloria and her dippy husband doesnt even notice or give her any reason not to cheat on him ultimately she divorces her hubby and marries the smoothtalking romeo however while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama they were pretty common at the time it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film while not the greatest silent film i have seen it is a standout and deserves to be rememberedbr br by the way the dvd release from image entertainment is surprisingly goodwith a decent print and music this hasnt always been true of other image releases particularly how sloppily they handled the chaplin releases
