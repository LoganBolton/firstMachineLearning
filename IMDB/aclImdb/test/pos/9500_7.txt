dont change your husband is on the one hand the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from cecil b demille on the other it is his first picture to star gloria swanson probably the greatest actress of the silent era and is the film which made her a starbr br although the old demille formula was beginning to change and his films were becoming wordier and less purely visual with such an expressive performer as swanson we regain much of that silent storytelling style her character does very little but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression  with a particular talent for looks of disdain in real life swanson was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to wallace beery and its possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performancebr br as if to best complement his leading ladys talents demilles use of framing and closeups is particularly strong here he uses cinematic technique to show off the acting  often holding swanson in lengthy closeups at key moments  and also to clarify the story visually for example when we are introduced to the character of toodles she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror her character disappears from the story only to become important towards the end that attentiongrabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was later at the anniversary dinner swanson and future husband number two lew cody are framed together in one shot while elliot dexter is isolated in his own frame also  and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general  there is much use of reaction shots  for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dollsbr br in contrast to demilles visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator jeanie macpherson as ive remarked in several other comments macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story but like demille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style and so we get these very long quasiphilosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which if they improve the story at all it is only because they are unintentionally funny for example only jeanie macpherson could come up with a line like fate sometimes lurks in christmas shopping fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them upbr br although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale it is at this point that demille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular you can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of swanson being showered with pleasure wealth and love it wouldnt be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectaclebr br all in all dont change your husband is a fairly decent demille silent picture although to be honest it is only really the presence gloria swanson that lifts it above the average its curious though that this is supposedly a comedy and swanson was cast at least in part because of her background at mack sennetts slapstick factory she hated comedy acting and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance it makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with demille male and female was by far the strongest of their collaborations
