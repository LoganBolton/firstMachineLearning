no more corned beef and cabbage for herbr br this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists some imaginary scenes and a costume party all of this is centered around the wife of the husbands who is looking to break out of the doldrums played by gloria swanson she is twenty here both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods from frivolous to worried to hopeful br br behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love theres a little corniness but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all as with many films from this period the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying or thinking but often give a kind of philosophical insight as if to justify the tragedy or raciness and there is that higher purpose here probably better without the instructional text but its part of the narrative style and its kind of quaint br br if you are looking for visual or formal amazement you wont find it here but as a story well acted and filmed with precision and economy its really a great example the events might not come as a total surprise but its such a modern love story set almost a hundred years ago its a gas and did i saw swanson was perfect
