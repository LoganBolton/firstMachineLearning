the residents are a band known for their strange appearances and odd musical stylings so obviously their music videos arent going to be exactly normal in fact these little videos are abnormal and bizarre but have a huge artistic value to them the atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals its a great watching experiencebr br basically icky flix just consists of many residents music videos made for their songs the music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like its straight out of an 80s horror film what doesnt change is the quality of these videos theyre greatbr br any fan of art films will love these theyre so original with their visuals and the angles they are filmed at and the lighting especially make these so interesting the music is creepy and catchy and highly original and these short films are miniclassics that deserve multiple watchings this is a nearperfect collection of short videosbr br my rating  out of  56 mins
