this review contains mild spoilers but not enough to spoil the storybr br watched nihon chinbotsu sinking of japan or japan sinks depending on where you live recently a remake of the 1970s movie of the same name which itself was based on sakyo komatsus bestselling novel this movie is a gem of japanese filmmaking it appears that japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west the americans predict that it would happen in the period of 40 years but according to drtadokoro a seemingly mad scientist it will happen in less than a year the japanese government isnt that convinced but sets up a disaster evacuation plan as well as form a new d1 team to handle the crisis while on a trip to china to negotiate evacuation plans the japanese prime minister was killed and sends the cabinet into a state of panic the d1 team is left to handle most matters and led by the newly elected minister of crisis management saoro takamori drtadokoros exwife she turns instead to drtadokoro for advice and he has plans to blow astronomically huge holes under japan to avert the process of sinkingbr br japan would soon have to negotiate with various countries and persuade them to adopt japanese refugees soon it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of japanese in their country and the chaos that follows if this ever happens touchwood i hope ito misaki will be safe she can always stay at my place hee hee the scenes of evacuations are really well done showing the havoc suffering and desperation civilians have to face in such disastrous times and the many faces of human beings surface arrogance selfishness bribery bravery cowardrybr br this is a really wellmade film the storytelling is solid with an engaging storyline and wonderful acting drtadokoro played by toyokawa etsushi was done really well portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff his frustration and concerns were very visible and thats a really good thing reiko played by gorgeous shibasaki kou was also played rather well and has the most memorable line in the entire movie go watch it to find out and i fancy that she has a nice acting voice she plays the love interest of toshio onodera played by tsuyoshi kusanagi of smap oh i almost forgot she has really really long hair and theres also a subtle but background love story which is well written and if theres something the japanese do really well its love storiesbr br one thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur and if youre interested in geography youll have a really good time i know i did hehe i can see that they went to great lengths to make this movies theory believable and the first few graphical displays and explanation were done rather well although youll have to excuse the japaneses famous engrishbr br ok now about the effects its all about the effects isnt it after watching the movie with pure awe i must say that this movie has special effects that are on par or even better with some hollywood productions the volcanic eruptions the massive earthquakes destruction tsunamis explosions all done splendidly the opening scene is so cool the 1st earthquake catches you by surprise mountains fall the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe to actually watch mount fuji heat up is a marvel then you see shibuya fall to the ground its so sad however what i felt was one of the best scenes was the giant tsunami scene which sees rescue operations fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope to hold on to the ending scene also deserves a mention wonderful stuff if you like effects youll love this moviebr br oh ya every good movie has a great song behind it the seriously addictive keep holding u sung by the supercute and adorable sunmin is a duet with kubota and its simply lovely i feel it suits the movie really well and it shows that no matter what disasters hit us our love and strength would keep us holding on the disaster scenes are handled with orchestra music and at times silence a japanese specialty and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on screen oh and did i mention its a really really really wide screen okla been going on and on about this movie yeah i loved it and hoping to watch again it does have plot holes but its all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie not perfect but really wellmade id give it a 9 out of 10 im glad to say that the most expensive movie in japanese history is also one of their best if you havent watched it you really should today it is a must watch
