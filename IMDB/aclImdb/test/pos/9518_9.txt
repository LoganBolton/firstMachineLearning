this is yet another gem from the pen of daniele thompson  in fact that same year 1999 she wrote and directed la buche the first of three writerdirector credits so far belle maman is first of all french whatever that means which is of course different things to different folks the premise is simple at the altar where he is marrying mathilde seigner the groom vincent lindon gets his first glimpse of her mother catherine deneuve and suffers what the french call a coup de foudre which we know as love at first sight in theory the story is either 1 over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other thompson veers towards 2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like for example deneuves cigarsmoking lesbian mother line renaud in real life if anyone cares renaud is in a longterm relationship with stephane audran who costars here and throws in a brilliant setpiece in a luxuriously appointed mens room at the wedding reception which takes the form of a hilarious songanddance consummate writer that she is thompson also leavens the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally spews out his feelings for deneuve at a family gathering whilst simultaneously wrecking the joint this is one to savour again and again
