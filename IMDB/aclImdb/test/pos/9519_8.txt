wowits been a long time since ive last seen such a hilarious movie like this one ive never been a great fanatic about french movies but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine deneuve i decided to see all of her movies however i didnt think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be lucky me that i bought it even though i had some doubts this is really feelgoodtime film with class and quality there are some great social topics and moral dramas involved that are very close to todays modern way of living which are shown very beautiful and realistic i also liked the dancing scene in the mens room a lot but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to singshe brings it the way she is with lots of grace and modesty at the same timevery tempting further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line renaud who played a fantastic role i didnt even know she actedive only known her for her music so dont wait any longer and go see the movieyoull be surprised in many ways
