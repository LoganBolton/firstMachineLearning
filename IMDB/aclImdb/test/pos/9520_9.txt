or at least you feel pretty high after this movie its the kind of film that the word rollicking really can be applied to though its rollicking in that entirely casual intelligent and openminded way that belongs to the frenchbr br no catherine deneuve does not spend the entire movie high sorry to disappoint any puritans with an agenda but the one scene to which i refer involves all the members of a wedding party  and its a musical number anyway everything fits pretty seamlessly together and the unusual bright colorful family  deneuves mother is a lesbian deneuve her bon vivant daughter alternately entertain and annoy us as real families dobut since its a movie they mostly entertainbr br dont want to say too much about the ending but deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger this is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together the ending is a happy one and like the rest of the movie satisfyingly quirky as well as pitchperfect
