i try to catch this film each time its shown on tv which happily is quite often but i keep forgetting to video it as it is i practically know the script by heart but that doesnt stop me having a good cry in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing whats coming next its such a lovely film  well made well cast good photography i love it one of my top ten films
