what is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge recently my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like raging bull or raiders of the lost ark but this time my vcr took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of lionel jeffries the railway children this is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children a mysterious event with their father relocation to the open fields of england and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains at first glance this seemingly simple childrens film doesnt seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on vhs rarity for some time but within the first fifteen minutes of this film one realizes that it is more than just your common place childrens movie  railway children was created during a time when purity was more than just saying no when family meant everything and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend this is more than an adorable film it has amazing cinematic techniques used it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110minute voyage railway children is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alikebr br there are several moments that stand out proudly in railway children that transform this from mediocrity to excellence  one happens to be our three children bobby phyllis and peter modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness laughter and insight into the world surrounding them but jeffries children prove otherwise from intelligently spoken lines both from acting and the script to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village all the way to the final meeting at that train stop these children are more than just child stars advancing a story they are leading us with emotion persuasion and a realism unseen by todays children there is more imagination packed in this small vhs than i have witnessed in film for years a favorite scene that could have been handled with generality of which i have seen in other films was the birthday scene for bobby the way that jeffries floats her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing keeping our eyes excited about each scene as well as our mind another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for perks when asking one man for a gift jeffries has him merely state no i will not i dont like perks the childrens reaction is hilarious  providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout filmed in the 1970s this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies it is a creative film coupled with great choreography and directionbr br that is to say as much as i loved this film it wasnt perfect jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father but it did feel like the event occurred the children were kept in the dark and it suddenly resolved itself by the end more detail to father not much more would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the childrens reaction also there is one scene in this film one of those grandiose widescreen shots of the english countryside that is just breathtaking but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background it made me chuckle but didnt distract too much from the overall picture cinema like this is sorely missed today and oddly it seems that only the british have the gumption to produce it films like love actually or vicar of dibley demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns places where everyone knows everyone and we arent afraid to be neighborly this is more of a theme that american audiences could have more of  more understanding of what is happening outside instead of remaining secluded to your own eventsbr br overall i loved railway children i didnt know what to expect when i first put it in the vhs player but from the opening scene to the exploding train set to perks birthday jeffries proved that he could handle the most childfriendly story with ease his ability to make the child actors feel like real characters to involve the adults less and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding this is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything disney releases the continually occurring themes of friendship kindness to strangers and forgiveness blasts through the tv with grace and power railway children is more than just a kids film it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing not only does it give a great visual to the english countryside but it also teaches and shows how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage instead of fighting any cgi bad guysbr br grade  ½ out of
