the railway children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the castthe warmhumane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful english countryside jenny augutter is especially believable in her role as bobbie the older sibling of her sister phyllis and brother peterthe adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinatingthe scenery is lovelythe trains a part of britains vast history and the soundtrack is very moving this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyeseach and every time as well as makes me homesicki often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decencybr br in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a sensitive or caring typeedith nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900s and what a wonderful story it ismore kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video gamesif we had more films of this nature the world would become a better place
