long trailer whoever said that has got to be joking this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them then it shows us how woo pings team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded but theres hardly anything really if you are a real fan of the matrix you have to see this documentary the original documentary in the dvd is good but incomplete compared to this one for instance it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary but that is explained in revisited the revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like shes letting the crew down and thats just the tip of the iceberg so ignore that just a long trailer review and go check it out for yourself you wont regret it casual matrix fans need not apply
