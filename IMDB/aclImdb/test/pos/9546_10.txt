i am salivating for the sequels i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension anxiety what if it isnt as good and constant lack of information i needed something to calm me a little something to pass the time other than of course the matrix this was just the thingbr br  i found it informative like the part about keanus neck and some of it was funny i pitied carrieanne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys i found only one problem with it given that 95 of the people there were as a matter of fact male they just kinda let their mouths run wild and there was language in it its not near as bad as the shawshank redemptions cussing runs but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day plug your ears if you are little br br it was entertaining and was just what i needed it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet they mention a tiny bit about the sequels and someone almost gives something away but he catches himself in time shoot it gives you almost no spoilers but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like mebr br  there is no spoon
