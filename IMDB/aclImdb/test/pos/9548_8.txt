i saw the movie in izmir as the closing film of izmir film festival i didnt know anything about it but right now im glad i didnt refuse the chance to see dingalingless it is one of the funniest movies ive ever watched and believe me ive seen zillions of movies im a film critic clever script and dialogs smart details what else can i say an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor one cant stop by wonder what hes capable of right now dingaling less was shot five years ago and im sure the director onur tukel is more mature now i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really cant wait to see that too among with his previous works like house of pancakes
