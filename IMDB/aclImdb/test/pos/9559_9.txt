in an earlier comment i mentioned how much i enjoyed this film  better second time around i dont resile from that opinion strangely i cant find anyone else who did like it br br my mother was going to see it but several friends told her no way my sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out partway through br br my wifes suggestion is that australians see the characters as just normal everyday americans and therefore its not funny but hey most americans think all australians are like crocodile dundee so its nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change
