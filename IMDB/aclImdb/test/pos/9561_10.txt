this flick was even better then waiting for guffman the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levys little secondsecond city troupe if one finds this movie boring or pointless god help em they just didnt get it it is a mockumentary something at which guest and levy have a genius for at the end of the movie where guests southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to israel to work on a caboose or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphicbr br of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in its hand i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living thank you mrguest and mrlevy and god bless you
