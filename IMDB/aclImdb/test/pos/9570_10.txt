this is the best of the films so far that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast previously theyd made the excellent waiting for guffman and following best in show they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind as for their latest for your consideration the less said the betterbr br the film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular you follow these few chosen dogs from preshow preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious mayflower kennel club however none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world amazingly even though the characters are rather outlandish there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodyingas decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very cutthroat group of people my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly highpressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility i also loved the openly gay couple as they were terribly funny and clever however the best performance probably wasnt from any of the couples but from fred willard who played the worlds stupidest and least talented announcer in human history his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid personhow he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyones guess the other contestants featured were also quite funnythe highpriced professional poodle handler and its rich owner the country boy and his hound as well as winkies parents who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the showbr br despite the improvised style of film making the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling storyone that is not for dog owners only exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade clever and consistently funnybr br by the way try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing while a bit painful to watch i loved seeing harlan pepper and his beach ball collection in particular
