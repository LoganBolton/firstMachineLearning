functioning as a sort of midpoint between waiting for guffman and a mighty wind best in show portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper very much trying to promote his dog eugene levy parker posey michael mckean catherine ohara and bob balaban also do great jobs i cant imagine them not doing great jobs at least not in a christopher guest movie as someone whos never attended a dog show this movie is my main exposure to them they sure look neat
