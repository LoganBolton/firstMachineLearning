this is the funniest movie i have ever seen however i have laughed harder at plenty of movies this is because best in shows brilliance lies not in slapstick or oneliners but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke but only until after several jokes build on one another each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you cant help letting loosebr br its a wellshot film but what makes it extraordinary is the acting i was impressed on my first viewing but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised i was amazed it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other build jokes out of nothing and completely immerse themselves in their charactersbr br i imagine the golden days of second city were like this
