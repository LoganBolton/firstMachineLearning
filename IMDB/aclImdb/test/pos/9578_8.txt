ill admit that ive never seen waiting for guffman 1997s critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant when the advertising for best in show had the tagline from the team that brought you waiting for guffman a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film for shame critics for shame times two any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesnt want to share the films wealth with the rest of the world but this is one film that i hope people will experience now that its videodvd best in show is without a doubt the best comedy of 2000br br the film begins with a mockumentary style introducing the main competitors not to mention screwballs of the annual mayflower best in show competition where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog we have the loveable and gullable harry pepper guest with his bloodhound the simple gerry  cookie fleck levy  ohara with their terriors nutcase yuppies hamilton  meg swan hitchcock  posey the gay dog groomers scott dolan  stefan vanderhoof higgins  mckean and the airheaded millionare sheri ann ward cabot coolidge along with her trainer christy cummings lynch they all have their minds on one simple object the blue ribbon which will be awarded to the best dog anddo i have to tell you the restbr br directorwriterstar guests idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that the idiocy of films like american pie or other pointless teenage flicks wont take over the world after all his idea is simple make your comedy not just funny but smart funny but instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like zero effect and high fidelity he used a rather unusual approach and as i understand he also used this approach for guffman whether you notice or not a very large part of the film is improvisation in other words what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script maybe even not even dreamed of by guest and cowriterstar levy but with a gentle hand from guest he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other less adept actors now thats smartbr br the cast is of course what makes improv work the most all of them are a comedic marvel to behold especially guest as pepper but the real standout has to be fred williard as buck laughlin the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream ofthat is if the announcer was trying to be funny williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press theres even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a doggiestyle of a time its priceless as is his performancebr br i hope that people engage in this 90minute dogumentary the film deserves so much recognition it did get nominated for best picturecomedy at the golden globes but didnt win i cant see why i mean in the comedy department it is best in showbr br grade a
