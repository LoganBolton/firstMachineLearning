i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie of course as im sure you know that malcolms in the middle star frankie muniz and the ever so sweet amanda bynes the amanda show starred in this childrens comedy as two friends that im sure that we can all relate to the movie is about a boy jason shepardfrankie and his friend kayleeamandagoing onto an adventure in hollywoodbr br spoilers aheadbr br as it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day lifes problems one day jason is hit by mr wolfthe big bad director jasons english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his fathers trust back they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back and all he has to do is call jasons dad and tell him he stole his idea but the end is no real surprise being the good proveles and winsbr br the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect its rated pg i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies not only is the childrens acting great exceptional casting well written but its good clean fun it made me laugh as well as fall in love with its innocent message i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten the unemployed critic isnt unemployed for nothing i give it well i voted a ten out of ten a perfect
