ok so i admit that it often seems like most of the sylvestertweety pairings have exactly the same plot sylvester tries to get tweety but repeatedly fails and always gets maimed in the process often with the help of a bulldog i guess that its sort of like wile e coyote chasing road runner in other words mammals should never go after birds all a birrrrd has the same plot and sets it on a train in a way the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes sylvester comes up with to try and go after tweety we know that hes going to fail miserably but its also funny to watch tweety turn into a badass if youve seen his really early cartoons youll see that he was not cute at all but in fact had a cruel streak this one mainly works as a way to pass timebr br by the way i thought that i saw  i mean i taut i taw  sylvester pass a piece of baggage with the name friz freleng on it
