friz frelengs all abirrrd is one of the best sylvester and tweety cartoons unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series which simply transplant the same tired gags to a new setting all abirrrd makes the most of its concept tweety and sylvester are domestic pets who are being sent unattended across country by train with both a watchful official and a vicious bulldog to deal with sylvester has his work cut out the sylvester and tweety cartoons always benefited from some extra participants and all abirrrd is a good example of how much these additional characters help although they are not especially memorable creations they throw some more obstacles in sylvesters path and make for a more interesting battle this early sylvester and tweety short presses many of the right buttons and while tweety is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness theres some deliciously violent antics between sylvester and the dog culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which is unfortunately marred by a final unfunny nonquip by tweety
