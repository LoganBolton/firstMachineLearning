i always enjoy watching this cartoon with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train rather than at grandmas house its actually a standard fare but entertaining especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train when you watch this over and over like my little boy did who loves trains which is why he liked it so much you begin to notice some thingsbr br throughout this short the position of the baggage car changes on the train either 3rd 4th or 5th and in long shots not at all the engine has either the number 651 or 814 or none at all the coal tender has either the number 99 or the letters sp  qr on it or no number or letters at all the coaches carry the spqr without the  in long shots and then in closeups it has the words southeast and westernbr br all of this doesnt interfere with the story but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully br br still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety
