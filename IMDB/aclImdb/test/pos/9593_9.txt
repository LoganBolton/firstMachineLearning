i think this tv film was first aired the same week that manchester utd played in the champions league final 1999 they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standoutbr br it played on all the clich√©s that are churned out every season during the fa cup ie plucky underdogs lucky clothingmascots name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funnybr br im surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions even now with the world cup just getting underway br br a few previous posts from nonfootball fans have said they still love it but a football fan will find it hilarious imho
