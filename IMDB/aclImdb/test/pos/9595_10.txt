as a reviewer has already commented this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever buthaving failed to video it when it was first aired i now find that it isnt around in any format ok so this has only polled 17 votes to date but a 9 average does seem to suggest something special basically i suppose its a case of tough luck if you missed it cos its no longer available to view  aaaaaaaargh
