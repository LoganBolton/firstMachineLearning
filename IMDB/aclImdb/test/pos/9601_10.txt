i cant add much to what has been said already except im going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policybr br ive actually got this on a vhstodvd copy but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially releasedbr br i can just imagine what extras i would like to see tim healys character swearing his way through one of those football bloopers type programmes would be great you can imagine it now cant you but of course it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd releasebr br surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at itv who also knows something about british culture is web savvy and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again oh well
