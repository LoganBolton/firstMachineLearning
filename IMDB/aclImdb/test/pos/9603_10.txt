 could it be that itv wouldnt want to release this absolute classic because it would show up their current series of mike bassett for what it is when discussing mike bassett with some work colleagues i mentioned bostocks cup as being a far superior offering and was surprised to find that i seem to be the only person in my entire office that has actually seen it this cant be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seenbr br lets face it itv dont have the greatest recent record for producing comedy so you would think that they would jump at the chance of at least repeating something which is genuinely funny perhaps if it could be combined with a lucrative telephone competition of where we think the coach driver will go next then they might be interestedbr br come on itv there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original quality comedydrama do the decent thing thing repeat it then get it out on dvd
