i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious its not like american pie or something i know not why people are offended by the universal plugs since its part of the plot the advertising is excusablebr br this is a funny movie with good dialogue good subtle wit a good story a good moral that thankfully doesnt get too sappy great acting and a cheesy endingbr br minor spoiler the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy muniz who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf giamatti comes along so he gets his best friend kaylee bynes and they go and drive the wolf crazybr br frankie muniz can be annoying in other roles but not as jason shepherd he handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantnessbr br amanda bynes what more can i say the girls got the gift shes funny talented versatile and very very attractive im only 6 months older than her i need to get to california sometime soon in fact the bestfriend part was originally a boy but became a girl as soon as the makers saw amandas interest which works out pretty well since the part wouldve been pretty dull without the blessing of byness abilitiesbr br paul giamatti is a very talented man while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical giamatti made himnot just a jerk mind you but a likeable jerk a jerk that livens up the screen rather than intentionally dimming it and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf undergoes as wellbr br all in all great movie loved seeing jaleel white able to mock himself loved seeing all the little references  such built into the film one of the guests in the party scene is the director shawn levy another is byness former costar kenan thompson loved seeing amanda in those outfits get the dvd if you can its got all kinds of great extra stuff and the lovely ms bynes is your guide through the menus
