crimson begins with some cool jazzy music so i liked it immediately but as the film wore on i began to wonder if the music wasnt the best part we have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is triggered and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves paul nash jacinto molina whoever he is here gets shot now it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his madscientist friend and wife he is saved with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called the sadist the sadist is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head so to add insult to injury or in this case death they remove his head using a train leaving the body for the authorities to find oops once the brain transplant is complete naschy wants to ravage any woman that comes near him because he now has the mindset of his donor well of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at radio shack and overall its pretty cheesy and sleazy but it has a good early 70s look and feel to it and the music is cool this isnt so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs battling it out over turf and babes and other thugtype things but its strangely entertaining in ways i cant begin to describe 7 out of 10
