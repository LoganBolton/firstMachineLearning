this film is the best kung fu film of all time although there is not wirework and special effects like those used in crouching tiger this movie uses ingenuity and creative camerawork to create memorable fighting moments and the fight scenes are well choreographed and tight there is a ton of action in this film with lots of great fight scenes but the story is very good toowith lots of twists and turns the characters are well rounded and have real depth to them as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in a much greater detail than most kung fu films there is some really great camerawork in the film with my favorite shot starting as a close up on our heros face showing his reaction then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene before him that is the cause of his look originally i bought the movie to hoping see some great fight scenes but upon multiple viewings i learned how terrific the acting and story were as well overall a great film
