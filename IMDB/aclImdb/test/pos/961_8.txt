who said it had to be believable do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film youll enjoy the experience much more youll find yourself forgiving some of the movies more outlandish plot setups and simply accepting it for what it isa great family film i appreciated not having to be concerned about questionable elements in a childrens film for once that to me is worth the price of the ticket and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about itolder chidlren will enjoy this film enough good humor to keep adults interested very good film
