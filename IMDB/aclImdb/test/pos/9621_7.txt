the martial arts movies got huge in the 60s in parts of asia but with the growing popularity of the infamous shaw brothers films america was bound to catch on this movie was the first to be presented in america under the warner bros label and it did in fact start a craze here that flooded the 70s with martial arts films many of the films to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like enter the dragon which came out shortly after this one became huge success stories and made superstars out of these fightersbr br fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds up most shaw brothers films are as good today as they were back then and truth be told no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by the shaw bros back in the daybr br i like to think martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action well same goes with ma films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story this one is an exception it doesnt have an amazing story but there is one therebr br the main guy played by lo lieh actually stands out amongst karate film heroes he never brags and he never fights just because he can he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most but when he must fight he is damn well the greatest alive i really loved this character many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were just presented so amazingly even a small role with bolo yeung can be seen as the huge mongolian and bolo is in my top 5 as greatest martial artist film stars ever he was also in the above mentioned enter the dragonbr br the production as ive said over and over is wonderful you cant beat the shaws the direction was something unlike i have seen much in films of the 70s the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others when the light shines on chi haos hands as he does the iron fist its pure beautybr br the music was superb as well martial arts films were to asia what westerns were to italy two separate art forms with so much in common the countries making these films had all genres but the japanese films were what was making waves there as the spaghetti westerns were in italy with their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck as seen in movies like 5 fingers of death the fights were easily compared to sergia leoni cowboy stand offs and the music tied the genres together so well the music here borrowed a little from ironside but it was still very originalbr br many films were inspired by this one and when i watch it i can see everything from the master killer to bloodsport having been influenced the most obvious movie to have been influenced was kill bill which to me is the greatest of all time many of the sets quentin used are complete replicas of ones seen here and he used the music from this film even though the music he used was the music borrowed from ironside and the fight scene at the end of kill bill vol 1 with the bride and oren is at times exact in comparison to the fight with chi hao and the japanese thug at the end of this moviebr br i have seen many martial arts films a few even better but this is a mustsee for fans of the genre you cant go wrong here the movie starts off slow but 1520 minutes into it it picks up and doesnt slow down
