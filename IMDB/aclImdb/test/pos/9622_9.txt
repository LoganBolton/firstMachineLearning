while its generally acknowledged one of the first martial arts movies to play here in the west its real impact comes in retrospect lo lieh is very low key throughout and many of the fight scenes while often hailed as innovative which they were at the time of the movies initial release are a tad tame compared to what came after particularly after bruce lee who became the instant standard by which all others will forevermore be judged thats not to say that five fingers of deathking boxer is anything less than a classic in its own right because it is like many of the leading characters in many martial arts movies the character lieh plays lays low through most of the movie for a reason but when he cuts loose he effectively cleans house you cant ask for more than that
