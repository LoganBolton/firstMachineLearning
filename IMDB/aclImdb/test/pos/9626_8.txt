i saw five fingers at the drivein inwhat 1973 74 it was the the first kungfu movie id ever seen and i was greatly entertained i recently bought it on dvd and watched it again i was greatly entertained the second time too i believe this is probably the one most kungfu movies are modeled after rival schools different styles revenge white hat good guys and black hat bad guys they even threw in the japanese very bad guys styles of karate and judo i remember being amused by the dubbing dialog along the lines of hey you you are a very bad guy and they should not get away with this i will have a go at this bad crowd this time it wasnt so distracting i guess im used to it if you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre this is one you should see
