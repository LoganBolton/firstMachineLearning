man i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie everyone thinks theyre a critic they comment on things that the average movie goer doesnt even know or think aboutbr br i enjoyed the film it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but thats also a reason to watch whats even more funny is the people that complain about his films say hes the worst and that we shouldnt watch his films yet watch his movies anyway all so they can comment on how bad they are whos the dummy if you dont like his work dont watch it then you wont have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful eventbr br stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again
