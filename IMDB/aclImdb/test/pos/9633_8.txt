basically this is a very good film it is very different from seagals other films though which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans unlike some of the other films this does not feel like a seagal vehicle you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr seagals actions are not the same as weve seen before the concept of him being an intellectual in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change although there are some unrealistic parts to the film some more obvious than others in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watchbr br it boils down to this if you are looking for a classic seagal action film sorry but youre going to be disappointed watch it anyway for the fun of it if youre open to seeing seagal without the action its well worth a look i personally believe it is some of the best work hes done in quite a whilebr br
