i recommend that movie viewers if in the new york city area go to the intrepid museum and get some idea of how closed in and cramped the living was for the crews of world war ii vintage submarines how much more so that must have been for the seamen during world war i it must have truly been hell belowbr br walter huston and robert montgomery head the cast of hell below huston as the by the book captain and montgomery as his free wheeling number two theyre both quite believable as naval officers and the rest of the cast like robert young eugene palette jimmy durante madge evans sterling holloway etc fill their roles quite nicelybr br the silent service got more popular during world war ii and after its amazing but i could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like torpedo run operation pacific hellcats of the navy run silent run deep and many more and youll see the same plot situations in all of them i guess there truly is a limit on situations as wellbr br jimmy durantes performance is interesting hes pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is very funny indeed but id have to say a character like him in those cramped quarters is probably very necessary for morale if you dont have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediatelybr br the highlight for me however is sterling holloways death scene very similar to sean mcclorys in island in the sky it will haunt you long after youve seen this film
