as i type these comments im watching a dvd of this movie that i just got from a mailorder dealer and im finding that it holds up extremely well with strong characterizations believable situations and wellstaged action scenesbr br its been a good 45 years maybe 50 since i saw hell below but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was sterling holloways death scene which several other commenters have mentioned here i havent gotten to that scene yet on this viewing but i can vouch for what other comments have said once you see sterling holloways death scene in this movie you will absolutely never ever forget it judging from how strong the film so far is holding up i fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it  as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history the movies worth seeing for that moment alone but even without it it would be a firstrate early submarine drama
