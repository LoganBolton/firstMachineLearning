i dont have a really solid thesis here so im just going to toss out some observationsbr br first of all the film is absolutely gorgeous its shot in high contrast black and white and some of the scenes are so well composed that theyre almost distractingbr br theres a sequence early on of some intense protests and some of the shots were amazing  three guys launching tear gas at the protesters etcbr br second of all i think that one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film looking back on the 60s is that its really about how the idealism of the revolution morphed and shifted into something different the take on this shift is really interesting  i think that both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more selfindulgent phase have strong points and weak points the film doesnt necessarily take the position that things decayedbr br third i think the romance works very wellbr br finally i really really really hated the ending it was way too melodramatic you could even say that the ending is unworthy of the film that preceded it
