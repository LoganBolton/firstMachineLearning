this is the best french movie of the year  i saw it twice and i found it great both times i didnt think it boring at all even though it is very long 3 hours im seventeen so i obviously didnt get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history but it doesnt really matter since i still really enjoyed the film its actually quite universal  people of my parents age can identify to the characters and so can people my age garrel seems to perfectly understand young people the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world maybe thats because the character played by louis garrel his sonis actually meant to represent philippe garrel himself well anyway great movie no action have to be honest on that point but so strong feelings that you cant possibly stay indifferent to it if youre looking for a relaxing sundayevening movie dont waste your time on this youll be disappointed but if you like cinema youll like les amants r√©guliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50s and 60s by the nouvelle vague artists
