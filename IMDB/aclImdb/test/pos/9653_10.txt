this film is probably the best new french film ive seen in this century so far there have been some great ones including noes irreversible greens le pont des arts and hadzihalilovics innocencebut none of them come close to les amants reguliers timeless glorybr br the movie is a description of the events of may 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the nouvelle vaguemovies of those days concerning the depiction of the riots in paris the movie is meticulously accurate im only 19 and i wasnt there myself but you know what i meanand the almost realtime and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris the riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in bertoluccis the dreamers to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william lubtchansky the love story that is the movies main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environmentbr br this film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60s which makes the film all the more compelling but the film is also a homage to the whole nouvelle vague canon much of the dialogue evokes early truffaut and the length and nonaction and plot less structure is reminiscent of eustache or rivette there are even godardlike verfremdungeffects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing bernardo bertolucci directly this film is no doubt an answer song to bertoluccis the dreamers and it is also a nouvelle vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love storybr br bottom line this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldnt sleep on it it may be the finest french film since eustaches la mamain et la putain
