this a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart i got lost in this sweet film watching it at the manns chinese theatre in hollywood its truly romantic with a touching messagethe artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so apparent the frames are like watching moving art it also has a strong and talented cast of actors what a wonderful surprise to see joss ackland he is just a fairytale perfect king sarah douglas is terrific as the villain and christine taylor and tom schultz make a lovely romantic pair the fact that the movie was made on a ridiculously tiny indie film budget just blows me away it may not be the slick hollywood stuff were inundated by but its a really nice movie to rent and enjoy curled up on your sofa on a rainy saturday dont forget the microwave popcorn thats my advice just enjoy it
