my teacher did this movie its a new beginning watch it and you wont notice that it is a romanian movie the old boring style has gone now its something else a postrevolutionary movie it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists they are unique you wont even know that youre watching you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and youll feel every frame dont miss it pay attention to the plot but dont ignore the details they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies you will hear some music at some point its representative for a part of us but it does not represent us please just keep your head straight and leave your body free
