i have to say that i havent expected that this movie to be this good usually the eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90 of the films however this film surpasses the romanian cinema being worthy of some more advertisement br br the acting is truthfully and not exaggerated the plot is simple yet complex as it presents the life in the romanian suburbia the sound amazed me the directing was good and what more can i say br br this crash of eastern europe was drawn me into the film living each moment of it i have even felt a desire coming out of me a desire for adventure after seeing itbr br watch it you will definitely enjoy itbr br 710
