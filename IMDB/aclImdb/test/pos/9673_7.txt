i own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say vol 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all there are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think vol 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs at least for mebr br the biggest annoyance i had with vol 6 is it seems to be very heavy in left wing politics im a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this volume really seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show insinuated all conservative sates are horrible places insinuating we need more gun control insinuated school are under funded insinuated religious people are crazy bush is friends with the devil i could go on and this is just from the first three episodesbr br sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when youre not making a comedy and youre really just shoving your political views on other people
