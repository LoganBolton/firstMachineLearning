big fat liar is a pretty funny movie but as i was watching it i thought about something some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable so really the film is kind of a big fat lie there is no way that he couldve gotten away with all of this here are all of the unbelievable stuffbr br 1 when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball and acts like he is the father jasonfrankie munez couldnt have gotten away with that well luckily for us he didnt so it didnt stick with it the outrageousbr br 2even if the grandmother was blind she still couldve figured out that that wasnt her granddaughter br br 3they couldnt have gotten on the plane flown to la acted like they were coat salesmen sneak into the studio and then and then well some of the film is a little unbelievable but it doesnt hurt to tell a little white lie trust me i do it all the timebr br big fat liar though unbelievable at times is fun its also very funny but let me just say one thing before i continue this review if paul giamatti wasnt in this movie it would really suck it would be horrible big fat liar is also pretty funny though corny at times i give it a thumbs upbr br big fat liar
