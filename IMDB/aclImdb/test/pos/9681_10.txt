family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost its sharp and random humor at the start of season 6 although i enjoyed blue harvest it felt like the remaining episodes were wrappingup  episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guys reputation of american social satirebr br i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now  more funbr br i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together this show however has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be great job
