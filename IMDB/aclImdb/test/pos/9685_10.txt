this movie was borderline in crude humori utterly can not believe that these people can get away with this johnny knoxville didnt cross the linehe was stomping all over it this was better than the firstall tha way the thing i found about the 1st movie was that the shenanigans were somewhat as if it was on the tv show not this time they completely made a 180 degree flipthe whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and not were the stunts crazybut the music basically fit every situationgood work when you go see this be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater maintain a strong stomach and rememba to not let your beverage spray out your nose
