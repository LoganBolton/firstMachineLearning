seriously people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny and this movie is fking hilarious better than the first and knoxville really grew a pair for this film and did way more crazier stunts then the first if ebert and ropernot saying that im a huge fan of theirs can look past the pure idiocy of this film enough to give it 2 thumbs up then i think other people can to i wasnt sure what to expect from this but i was floored and it is rare when a sequel is better than the original this new one i believe exceeds the first big time so do what i didjust relax kick back try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass off
