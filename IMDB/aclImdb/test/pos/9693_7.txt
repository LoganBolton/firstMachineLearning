this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention its not going to win any oscars  its really not a very good movie at all heck its not even really a movie  just a string of short disgusting grossout skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it im going to give it a much better score the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so im not going to give some snobby critique of jackasss quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our societyoh forget itbr br whats to say theres no plot development no character development  no real beginning  theres a semienjoyable end thats not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it and everything in between reeks of improper bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at its actually pretty funnybr br leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie jackass number two is just grossout crap thats really all it is i do give the filmmakers this though they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff youll probably cringe several times throughout want to throw up a couple times wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomitdefying stunts vomit crap urine semenvirtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass number two theres nudity sexual humor abounds and so on and so forthbr br its entertaining if youre the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable then you will probably really like jackass number two i laughed several times like i said its pretty imaginative stuff i never once wanted to vomit  though i do have a pretty strong stomach just accept the movies premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun once you get past that accepting it and going with it youll enjoy it the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff there are several very imaginative very disturbing skits but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting towards the end things pick up but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall films quality in a half hour tv show this isnt a problem but with film length celluloid its inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point after awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizingbr br on the whole though number two is an entertaining imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain nausea and hilarity go see it if you must but hey if you know you dont like this kind of stuff dont bother youll just be disappointed
