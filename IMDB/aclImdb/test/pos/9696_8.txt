ive always been a fan of jackass as well as viva la bam and wildboyz and when youre a fan of something your expectations are high to whatever your heroes might star in and if theres one thing ive learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to its never to expect to much cause in 99 out of a 100 times youll get disappointedbr br although when i heard there was a jackass 2 coming up i thought not even i can turn down my expectations for this movie and as a result of that i sat down today ready to laugh but also ready to say in the end well it was ok but im a little disappointed how wrong was i every single member of the jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other making the whole world see that theres nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves  and thats what we love i cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie at some times even shouted in laughter not able to control myself stunt after stunt prank after prank and hilarious comments on the flow  it can simply not get any better than this amazing from start till end guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off ive got two things left to say watch it and please god let there be a jackass 3  these guys clearly has a lot to offer
