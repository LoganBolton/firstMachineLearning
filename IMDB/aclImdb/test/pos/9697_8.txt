this movie was hilarious it occasionally went too far but isnt that what we expect from them the theater roared with laughter and ooooooed at all the incredibly crazy stunts its rude crude and occasionally frighteningly intense the whole gang is back and even more out of their minds which in turn provides for some great entertainment i dont want to give anything away but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after br br this is a great movie to go see with friends try to see it with a big crowd you will not be disappointed just dont go with anyone who cant take it see above it will not go over well you can be sure of that but thats pretty obvious in the first place if you enjoyed the first one you will loooooove this one
