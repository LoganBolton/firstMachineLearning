big fat liar in my opinion is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it when jason frankie muniz  malcolm in the middle and kaylee amanda bynes  all that played those tricks on marty paul giamatti  doctor dolittle i really smiled and felt good thats what i liked most about this movie as a matter of fact everything that happened after jasons essay erroneously ended up in martys hands was hilarious i especially loved jaleel whites cameo when i first saw him i couldnt be certain but when i asked my mother if it was him she said of course before i wrap this up id like to say like i said earlier there is a moral to this story and that moral is always tell the truth now in conclusion if you are a fan of frankie muniz amanda bynes or paul giamatti i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it
