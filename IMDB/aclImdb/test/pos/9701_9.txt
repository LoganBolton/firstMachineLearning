ive been a huge fan of the cky videos jackass and viva la bam for a long time theyve had a great run and i expected my laughter to end eventually but it hasnt yet this movie kept my mouth open the entire time im still laughing randomly i went to the theater with low expectations thinking it wasnt going to be better than the first oh how incredibly wrong i wasbr br there were many great moments in the movie if youre squeamish dont like randomly placed raw humor or if you disliked the first movie you probably wont like this but with that said i almost wet my pants from laughing so hard it had all kinds of different pranks masochistic humor toilet humor puking laughing some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast ryan dunn even branded bams rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time im sure you can only imagine how raw this movie isbr br no pain no gain right this movie has already done well causing theaters all over america to laugh so hard theyll be wishing it could last longer i know i did this movie did not feel short at all especially with the credits continuing the footage but i still wish it couldve gone on forever now lets just wait and see when they release jackass number 3 overall an excellent film if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images keep your kids out of this film they dont need to see this at least until they are older support the crew and buy this when it comes out on dvd i know i will
