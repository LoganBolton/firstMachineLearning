johnny knoxville has gone insanebr br in the first jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme candid camera  but in jackass number two hes really off his rockerbr br beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull or later when he rides a rocket a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach knoxville is a madman in the first film bam margera and steveo  notorious party animals  were the daring ones but you know its pretty bad when you see knoxville enticing them to do a stuntbr br this is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone constantly trying to oneup each other it will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in jackass 2 steveo nearly loses a leg to a shark knoxville as aforementioned is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket and so on and so forth jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2 and frankly i cant imagine any stunt outperforming the bull run in the opening scene of this film  thats incredible footage its almost unbelievable and i wondered whether it had been faked but apparently it was 100 genuine which is actually kind of frightening and in terms of extremes jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original mtv television showbr br unfortunately the boys were given too much freedom here and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  i can enjoy the occasional poop gag but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or see steveo take beer up the butt yes honestly gets grating after a while even the frat boys in the screening i attended  who were enthusiastic when wee man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film its not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  its a matter of saying is this even entertaining or funny many times sadly it really isntbr br but for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on peoples faces there are some brilliant hiddencamera bits wacky director spike jonze adaptation dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked with sagging breasts and no shame and my personal favorite skit involved knoxville as an irresponsible old man out for lunch with his grandson letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people thats classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an rrating its a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the waybr br still theres enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing and its really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights
