yes bam cried a couple times and so did englund and most probably you will too the whole cast is back in action and knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messedup retards i mean this in the best possible way i first thought maybe bam or steveo were the main goto guysnope the main man is now johnny dont get me wrong everybody and i mean everybody is great in this flick right from the getgo youre laughing and believe you me dont plan on resting that smile of yours i personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first you know when you go into a theater and you kind of dont want to have high expectations for itwell this movie blows all expectations away if you love jackass you can go into this with gigantic expectations no matter what youll laugh your ass off if youre not laughing the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating jack sht for breakfast and jack left town all i have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie
