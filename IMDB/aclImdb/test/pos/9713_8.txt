this movie blew me away  i have only seen two episodes of the show never saw the first movie but went to a prescreening where johnny knoxville himself introduced the movie telling us to turn off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half he was right as a movie this would probably rate a 2 given it has zero plot no structure besides randomness and very little production value however that isnt the point everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through  not only were some of the stunts creative see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best or worst depending on how you want to look at it but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise these guys do some stuff that wont make it into your newspaper reviews and probably cant even be published here involving lots of things below the belt however almost 34 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical even if morally condemnable but remember knoxvilles statement and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on tv so consider yourself warned of what youre getting into  some stuff is disgusting but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all as a person who thought jackass the tv show was an overhyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain the amount of fun i had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in its a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the borat movie comes out with this movie you may think you know what youre getting but these guys are a few steps ahead of you  i guarantee youll be surprised by the 3rd sketch so enjoy and dont worry you wont want to perform almost any of their stuff at home
