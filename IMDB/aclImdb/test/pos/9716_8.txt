it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed racer be it dubbed or subbed i prefer the dubbed version which is rare because it was funnyin a good way whats great about speed racer is that youre never too old to watch it go red and yellow i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening it disappeared for some time then i saw it again a couple of months ago im 19 imagine the feeling of nostalgia surging in singing here he comes here comes speed racer hes a demon on wheels over and over again anyway the concept of the mach 5 spawned so many ultramultifunctionspecialcars but none were able to surpass its genius in construction the other cars just seemed too much and it wasnt just the races or battling different bosses that made it interesting for me it was racerxs mystery persona and how the world of speed racer pretty much happened to revolve around it they did some tweaking to some story lines from the manga but it all turned out pretty well though i cant remember if the show actually revealed how racerx looked like in the manga they did
