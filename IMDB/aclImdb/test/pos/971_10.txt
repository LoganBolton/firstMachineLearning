i love this movie br br yes the main character lies but thats why its called big fat liar even though this kid runs away to hollywood it doesnt give kids the idea that they can besides he doesnt just do it for fun or to get away from anything he does it to regain trust br br i dont think it was just one big ad for universal studios because i liked how it gave an inside view of what its like for kids who dont know how cool moviemaking is br br it has good music and fun characters this familycomedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike it has humour excitement and real life difficulties like lyingbr br in the end big fat liar sends out a moral dont expect lying to be easy
