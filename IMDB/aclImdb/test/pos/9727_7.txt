apparently a b movie b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget a pictures today modernday movies aimed at young women surely arent designed to encourage depth of character over shallow selfserving behavior or increase the selfesteem of young girls who dont conform to feminine standards after all criticizing the fake and flashy like this movie does aint gonna help sell more products that depend on girls not being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty br br laraine day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who bounds into rooms and confesses to an inability to flirt she bonds with robert cummings due to similar interests a shared sense of humour and her honesty loyalty and good friendship which he gradually comes to value over the superficial charms of her selfish glamourgirl sister who only brings out his own selfish reckless playboy tendenciesbr br although laraine is outwardly beautiful as well its refreshing to see inner beauty valued more and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship i wish young girls and guys were getting this kind of downtoearth message todaybr br maybe if hollywood returns to making b movies again with modest budgets and tries to be content with modest profits what am i saying sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smallerscale would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him thats crazy talkbr br please somebody invent a time machine already i belong in 1940br br id rate this movie higher but the ending is a bit too abrupt and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of robert cummings change of heart i like the fact that b movies are short  snappy not bloated  selfindulgent but this one mightve needed more than 70 minutes also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected by a sudden death in their familyor be so forgiving of the one who caused it i mean i guess its nice but a little more grieving or bitterness wouldve been only natural maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure we forgive those involved in the death  since its just a plot device anyway not the real point of the film still strange though
