robert cummings laraine day and jean muir star in and one was beautiful a 1940 film also starring billie burke at one hour and 15 minutes this looks to have been a b movie cummings is a playboy ridley crane whom many women desire including two sisters katherine and helen latimer day and muir katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars and helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns ridley arrives back in town and believing hes not going to be at a party helen decides not to attend since the party is given by a family friend their mother burke sends katherine in a pinned up dress ridley is there and the two connect but ridley is into more superficiality and when he sees helen at a dinner party the two pick up where they left off and go to a club he becomes terribly drunk and helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he wont let her drive after walking awhile and breaking the heel of her shoe she gets into ridleys car when he drives by he passes out and she takes over the wheel accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclistbr br ridley cant remember anything so helen lets him take the blame for the death the heel of a womans shoe is found in the car and katherine sees her sister bury her shoes  plus something in helens manner makes her realize that helen isnt telling the truth ridley is convicted and goes to prison and helen marries a man she doesnt love and leaves for south americabr br this is a wonderful film even though at the time this wasnt an alist cast cummings is playing a part that robert taylor would have played its an mgm film  hes handsome and very amiable even if he doesnt have the dazzling looks of someone like taylor laraine day is a favorite actress of mine someone mgm loaned out constantly because they didnt know what to do with her why i wonder  a wonderful actress with a great face and voice she livened up many a film this one is no different her katherine is determined sympathetic and totally lovely jean muir is a lousy actressbr br so who was the beautiful one we all know even if mgm didntbr br highly recommended little gem
