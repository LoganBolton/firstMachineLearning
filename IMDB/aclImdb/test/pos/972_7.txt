this isnt a lifechanging movie its not an epic or anything like that but its entertaining and its fun its a film that the whole family can watch together and at the moment there are precious few kidsuitable films that dont have a love story in them it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with overthetop special effects like lots of films these days are its got some fairly good acting in and all the music thats been used fits in pretty well with the movie content the acting is quite good too the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny id recommend it for people of all ages  it certainly made me laugh
