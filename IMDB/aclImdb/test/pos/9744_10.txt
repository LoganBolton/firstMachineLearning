arguably the finest serial ever madeno argument here thus far about earthman flash gordon professor zarkov and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in spellbinding spectacular and actionpacked chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin prince thun and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness auranow shes a car this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget  it is miles ahead in these areas produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few the production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for 1936 the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and firstrate we get hawkmen shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons octasacks orangapoids and tigronsoh myand many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and firstrate special effects no way but for 1936 most are very impressive the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are wellwritten lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymonds phenom comic strip lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents  here most everyone has some ability dont get me wrong this isnt a shakespeare troupe by any means but buster crabbe does a workmanlike likable job as flash he is ably aided by jean arden priscella lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later the shorts crabbeand unfortunately for all of us professor zarkovfrank shannon wears are about as formfitting a pair of shorts guys can wear the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming officious sardonic merciless and fun middleton is a class act jack tiny lipson plays king vultan boisterous rousing hilarious  a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism lipson steals each and every scene he is in the plot meanders here there and everywhere  but flash gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow excellent
