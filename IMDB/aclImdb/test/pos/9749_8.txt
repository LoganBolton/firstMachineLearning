my friend gives me these 3 huge boxes theyre laserdiscs of flash gordon serials he says im gonna have some giant coasters i say but not so this serial rocks but i had to whine  moan to almost everyone i knew to find a laserdisc player for embr br there is really a little of everything in this serial there are lionmen hawkmen sharkmen earthmen  i guess youd call em mongomen the sets  costumes combine greek roman oriental egyptian and theres even armour like english knights awesome costumes and some of it was a riot those horrible tights with shorts over em worn by zarkov are beyond description and the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxersbr br its also funny the way they renamed the octopus to an octosack the orangutan to orangapoid and the tiger to a tigron theres even a dragon a godzillalike creature who threatens flash on a couple of occasions before being killed offbr br you like the invisible man this has got you covered you like sword fights wrestling both animals  men fist fights plenty for any taste we have an underwater city a sky city a city on top of a mountain and tonnes of secret passages and cavesbr br hokey effects massive amounts the sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like oldtime steamships the rocketships are powered by fireworks and have constant backfires andor humming noises lots of wires are visible holding things up like food when flash was invisible and of course rocketships theres clouds out in space but none around the earth when viewed from mongo giant lizards show up briefly fighting sea creatures supposedly threaten flash  co on the way to the sharkmens underwater city the gadgets in dr zarkovs lab crack me up and they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab hes in he worked in mings lab and vultansbr br and yeah we have romance everyone wants dale ming vultan flash but at least one person wanted princess aura prince baron just not the person she would have preferred in fact it seems a lot of the subplots concern intrigue on the part of princess aura to try to win flashbr br man i think the characters are awesome that fat horselaughing king vultan was hilarious how he managed those wings was pure artistry and ming what can i say about ming he was perfect they should have had him for the emperor in starwars ming has got to be my favourite character in this serial princess aura was quite a little character too and she pulled it off nicely i think shes a better actress than dale arden by a long shot even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role zarkov was good but not the strongest characterand he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding dale now we get to flash flash of course was the strong point the leader the heroand he did it well crabbe is a good actor and this role fit him perfectlybr br after watching this i think i know where george lucas got the main idea for starwars watch this youll see what i meanbr br if you ever considered watching an old serial or any serial for that matter this should be your first choice the only reason i didnt give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily the way the giant lizards seemed just tacked in there and a couple of weak characters king of sharkmen  king of lionmen
