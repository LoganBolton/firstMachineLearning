this was a thoughtful and wellshot and directed tv movie that took on a huge subject with precision and intelligence and gives it a film treatment that would look great on a bigger screen  the palette is a little muted for tv if youre looking for a war action film or bosnia lite this isnt for you  its about an ordinary woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity if you want to learn more about the conflict and how the work of one woman influenced the world in a massive way watch this film when it comes your way i dont see that a lot of other tv films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level the story avoids obvious demonization of the bad guys and instead shows the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in deaths of thousands i was moved at several points and not in some manipulative hollywood way with driving music and flashy miseenscene but allowed to discover the horror and implications along with the characters this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the visuals understated to support it with dignitybr br the actors do a helluva job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life the scenes where victims give their testimony before the war tribunal are powerful and wendy crewson stipe erceg and heino ferch are excellent william hurts british accent is awful  no one else has given him a chance to play a brit and when he finally has it he blows it  and although john corbetts body was born to play a soldiercommando hes a little too geewhiz nice although he does a good job
