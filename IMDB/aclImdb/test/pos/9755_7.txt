if love me tonight is the musical for people who dont like musicals it has to be said that the gay desperado is definitely not a musical for people who dont like opera in fact  despite apparently being based on a comic operetta  it is not really a musical at all but a spoof bandit story with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character and what a voice it isbr br nino martini as the young singer chivo who joins the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio no the plot doesnt make a lot more sense later on either has a glorious golden tenor whose style hasnt dated a day since the era when it was recorded the trillings and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a bygone fashion but its very easy to picture chivo belting out nessun dorma to a world cup crowd and topping the charts in the process unfortunately while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time the result is that the otherwise rapidpaced film grinds to a shuddering halt every time chivo lays his hand on his breast and starts to declaim and the viewers tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performancebr br aside from this drawback the film is an enjoyable broadbrush satire on hollywood conventions and the mexican bandit stereotype in particular which achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engaging enough in their own right to hold the viewers interest when the joke would otherwise have grown stale the bandit chief and his sidekick have the traditional doubleact relationship there is an enigmatic peon with a carvedteak face and a spirited heroine a young ida lupino who performs the generic you say you hate me but you love me really routine with a refreshing twistbr br overall the film is entertaining and pretty funny and i feel i did get my moneysworth  but it cant be denied that the musical interludes while admirable in their own way introduce severe pacing problems
