i cant understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5210 it really is great very funny i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you adults teenagers and especially children br br the story is about a 14yearold kid who always tell lie at home and school one day he had his homework of writing a 1000wordstory but he didnt so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours or he would have to go to summer school yep he wrote it in 245 big fat liar i think it was a story of himself on the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer and he gave him a ride but the kid forgot the story in the limo he told his parents and the teacher but of course they did not believe him and the movie producer he took the kids story as his new movie big fat liar when the kid saw the trailer of the movie he told his parents he had written it but they didnt believe so he and his friend had to go to la to prove one thing the truth is never overrated br br enjoy this great movie you wont be disappointed dont trust the 5210 rate it should be 910 believe me br br ps so sorry my english isnt good enough to make a better comment
