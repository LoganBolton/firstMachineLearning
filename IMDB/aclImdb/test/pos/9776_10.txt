as soon as i saw the ad for changi on the history channel i knew id love it it captured the anzac spirit fantastically  you would die if you didnt have mates around you the characters of changi were strong and each brought something different into the story and the japanese soldiers werent criticised but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right just as the australians were doing direction screenplay acting and setting were all done wonderfully with a clear easytofollow plot humour was the soldiers key to survival and it was great to see a miniseries about war actually have some sort of humour in it which is usually difficult to do without offending people from what ive read about soldiers in changi pow camp this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those australian british new zealand american and dutch men spent there i would recommend this series to anyone whether you are interested in war or not 1010
