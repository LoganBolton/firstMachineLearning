my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went throughbr br my own father spent some time in changi before going onto the thailandburma railway in f force much as been said about the treatment the pows received i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when singapore fell at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbsbr br no show could truly convey what the pows went through but this comes closer than mostbr br as the ex pows say if you didnt have mates you didnt survive this show succeeds in getting this message across
