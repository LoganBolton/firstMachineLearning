milo is an overlooked  underrated horror flick from the late 90s but the feel and atmosphere is more that of an 80s horror flick seems a bunch of little girls are taken to see things at the office of milos father a gynecologist and as a reward for getting to see whats there in jars yes a gynecologist plus something else one girl plays doctor with milo hmm his first patient and he lost her now milo is a creepy little kid that always wears a yellow rain slicker rain or shine and he talks funnybut thats not all thats strange about him fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and theres a wedding planned for one of them but tragedy strikes and leaves one girl that came in from out of town with a choice of whether or not to replace her friend as a school teacher which she does and then strange things begin to happen again which of course involve this little kid in a rain slicker this isnt overly violent or graphic but has a distinct creepiness that you dont find in many modern horror flicks and its well worth seeing one wonders why its so hard to find any good horror flicks in this day  age but heres one thats criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you check it out 8 out of 10
