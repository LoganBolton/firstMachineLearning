i consider myself a huge horror movie fan one night i wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of then i rented milo i was so surprised by this movie it scared the hell outta me thats not something i can say very often usually halloween only scares mebr br two other friends watched it with me and were left with a disturbed feeling a good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie if you are unaffected then whats the pointbr br this movie was original it didnt follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie thats why movies like valentine bombed for mebr br of course many are left with unanswered questions as most horror movies do it is worth the rent though
