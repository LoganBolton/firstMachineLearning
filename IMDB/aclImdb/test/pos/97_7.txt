well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area  disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny br br back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversabr br maybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughbr br the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada
