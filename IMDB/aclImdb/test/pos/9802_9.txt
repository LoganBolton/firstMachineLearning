my take on the ending bobby died at the hands of his step father mike had tried as he may to get bobby out only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly bobby died mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mindon how bobby leftmike made a plane that flew bobby out children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survivebr br was also great seeing my old housing area we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the housesnot studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room and those hillswe use to hike them as kidslooking down on our little valleyseeing glimpses of the bay was a real nostalgia trip for me
