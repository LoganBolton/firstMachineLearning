this movie was a heartfelt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that shaped who tom hanks was using a very cryptic story they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom hanks character as a child and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth in all good conscience i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10 great performances from all the actors and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father and tom hanks covers it up using a farfetched story about a flying machine pay close attention to the little details such as the turtle that he still has even though his brother flew off with it truly a beautiful piece of cinema and every actor deserves recognition for it
