i am surprised that so many viewers didnt find all the symbolism in the movieits what made the movie an incredible work of art the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold yet it is one of the best movies ive ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storylinebr br if you will pay close attention the message is there the younger brother is killed by the stepfather the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brothers death there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story to me the answer is because he doesnt want to share such ugliness with his own children or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety ive read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered although this is an interesting idea  i love the imagination used to come up with that i dont think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother but i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brothers death however i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at allbr br there are many different takes you can have on the movie but if you take the movie at face valuetwo brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather  youve missed the brilliance the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it workdig deep when you watch it youll be amazed at the genius contained in the film the only other movie ive seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantvillebut thats a comment for another movie
