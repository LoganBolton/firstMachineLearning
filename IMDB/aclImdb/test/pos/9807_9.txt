you got it right bobby was mikes imaginary friend through the whole movie even at the beginning when on their way to california his mother knew of bobby and didnt discourage mike leaning on bobby since imaginary friends are common with young childrenbr br thats why they both got stomach aches at the same time thats why the boys were so closebr br at the end mike was letting bobby go the king was arrested mike could go on without bobby its also why mikes mother didnt seem disturbed when mike received the postcard mike had written  mailed from bobby the ol west tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world you noticed mikes mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark what a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixtiesbr br a 9 out of 10 for me brought back memories
