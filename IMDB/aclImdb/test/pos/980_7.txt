i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver the screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 x 10 so i really wasnt going to watch it but i like malcolm in the middle so i thought id watch just a few minutes next thing i know im sucked in having a great time and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment being one of the older baby boomers i was also pleased to see lee majors with a role in the movie as with a couple of other actors who were famous jamiel yesterday but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselvesbr br its your basic kid is wronged kid gets even and then some and everyone enjoys themselves in the process no heavy thinking no great analysis needed just a good fun way to pass the timebr br 35 out of 5
