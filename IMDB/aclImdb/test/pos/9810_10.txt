spoiler nothing but spoilerbr br i have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just dont get it but no one has even mentioned the s word so far as i have seenbr br while i agree that the kid died i think we can be more specific he committed suicide he races down the slope in an old wagon shoots off the cliff andflies away maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a wagon as laid out in either case he flies away cmon not that tough a metaphorbr br maybe i just have a thing for tom hanks but i was ok with the narration besides he is raising  for the ww2 memorial and you gotta love him for thatbr br oh yeah i loved the movie and found it incredibly moving
