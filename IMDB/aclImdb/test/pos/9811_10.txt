im not sure as to call this movie a childrens drama or a fantasy film when i first watched this i couldnt really make out the ending and thats the only part of movie thats seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile then i watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the meager attention it did at the timebr br unforgettable performances by the young mazzello and wood should have made this film a classicbr br although the it was probably intended to be a fantasydrama by the original writerdirector evans once donner took over he presumably made it with a more dramatical outlook especially the ending which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to bobby  was he killed did he escape  really do all those fantastic journeys or was it just an imaginary story woven by hanks to prove a point to the kidsbr br but in all it didnt provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a childrens film perhaps its because its not just thatbr br to see what may have been a more classical ending check out the official elijah wood site where youll find the first rough draft script of the conclusion of the moviepresumably by the original writerbr br also a note of the music by hans zimmer which is one the best soundtracks ive ever heard a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie a great cd to get hold of if you canbr br
