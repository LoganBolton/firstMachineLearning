this bittersweet slice of magic realism had a checkered production history directorwriter replaced and tanked at the box office but its a helluva filmbr br elijah wood and joseph mazzello are preteen brothers whose flaky mom lorraine bracco shacks up with a meanspirited alcoholic adam baldwin during his drinking bouts baldwin physically abuses mazzello and manipulates him into remaining silent about his situation but when wood cottons on to whats happening the boys put their heads together and hatch a fantastique solution to mazzellos devastating dilemmabr br i love films that mix fantasy and dark reality they are rarely successful financially lawn dogs is a similar example but they are usually original and intriguingbr br the drunk baldwin is shot from a low childs perspective and his head is deliberately lopped off below the top of frame this device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally physicalized beast both wood and mazzello are excellent and they pull us effortlessly into their dark frightening worldbr br the radio flyer of the title is a small red wagon kids transport their belongings in here it transports a dreambr br seriously interesting stuff
