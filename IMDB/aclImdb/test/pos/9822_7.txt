ive read approximately 10 reviews of this film but havent taken any of them to heart harrison ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and i really dont see what any of these things have to do with the film as i recall he had bad hair plus bad reviews in blade runner but its still a favorite among us videophiles it is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the trashings it has receivedbr br i would gladly pay 750 just to watch a bald harrison ford mow his lawn
