i read the other comments here about this movie before watching it if youve read them you will know that they are almost all negative i really dont understand that i admit that it is far too long it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit the music is often inappropriate but strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this with all his fame as a movie star id forgotten that harrison ford really can act this role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable i find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous this movie is never going to be on anybodys list of great flicks but it isnt that bad im glad that i waited to see it on video but it is worth the 3 or 4
