random hearts snuck up on me criticized for the implausibility of a the premise and b the pairing of an ia cop and a congresswoman as well as for its slowness the film felt just fine to me  and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between fords and thomass lives as they first found out about and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with their spouses deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people it could happen two peoples philandering spouses could be on the same plane the plane could go down the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath so what if its improbable improbable is not the same as farfetched sowhat if it did happen why not speculate br br fords and thomass performances are believable and nuanced instead of finding their coupling implausible opposite sides of the tracksgive me a break i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally either where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation personal and professional but never seems to pursue any of them very far and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the partbr br for five and a half bucks at walmart with full length director commentary and behindthescenes featurette the dvd is well worth owning i dont think i would pay 20 for it on a bet but my wife might ok ten
