i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many many years now so it didnt surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done i dont know whether i buy into kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman i took notice of her in the first mission impossible although her part was small she stuck out on the screenbr br here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off apparently ford a police detective in wash dc discovers that his wife was having an affair he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswomanbr br the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages the uncovering of deceipt and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved onebr br i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable
