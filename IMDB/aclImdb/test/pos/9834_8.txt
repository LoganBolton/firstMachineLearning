true there are some goofs for the one who wants to find them theyre not important thoughbr br the primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft kristin scott thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman but one who has been hurt same for harrison ford who for the ladies is just as beau as kristin is belle for us guysbr br their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner but one in which they find support in each other how they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers the viewer cannot help but feel what they feel nor can one help wanting to cheer them when theyre togetherbr br yes there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops but they only spice it up a little and are not a significant part of the moviebr br for the lover of music dave grusin provides a superb jazz based background featuring trumpeter terrence blanchard like the actors grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business blanchard shows why hes one the premiere trumpeters on the scenebr br not a movie for the lovers of guts blood and gore but for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside watch a beautiful english actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act like harrison ford to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of dave grusin and terrence blanchard this is a move to watch with someone you love preferably in bedbr br i thought it deserved at least an 8
