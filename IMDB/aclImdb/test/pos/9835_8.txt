as a fan of history mythology and fantasy mystic knights show pulled me in from the getgo it has semidecent scripting the costumes are fantastic there are exceptions it has pretty good acting and the heroes and villains all play well off each otherbr br scriptshalf a script is pretty great the other half falls flat but its all mixed together meaning many episodes turn out soso also some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines king conchobar and angus for instance they need to be given something more im not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something actingapart from some over acting by villagers horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on everyone good and bad works well together costumesweaponsthe everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular mystic knight armor that falls short are deirdres and garretts a chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case and wouldnt look as plastic his looks like bunch of snapittogether pieces of brown plastic when it should look bronze ivars trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while garretts weapons look cool they also look plasticbr br recently mystic knights has taken on too many power rangers traits if you watch the show youll know what i mean as the series progresses though it should find its niche and perfect its style overall it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy most of my friends and i watch it and were all 20 the plot thickens and twists though it gets a bit juvenile in places and everything just keeps getting more interesting it might be of some interest to fans of the movie willow or the tv series the adventures of sinbad a lot of adventure a dab of mystery a dash of romance a sprinkling of forces at nature check it out my score 710
