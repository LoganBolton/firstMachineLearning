the mayor of hell has the feel of an early dead end kids film but with a much harder edge and very few light spots preceding the first appearance of the dead enders by four years james cagney has a full screen opening credit even though technically the mayor of the movies title is actually portrayed by frankie darro one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes darros character is jimmy smith a young tough whos befriended by patsy gargan cagney and is elected to the position when gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatorybr br warner brothers made a lot of these types of films attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty this movie is quite gritty with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school the rules at the reformatory are simple enough  work hard and keep your mouth shut step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson dudley diggesbr br cagneys role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory on the outside hes still nominally in control of a criminal racket the films attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like thisbr br warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled crime school featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role and billy halop in the frankie darro part if youre partial to the dead end kids youll probably like the latter film better since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey huntz hall bobby jordan and gabriel dell however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too with bogarts warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters in mayor madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagneys characterbr br curiously a lot of james cagneys early films arent commercially available so youll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics or source the film from a private collector personally i cant get enough of this kind of stuff and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties
