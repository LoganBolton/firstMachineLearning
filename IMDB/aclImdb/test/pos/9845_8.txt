this is a typically fastmoving entertaining movie of the early 1930s when you have james cagney in the lead these precode films are even better just fun stuff to watch usually when films are dated its a negative but not so with films from 19301934 yeah with the slang and the attitudes dress hairstyles etc they are dated but thats a big part of the fun these films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to viewbr br they also have a corniness which is appealing and fascinating you see people  like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this film and their goofy parents  that you just dont see in any period but this one early 30s early on this movie the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids one after the other yes we get the stereotypical emotional italian father the jewish dad the anglosaxon mom and a few other moms who all in dramatic form plead theirs is a good boy even though things are predictable in some cases you dont mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watchbr br this also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago too stealing robbing mugging lying  hey thats the human condition this movie debunks the theory that people were nicer back in the old days no people have always been rotten or good the degree was aided by their environment parents financial situation and other things here we get a bunch of dead end kids who wind up in reform schoolbr br the ridiculous and stupidlyliberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the reform school not punished in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire the explanation he was a meanie and deserved it so much for real justice and reform and patsy shooting a guy bit never having to even be questioned by police because hes the good guy notice the subtle antireligious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil warden thats no coincidence no accident that sort of negativeassociation things has been going on ever since the hays code was canned in the late 60s and was seen as you see hear in the precode early 30sbr br dudley digges by the way is outstanding in his bad guy role of mr thomson i especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarlyevil roles as an institution boss in a charles dickens film adaptation cagney played his normal role the takenoguff tough guy who gets the pretty girl dorothy griffith played by madge blake frankie darro also was effective as the leader of the boys jimmy smith just the looks on darros face alone made his character believable some thing he was the real star of the film but ill still go with cagney the rest of the reform school kids werent too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes but they were all fun to watchbr br i thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested those scenes are pure 1930s dead end kids stuff they always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like wally and beaver cleaver  hardly rough delinquents its very farfetched but it works entertainmentwisebr br overall a hokey but very entertaining movie typical of cagney films and those of the early 30s almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value
