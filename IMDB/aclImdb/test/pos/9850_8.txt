if you have not heard of this film it follows two sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in africa to america where they convince themselves they will find success and riches life is harder than expected in the states and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right the lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because theyre so perfect whether it be on the job at school or the time in between the two boys peter and santino are very honest with the filmmakers and make some very thoughtprovoking comments about life in the states its one of the only documentaries i can recall that when it ended i wanted it to go on for another two hours it might be difficult to find this movie cause it didnt get great distribution but check your local art house or independent theater and give this one a go side note if youre reading this when its already on video then definitely its worth a rent rating 2840
