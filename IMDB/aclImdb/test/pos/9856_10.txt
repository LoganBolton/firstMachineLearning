i loved this movie so worth the long running time i need help with the ending thoughbr br spoilerbr br the final shot of marie at the end  is this to suggest that she is still searching for renaud or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13 she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place i dont quite understand it but i know i really liked it so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it please elaborate on the endingbr br thanks
