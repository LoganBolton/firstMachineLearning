i think that pierre l√©aud or his character to be precise is really outlandish but with grace i also remember the chess player and of the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home something really curiousthe woman acting as the lawyer is to me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screenbut i must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriouslythe character who plays as the lead theater actor is really nice especially when hes annoyed by the new actor the one in purple tshirtalso the scene where the bearded actor  who belongs to another company  directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing as it often happens with this movie  for example when they drink tea they just make you want to have a cup
