after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks i had to put in my two cents this show was not despite what that goon in essex thinks the worst thing that ever aired on tv i think most of todays tv is much worse when is this stupid reality fad ever going to end and there isnt a current show i can stand to watch gimme the stuff i grew up with im a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit itbr br this show has been my alltime favorite for almost 30 years i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days i was such a misfit back then and fantasy island appealed to my imagination as i was a budding writer in those days it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft what a wonderful premise i wont say it didnt have its faults sometimes the scripts were pretty bad and some of the problems seemed trivial but it could be good too and it was a blast to watch and still is as for the cheesiness factor well i think its unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks btw most of the seasons aired in the 80s my favorite episodes came from seasons 2 3 and 4 mostlybr br to those who disparage herv√© villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature grow up and learn something its so easy to make fun when youre normal and perfect that man made the best of what he was dealt in life and if you dont like it thats just tough have a little compassion hes been dead 15 years and how easy it is to cut down someone who cant defend himself theres just no shame anymorebr br i love this show so it looks dated hate to tell you this but we didnt have splashy special effects and bluray discs we were lucky to have vcrs live with it accept it for what it is and thats just plain fun escapist tv describes it perfectly and thats what it was for me  an escape from my rotten real life and its still a lot of fun to watch
