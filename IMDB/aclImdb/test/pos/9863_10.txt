i must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off i got spanish judges on february i think it was mention it was the last copy but as i see it wasnt backordered but either way i have it i thought it was good i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew lillard im surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what a good actorbr br the story it about a con artist known as jack matthew lillard who claims to have merchandises called the spanish judges if you dont know what spanish judges are or havent seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read i wont even say what they are i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent donofrio and valeria golino as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece mark boone junior he has a girlfriend who wont even tell anyone her name because shes from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game a game that involves some lust lies and betrayalbr br there was some over acting in it matt and valeria as well as tamara were not one of them there were some scenes they couldve done better and the score couldve been a little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was a good song choice thats my opinion the fight scene in the end couldve been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con manbr br i know this is a review but i need to make a correction towards necro one of the reviewers valeria golino is not a newcomer according to this site she has been acting since 1983 to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie sheens italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good reviewbr br although i think its one of the rare films ive seen and its really good which is why i gave it 10 stars above i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw itbr br 810
