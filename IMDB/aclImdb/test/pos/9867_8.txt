i personally love this film amidst the halloween series ive found after watching it with many friends that you enjoy it completely or find it absolutely unbearable personally ive watched it dozens of times and it never gets old there is a great back story within the movie itself and a lot of different things are finally explained its a rather short movie at just shy of 90minutes but its definitely a thrill ridebr br the shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film but the acting is still there with the way he walks stalks and kills there are a lot of neat little screen shots with micheal appearing in the background which adds more of a spooky element to the movie
