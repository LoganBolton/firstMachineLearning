i bought this in the budget department last week i had halloween and halloween ii already and since i aim to collect every horror film ever i chose this after all the 1st two were goodbr br this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth it seems to create the correct atmosphere and has a nice history of michael myers it uses the old locations from the original and the main character is the kid whom laurie strode babysat that fateful halloween in 1978br br the climax also is fairly satisfying anyways it is a lot better than h20 which frankly is absolute crap
