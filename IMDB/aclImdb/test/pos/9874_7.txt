for some reason i always enjoy movies that people hate when i really dont think theyre that bad  and this is one of those films in the case of this movie i think it is way too overcriticized i really isnt that bad of a film at all in fact i think this is one of the better sequels halloween the curse of michael myers begins on the night before halloween where michael brutally murders jamie lloyd who was taken captive by the man in black in part 5 after she gives birth to his baby we are then introduced to the strode family who is now coincidentally living in the old myers house which seems to change in each film kara and her son danny are the main characters along with tommy doyle the now adult boy who survived the original killings they must fight together to save jamies baby from an evil cult that takes care of michael while michael himself is driven to kill by an old celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in haddonfieldbr br this is surely one of the best sequels in the series in my opinion anyway and i cant understand all of the hate it has gotten it had some nice suspense an interesting plot but sometimes confusing ill admit some scary moments here and there and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds not all of the acting wasnt particularly great but it was convincing enough for me marianne hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable paul rudd plays a grownup tommy doyle and is also very talented and plays his part nicely the rest of the supporting cast besides the brilliant donald pleasance isnt much to praise but it wasnt too bad either all things considered im still not sure if giving an explanation for why michael kills was completely necessary but it turned out to be okay in the end and i wasnt upset with the way they tied everything together the openended conclusion was also kind of eerie but could have been something more br br i have also seen the infamous producers cut of this film the original cut of it and i think that in some respects it is better it further explains the thorn curse that drives michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion it felt more natural than the conclusion that were given in the studio cut of the film i wish that dimension would release this alternate version of the film because i personally think it is better the chances of that are very slim thoughbr br overall halloween the curse of michael myers is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series this movie isnt the best of all horror movies but its definitely worth renting if you want to see michael do his thing just dont expect brilliance and youll enjoy it 710
