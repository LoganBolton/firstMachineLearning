in checking out peter falk plays an elderly new yorker who summons his children home so that they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide as the movie progresses we get to see everyones flaws and other problems while some people may interpret this as a heartwarming movie i mostly enjoyed it for peter falks character not letting anything get him down and even engaging in a little lewdness now and thenbr br so it might not be the best movie ever but still worth seeing ive long thought that peter falk has the perfect look to play this sort of role what with his glass eye and all also starring laura san giacomo david paymer judge reinhold and shera danese falks reallife wife
