cant grade this very well because i cant say i liked it but it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film the acting directing atmosphere music were all good its just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you cant truly relate to the movie ends it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings dont need to make any sense at all and still be strong but thats about itbr br the plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former exgirlfriend he is married brings his wife and later the kid while the ex knightley marries some other guy but the tension is there dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of ptsd add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands fullbr br bottom line you have to be in the mood to like this film the hard part is defining this mood i dont think ive ever been in it yet ever so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas
