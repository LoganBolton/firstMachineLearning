checking out is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be jewish judaism plays virtually no role in the film but american jewish culture  behavior gets thoroughly sent up it a loving way i wish the movie dealt with the religious perspective on the topics it explores because i think that would have been interesting br br ive never been a columbo fan so i wasnt familiar with peter falk  hes a lot of fun to watch its great to see judge reinhold laura san giacomo  david paymer again  why dont they work more theyre all hilarious the script is terrific with a lot of memorable oneliners ill be sure to use with my own family watch for gavin mcleod captain stubing as the doorman
