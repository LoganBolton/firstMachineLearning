of all the episodes of all series this one holds the closest to roddenberrys original tenet according to the book the making of star trek in roddenberrys writers guide to his story writers he states that any alien creature no matter how hideously ugly impossible to believe benign or malicious must hold some semblance of humanity that the tv viewing public can empathize with andor relate to devil in the darks horta which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung is a mother protecting her babies those ballshaped silicon nodules the miners keep finding throughout the mine passages and destroying because they have no idea what they are this is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that
