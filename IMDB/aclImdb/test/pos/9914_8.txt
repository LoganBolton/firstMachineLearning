i sympathized with the plight of the first man schmitter we see killed in this episode he reminded me of the trepidation associated with being a lone security guard at night somewhere  the type of work i did briefly about 20 years ago of course i was never in danger of being burned to a crisp as the colony chief lynch is fond of describing the monster in the dark here murdering members of a deep mining colony creates a scary impression in the first act we dont really see it in the early scenes and as many of us realize the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination big and shaggy is one voiced description but it actually turns out to resemble a big lumpy pepperoni pizza skittering along the ground like a silicon centipede  a limitation of the shows budget unfortunately this also shows in the latest matte painting famous to trek fans the only way to convey a long shot of the mining operationsbr br but the whole theme of this episode is about whats on the inside rather than outward appearances anyway sure this horta a newlydiscovered siliconbased lifeform looks like a mindless monster at first glance thanks to spocks telepathic ability probably the best use of a vulcan mind meld for plot purposes we learn its a highly intelligent even sophisticated creature besides spocks instrumental use of his talent mccoy gets to supersede his usual medical routine  healing a creature resembling rocks or asbestos he also gets to utter one of his most famous lines im a doctor not a bricklayer i found it very truetolife in his scene where he exults in his success though hes unable to get kirk to share in his enthusiasm  kirks too busy organizing results the episode throws unexpected turns in character  motivation at the audience as the story progresses spock champions the need to possibly preserve this discovered life as kirk takes his usual stand on preventing the deaths of any redshirts no half measures as in the man trap but later its kirk who for some reason holds back on firing a killing blast as if the heat of the hunt had worn off and hed had time to reflect on spocks point i believe it was during this episodes filming that shatner learned his father had died uncharacteristic for most of the first season this has a happy ending the conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism such as meeting standard quotas versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants  a space age version of protecting owls from the tractors of modern advancement somehow despite many killings and a sense that everything could go to hell at any moment with one raised phaser kirk and spock manage to broker an agreement which satisfies everyone i guess people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century
