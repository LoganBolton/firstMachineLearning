i rank opera as one of the better argento films plot holes and inconsistencies sure but i dont think they impair this film as much as many other reviewers seem to a lot of elements that are in many of argentos films are kinda offthewall but thats part of the draw of his filmsbr br short story psycho stalks the operas new leading lady the typical argento twists and turns ensue leading up to a decent payoff of a climax not argentos best but i still pull this one out from time to time definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff  just dont get this one mixed up with the abysmal phantom of the opera remake that argento did that one is truly awful 810
