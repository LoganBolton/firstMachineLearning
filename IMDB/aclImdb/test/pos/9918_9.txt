if you dont like italian horror you wont like this film on that notebr br overall it was a terrible experience many things happened vanessa redgrave was scheduled to be in the film and she pulled out one of the actors was crushed by a car i was engaged to be married but by the end of the picture that was finished my father died during the shooting all kinds of things dario argento on the making of operabr br i was truly impressed with argento and the film he made here especially against such harrowing circumstances the whole mystique of macbeth and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds untold volumes to operabr br throughout the film argento imploys some of his most clever and audience directed tricks a young opera singer christina is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders by taping several sharp blades to christinas eyelids the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes take a good look if you try to close your eyes youll tear them apart so youll just have to watch everythingbr br it is clear that argento put great care into constructing the faux macbeth opera onscreen and his hard work pays off add to this several unforgettably brutal murders an incredibly tense chase sequence and the genius use of pov to portray a certain character the role vanessa redgrave pulled out on thank god and youve got one of the best italian horror films ever createdbr br that said its still italian horror why christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyones comprehension some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach but personally i felt more tension towards christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the film the finale to tenebrae had my stomach churning more than anything in opera but thats probably just mebr br and the last five minutes argento wanted it he filmed it and hes fought to keep it in the film absolutely no one likes it myself included but its not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me it remains one of argentos best films to datebr br 910
