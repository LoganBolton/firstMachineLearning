opera opens with a very closeup shot of a birds everwatching eye and thus begins one of argentos most bizarre and enjoyable features my second favorite in fact behind deep red granted at times the movie is pretty absurd the lack of real concern after murders the bird attack the burnt dummy that endingÂ… but this is argentos fantastical world and once you come to terms with that youll find that it works i do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them for example the aforementioned bird attack is completely overthetop in theory yet look at the wonderful execution of it crows flying in chaos adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat the crowd in panic as seen through the circling birdseye view camerawork and then the focused attack aria of terror indeed argentos amazing flowing cinematography is on full display in opera and clearly one of the films highlights i also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music a nice contrast of music with each used effectively the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel the sound effects deserve a nod too stabs scissors beaks and allbr br inspector alan santini ive seen a lot of your movies yes youre really an expert in this field id be very interested to know your opinionbr br marco i think its unwise to use movies as a guide for reality dont you inspectorbr br inspector alan santini depends what you mean by realitybr br being that this is a giallo stylish murders are a must and dario does not disappoint the bullet through the door scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot if youll forgive the pun the blackgloved deepvoiced pulsating brained cool shots killer is cold and brutal and having him tape pins under our heroines eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch that all said as a giallo opera doesnt quite have as good of a mystery as it should the killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but theres little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders this and the strange ending couldve used more work despite these problems though opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror filmbr br one final note it was nice to see a movie for once show the correct view through binoculars just a circle not two circles together nice eye for detail dario
