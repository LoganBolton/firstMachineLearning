dario argento is a filmmaker im slowly getting into following the iconoclastic efforts of deep red and suspiria hes not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like plot that might be his one minor but for me apparent liability he wont let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences as his killers can go through any kind of elaborate setup of being invisible until revealing past the point of the pov tracking shots of said psychopathic killer but its thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a hitchcockian warp in fact as a note of interest if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an unfilmed hitchcock film which also took place in an opera argento had it beat by almost twenty years probably with no knowledge of the text its also unabashedly 80s cd players and heavy metal and the hair oh my and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallowbr br the story is simple an opera of macbeth is being produced with highstylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens theres even a talented upandcoming star replaced at the last minute betty played by marsillach but a murder occurs during the premiere interrupted not by that but by a falling light and now the killer is after betty she cant go to the police how can she let out that the opera is really cursed but will that matter in the face of a killer who wont let up one has probably seen premises like this played out in other argento films girl being chased by a killer but its how argento like de palma constructs and executes his sequences and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor the breakout of the ravens to attack the killer and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup a kind of overstylization ala leone the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1 and even sadomasochistic inspiration with the pins taped to bettys eyes more than once br br argento puts his actress through the wringer and shes all game for it even when things seem to just go into whatthehell territory i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl as if suddenly were in aliens now and through such dark genre material argento keeps the violence thick and fresh the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks and rightfully so during some scenes the way theyre shot and vibrate to a heartbeat it should be considered trash but its elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director this in spite of a silly ending sillier than anything that preceded what came before it thanks little lizard and an attempt to break the macbeth curse which unfortunately didnt seem to happen in real life on the set of opera 8510
