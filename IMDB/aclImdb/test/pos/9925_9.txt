i consider myself a casual fan of dario argento for every really good flick by him such as deep red and tenebre there seems to be one thats equally uninspired his output since opera has tended to disappoint still theres no denying that when hes at his best there are few horror directors who can top him i consider opera to be argentos finest workbr br this is definitely the film where all of his trademarks are present theres no welldeveloped characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to scrutinize it still think of argento as an european equivalent of brian depalma  the style is all that matters here so much it becomes the substance typical to argento theres some beautifully filmed murder sequences those unfamiliar with the mans work may perceive that as a sadistic remark and it may be considering the often time misogyny of them but its really true argento stages murder with an intricacy to eyepopping visual detail he truly makes graphic violence an art form plus his direction and the look of his films is impeccablebr br fortunately opera is one of his most frightening products argento is the only director whom i feel booming rock music works well for horror sequences when others attempt to pull it off it comes across as cheesy the acting varies with cristina marsillach playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animate young opera performer the rest of the actors are workmanlike and get the job done but again with argento the acting is never the point its the beautiful colors the terrifying violence and the overall fever dream  nightmare atmosphere 910
