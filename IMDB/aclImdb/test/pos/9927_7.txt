no matter how much it hurts me to say thisthe movie is not as good as it could have beenmaybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdbbut i expected so much morebr br surethe idea is a good onethe violent scenes and the camerawork are outstandingthe imagination of genius dario is breathtaking but the movie is soiled by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable first of all am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart with a different kind of music goblin during the needle scenesit would have been soooo intense insteadthe soundtrack destroys any chance for tension secondly the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired i dont want to say amateurish cause i love argentos moviesthe ending left me feeling emptytalk about a final impression this is hardly what happens in most of darios films thoughadmittedlysuspiria also suffers from a rushed finale even if most of it is brilliantbr br in shortwatch this movietry to make the most of its good pointsbut be prepared for some bad ones as well this is not a perfect movie by any means
