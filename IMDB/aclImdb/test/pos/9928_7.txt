betty is as an understudy in a production of verdis macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident however in the grand tradition of the scottish play the production seems cursed with problems not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew unfortunately for betty the killer seems to have special plans for her br br this is one of several mustsee argento madslasher flicks in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor i havent measured it but i reckon around twothirds of the shots in this film involve either pans dollies tracking or cranes  the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller the imagery is wild and dizzying  closeups of the heroines eyes forced open with nails a swooping glide around an opera house from a ravens point of view shots of the killers brain squirming a bullet fired through a peephole a swallowed chain dug out of a victims trachea conceptually its just amazing and could only be realised by this director the movie isnt without some shortcomings though the cast are variable at best  marsillach and barberini are both a bit shaky and his dubbing in the english version is appalling even by italian standards although argento regular nicolodi is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique the material is a nice threeway mix of the phantom of the opera shakespeare and slasher flick scripted by argento and his usual collaborator franco ferrini with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain whats actually going on full of all sorts of different music  brian eno claudio simonetti bill wyman puccini and of course verdi the scenes in the beautiful operahouse were shot at the teatro regio in parma for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera
