often considered argentos last great film this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it though i have yet to see mother of tears but to call it his last great film might be stretching it a bitbr br the directorial and stylistic flourishes  the hallmark of all argento films  is indeed present with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best the peephole sequence is especially memorable and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding the fluorescent lighting is beautifulbr br however the narrative  which is hit and miss in all of argentos films  is missing here there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences with one following the another leaving no real time to fully construct a right focused mystery to be solved all of this results in a climax that is well anticlimatic as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly carebr br regardless this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes i wouldnt recommend this as a starting point for argentos films however for that i would recommend either deep red or suspiria but if you enjoyed those or even any giallo then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire
