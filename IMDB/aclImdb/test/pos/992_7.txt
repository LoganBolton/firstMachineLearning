this is primarily about love in wwii yet we must remember that its also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his lifebr br the movies timing is just great it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times smiling and hoping youre not going to get bombed while it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to itbr br at one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors cillian murphy is on fine form here as is matthew rhys both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightleys characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by suggs of madness br br despite all of this its a rather slow movie coupled with the fact its just shy of two hours its quite a slog to get to the conclusionbr br overall its a solid nonfiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of wellknown british names behind the scenes but it really does drone on for too much at times still a worthwhile watch 710
