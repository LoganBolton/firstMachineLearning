horrorgenius dario argento is one of my personal favorite directors and his films suspiria phenomena and profondo rosso range high on my personal alltime favorite list opera of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no horror lover can afford to miss and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end this stunning and ultraviolent giallo could well be described as the masters nastiest film which is quite something considering that argentos films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence the violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a film censors nightmarebr br  warning spoilers ahead  br br just when betty christina marsillach a young opera singer is becoming successful a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her the murders are truly brutal and of particularly sadistic nature the killer attaches needles to the tied up bettys eyelids so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways when done with the butchering the killer releases betty and leaves just to come back for other friends of hersbr br as usual for argentos films the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized opera truly is a brutal film and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is this film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end the performances are entirely very good especially christina marsillach is brilliant in the lead a stunning beauty and great actress alike marsillach fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy other great performances include those of ian charleston as a horror film director who is directing an opera and director argentos reallife girlfriend daria nicolodi who has a role in many of his movies the camera work is excellent as in all argento films and the huge opera house is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the films beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere the score which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too even though i slightly missed goblins brilliant progressive rock soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other argento movies opera truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking giallo experience this is an absolute mustsee for any horror lover and i highly recommend it to any other filmfan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence excellent and absolutely tantalizing
