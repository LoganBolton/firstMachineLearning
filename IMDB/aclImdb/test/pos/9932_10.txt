being both a dario argento fan and a phantom of the opera fan i was dying to see his first take on the story before the sobaditsgood dario argentos phantom of the opera the film is just terrific even the plot which here is one of argentos best at a coherent story the way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific the film has a very nightmarish feel which helps on keeping you on the edge of your seat the colors have never been better in an argento film since the jawdropping suspiria the murders are clever and gory all done in argentos trademark style the thing with the eyes in this film is just unsettling and done some much better than in fulcis splatter the acting is soso but once you seen the movie more times you understand the characters motivations better and you get used to it my two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music i think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavymetal but its not executed very well here the ending is very disappointing which is the worst thing about the movie seeming to echo argentos previous phenomena but done terribly it just didnt need to end that way the same thing happened in the directors cut of the exorcist i wished they kept the original ending but still its a fantastic motion picture and really a mustsee if only for daria nicolodis memorable murder sequence
