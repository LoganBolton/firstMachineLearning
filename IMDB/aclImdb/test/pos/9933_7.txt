an opera diva has an accident which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role betty marsillach is now the star of mac beth but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out he gets his kicks out of tying betty up putting needles under her eyes so she cant close them and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyesbr br opera is certainly one of argentos more ambitious films like mixing it up with shakespheres macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdis version of macbeth but also argento just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune and like the ravens circling the castle dunsinane foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover but i dont want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth the similarities are far too subtle its just a typical argento masterstroke and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystiquebr br although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesnt fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strangebr br all in all opera is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good
