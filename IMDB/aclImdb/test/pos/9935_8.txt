even if its not labeled as a slasher flick it has all the elements the fact that slashers are well known for its low budget lame plot cheesy effects and everything you may add it doesnt means that there cant be good slasher movies opera fills the description even though its part of italian giallo which is far from being a slasher subgenrebr br dario argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror opera is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years though the movie takes place in a beautiful shinning place the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie br br i think of opera as a stylish slasher although theres in depth plot and character development the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful visually stunning gore tale the movies plot is simple as in every slasher theres a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actresssinger and forces her to watch gruesome deaths the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie the infamous peephole death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion its a terrific death scene that none other than argento could release the knife through the neck and mouth is another gruesome scene but less violent than the scissors death the gore in opera will please the wicked and lovers of violencebr br what i didnt like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic i mean after watching the first death the lead female calmed as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesnt makes much of a big deal about what she saw also shes left alone in home and doesnt take security measures still the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious for example when bettys friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens br br the direction of the movie is great for an italian giallo its excellent argentos creative pov shots are impressive the ravens also added a creepy feeling to the movie argento add his unique spice br br opera is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons in my opinion the peephole death scene brilliant the ravens attack in the end the opera setting the knife through the neck and mouth the heavy metal score combined with opera music this music never freaked me out before the killers ferocitybr br the only thing i dont like about opera is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes its ok to disturb the audience but i think that the opera music couldve added a creepier feeling still the shocking use of heavy metal is a singular disturbing aspect in the moviebr br watch opera even if you dont like gore theres a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person this is no suspiria but it deserves to be among argentos finest
