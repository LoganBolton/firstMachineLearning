opera the us title is terror at the opera is somewhat of a letdown after some of darios other movies like phenomena tenebre and suspiria i still cant find inferno anywhere its one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through its like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logicbr br the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes shell gouge out her eyes this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory argento fashionbr br unfortunately about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical this is especially directed towards the killers motivations i still havent completely figured out why hes such a nut the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sensebr br but for about the first hour or so this is some of darios best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking too bad it couldnt maintain it through to the endbr br rating7
