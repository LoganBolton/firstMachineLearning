i finally managed to get myself a copy of dario argentos opera and i tell you  that was about time  it was the last argento movie i had yet to see and im a fan of most of his work i reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint  like phenomena  but the plot idea of opera always appealed to me and it turns out i was right  i enjoyed every shot in opera and i was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last out of all the argento movies opera went straight to the number one spot and i hope i can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as wellbr br the script and plotidea of opera is rather simple especially compared to argentos previous movie phenomena that had too many ideas in it and ended up being a mess the plot of opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time its an excellent satiric comment  almost a spoof  towards the opponents of explicit violence spoilers a young opera singer  the gorgeous cristina marsillach  is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer during every massacre he commits he forces betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open there are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them theyre getting torn apart end spoilers to this simple  yet effective  idea argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens the classic piece  and curse  of macbeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value ancient masters like edgar allen poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them and dario argento knows it as well br br the violence and gore is very well presented in opera and thats what makes this a true argento picture his best in my opinion with profondo rosso as a close second i surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you especially for fans of the  italian  horror business this is an absolute must  favorite rewindscene  argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where bettys friend is getting shot in the eye while shes trying to see whos in front of the door
