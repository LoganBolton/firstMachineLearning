betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of verdis macbeth when a car mysteriously hits the lead betty is thrust into the spotlight opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the afterparty to celebrate in private with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown blackgloved masked figure the unknown assailant ties betty to a column gags her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament hes even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth and betty has been forced to watch all of this so begins bettys terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friendsbr br opera gets classified as a giallo but to me it differs in quite a few ways from the model less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argentos tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage the blackgloved masked killer may be omnipresent but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent instead opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable the focus is on the grisly death scenes bettys fear and the killers obsession with bettybr br opera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room youre sure that bettys had it but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck  the knife emerging in his mouth its a well shot and designed scene and those needles in the eyes  brilliant or take the death of the seamstress at first her death seems like an ordinary runofthemill murder but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killers locket what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girls throat open to get his chain finally theres the most famous death scene in opera that im amazed with each time i see it  mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento its got style to burn as implausible as it may be its creative memorable and a blast to watchbr br argento certainly wasnt the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation but in opera hes taken eye trauma to a new level needles holding eyes open a bullet in the eye and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argentos vision pun intended and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in bettys eyes i couldnt stop blinking it actually had a physical effect on me what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films br br to be fair and not sound like such a fanboy there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argentos best one of my problems is with the air duct system running through bettys apartment building while i dont doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the ducts in opera are huge im no expert but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts it doesnt seem practical at all and dont you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments its convenient for the plot but its not very realisticbr br but i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale whats up with that ending it feels totally out of place tacked on and like a bad afterthought im not sure what else to say other than its horrible
