ive noticed that a lot of people are taking opera to task for the way betty reacts to the murders i think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a normal person would react the thing isbetty is not a normal person due to traumatic events in her childhood she has problems way way before the movie ever even startsand by the end of operain my opinionshe has become totally unhingedbr br spoilers you have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mothers lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching itbr br she was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked slashed and strangled to death that does not make for a healthy home life i think its pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her it is also likely that at her impressionable age betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw is this just something that adults do etcbr br betty obviously looks up to her motheri meanshes become an opera singer just like her if mommy likes it it cant be bad can itmommy cant be bad can she she couldnt tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommybr br betty has a lot of deepseated emotional issues her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doingbut it keeps coming to the surface manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares skullthrobbing migraines a dependence on relaxation techniques and sexual frigidity she associates brutal violencebloody death with sex on a subconscious level theres an inner struggle between the part of betty that has confused murdersex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrongbr br after shes seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded manshe calls the police yet is unwilling to give her name the part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call but the part that is ambivalent wont allow her to admit personal involvement the ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way so she walks away from the phone in the rainand when shes picked up by the director shes acting surprisingly calm not as upset as you would think a normal person would bebecause the part of her thats been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what shes just witnessedbr br the state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within bettys psyche her singing career is starting to bear fruitshes going to be a great opera singer like her mother was but is she going to become like her mother in all ways in the darker ways or will she be able to make her own path add this to the reemergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around herbr br its not until the hooded man kills daria nicolodis character that betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer heres someone who loves betty whos supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career who is in fact a maternal figure in bettys life now since mommys dead imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeballbr br i could go onbut i wont the main gist of what im saying is that the character of betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledgebr br opera is one of argentos bestand not just for the visuals alone although they are truly magnificent and not just for the inventive murders although they are there is a depth hereand attention needs to be paid
