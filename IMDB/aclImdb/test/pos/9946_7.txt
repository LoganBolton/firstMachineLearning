four or five episodes of johnnie socko and his flying robot edited together amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed squarely at kids parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robotmonster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff youd find in the al capone st valentines day school and gangster training academy i liked it but then again i grew up on the series if there is any problems other than the men in suits effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes stitched together with a climax coming every 20 minutes recommended for those whove run out of ultraman or godzilla
