if you love japanese monster movies youll love this action packed battle pitting an alien invader intent upon conquering the earth and a giant robot with an armory of super weaponry the alien emporer guillotine from the planet gargoyle has a army of thugs called of course the gargoyle gang as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely loosed upon the earth to smash buildings make loud noises panic the populace etc a little kid named johnny sokko has the giant robot at his beckon call and sends the robot as needed to beat up and then blast these creatures johnny joins a group of good spies called unicorn and endeavors to help save the worldbr br in spite of the campy nature unintentionally humorous dialog and the fact that the target audience was obviously children this movie has nonstop action colorful characters decent special effects and just happens to be downright fun to watch battle scenes are well executed and frequent as the storyline requires the good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs lasers ammunition and schemes to attack each other in spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a tv series the plot actually develops and reaches an ultimate conclusionbr br the film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyones especially kids desire to destroy evil in its many forms kids may be the target audience but its fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness yet at the same time root for the good guys to prevail and save the world the acting is cheesy in places but that is the charm there are several lines of corny dialog possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers and youll find yourself quoting these absurd lines laterbr br admittedly this film is not high in production quality or budget however for what it is campy scifi its enjoyable for some laughs i recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing
