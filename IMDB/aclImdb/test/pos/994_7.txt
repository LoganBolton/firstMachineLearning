this film flopped miserably in the uk and it didnt deserve to the trailer of this film is slightly misleading and i guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was atonement part 2 while the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of joe wrights baftawinning film its very different in tone it focuses on an imagination of sorts of welsh poet dylan thomas life during the second world war as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to wales director john maybury quickly introduces dylans matthew ryhs childhood sweetheart vera phillips played by keira knightley she was dylans first love in their homeland but the moment has passed and singer vera only wants it as a beautiful memory or does she vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in dylans life queen of ireland love of my life mother of my child caitlin thomas sienna miller the three form a sort of menage a trois in warstruck london but vera then falls for a dashing soldier william killick cillian murphy they quickly marry with killick leaving for war a frightened vera convinces the thomas to return witb her to wales but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of veras child williams jealousy and shellshock after returning home and caitlin realising she cannot share dylan with her best friendbr br filmed on a low budget this is more of a mood piece than anything else it works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed the performance of sienna miller is particularly excrellent unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats shes quite a talent and knightley and murphy are once again very good the letdown is rhys as dylan who while the welsh poet himself was no bed of roses lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in dylan the writing is very choppy some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness its certainly worth watching however
