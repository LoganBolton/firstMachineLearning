william shakespeares merchant of venice portrays 16th century venice al pacino plays shylock a jewish loan shark who plots revenge on a catholic that has looked down on him the movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours the film gives a very good and believe appearance to its characters especially pacino when hearing that pacino plays a jew one might think that it would not work looking at pacinos previous mobster type movie roles nonetheless it works very well credit must be given to the costume designers and directors of the film the look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in the costumes look like the renaissance appearance one might envision to bebr br the film portrays a very antisemitic vibe from the first minute to the last it is shown how the catholics try to take advantage of the jews in every way they can even to the point of keeping them locked away in ghettos and not allowing them to regular jobs in comparison to the passion of the christ another recent film that people believed to be very antisemitic merchant of venice makes passion look like a jewish holiday the film shows how the jews or at least shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the jews received the location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film making it just that much more realistic showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as antisemitic because the ugly is usually shown around the jews and the beautiful around the catholicsbr br although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act the oh so serious trial between shylock and antonio irons adds a bit of humor when portia collins and nerissa goldenhersh come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated that in itself might not be funny but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing the whole cross dressing scene as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director michael radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized the director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men which in part takes away from the scene but doesnt kill it entirelybr br overall the film gets a 7 out of 10
