one of my favorite lines in shakespearebr br ie were not finished with you by a long shot so not only does shylock not get his pound of flesh or the 3000 or the 6000 or the 36000 each of the 6 parts were a ducat ducats in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to forfeit all his possessions and his daughter has long abandoned him alreadybr br vengeance is a dish best served cold but shylocks attempt at revenge totally backfires br br i suspect this play was and is popular because it caters to the wish we have for justice but the hard reality is the world is engulfed in injustice and most of it stands a few big names get tossed in jail sme gang punks lose their turf to the good guys but in reality most of the time its the other way aroundbr br but not in this play the long howls of racism and antisemitism forgets that it could well have been any other social outcast group that gets the comeuppance its just that the money lenders of the time were jews and therefore the needs of the story line puts shylock the jew into the role of villainbr br merchant of venice is my 3rd favorite work by shakespeare 1 and 2 being hamlet and macbeth this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story the scenes with the suitors alone is worth watching also the awkwardness of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact they let the rings so easily slip away that they had sworn to keep forever in real life this trick is the thing that spouses coyly use to remind their better half that promises must mean something and not be made frivolously there is far deeper significance to this play than just the comedydramatic aspect it is about loyalty commitment and lovebr br well worth watching over and over
