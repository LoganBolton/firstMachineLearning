there were at least a half dozen silentfilm versions of shakespeares the merchant of venice and there have been several television productions but no one has ever gotten around to making a bigbudget theatrical feature from the play    until now given the nature of the plays most memorable character shylock the nasty jew its a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in europe in the late 1930s and 1940s may have dampened filmmakers enthusiasm sure the main motivation for michael radfords new film is to provide al pacino with a chance to shout bray brood mutter and be tormented  all of which he is quite good at like richard iii the role of shylock is a scenerychewers dream it is ridiculous to call shakespeare an antisemite since he never met a jew jews were banned from england from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad on some level jews might as well have been a mythological race to him but while shakespeare may not have been antisemitic his play certainly is pacino gives shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of yiddish unfortunately the result is a 16thcentury moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of fozzie bear radfords version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of jews and then spot antonio jeremy irons gratuitiously spitting on shylock pacino whos really just standing around minding his own business will buy it when it comes out on dvd for sure sarge booker
