keira knightley and sienna miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas knightley is thomass boyhood sweetheart he reencounters during the blitz meeting at a bar they reconnect however things become complicated when thomas brings his wife miller along the next time he meets her the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become knightlys husband this further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its facebr br beautiful to look at extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted everyone disappears completely into their roles this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears its so nice to see a film about adults being adults on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully craftedbr br the trouble with the film is im not entirely sure of everything that happened something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something its not bad but its not completely satisfying as a result i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldnt find anything still i think this is a film worth seeing its a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done
