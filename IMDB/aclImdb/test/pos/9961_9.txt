the merchant of venice is a fantastic movie its very true to the original shakespeare play if you saw jeremy irons in casanova and liked his performance this is a movie for you if you saw joseph fiennes in shakespeare in love and you enjoyed his performance this is a movie for you if you saw al pacino in donnie brasco and liked his performance this is a movie for you it is a very enjoyable movie and if youre studying shakespeare like me this is a great movie to see the only problem with this movie is that you cant let the little ones see it because is has a wee bit of nudity in it but other than that its a really good movie
