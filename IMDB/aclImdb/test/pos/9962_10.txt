my guide for the quality of the a movie is if im still thinking about it after leaving the theater im still thinking about this one the next day which doesnt happen oftenbr br the scenery a reasonable guess for 16th century italy costumes lighting cinematography are all excellent it is a beautiful film visuallybr br characters can never rise above the script they must recite but these actors made the most of their material which is excellent this is one of shakespeares best plays which people will still enjoy another 400 years down the road all of the principals were interesting and enjoyablebr br those who say this is antisemitic must be deaf and blind if anything it is antivenitian16thcenturycatholic while shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the hurts he has suffered it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame the script clearly places his personal responsibility where it belongs as wellbr br a great film
