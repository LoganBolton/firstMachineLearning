william shakespeares the merchant of venice is about a jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant antonio the forfeiter of a debt the jewish moneylender of course is shylock and he is given such a towering performance by al pacino that even outstanding actors like jeremy irons joseph fiennes and lynne collins fade into the background the film is set in 16th century venice and director michael radford relies on setting mood and realism to tell its story rejecting lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audiencebr br radford slices the plays threehour length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background in the opening narration he tells us how jews came to england were subject to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from england they were forbidden to own property could make profits only by lending money at interest and were forced to live in a venetian geto a forerunner of darker events to come in the film the merchant antonio jeremy irons spits upon shylock in public yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover bassanio joseph fiennes to properly court portia lynne collins a wealthy heiress though shylock has been insulted by antonio he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grants him the right to exact a pound of flesh from antonios heartbr br the play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge but like many of shakespeares works there are touches of broad comedy as well here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers bassanio and portia gratiano bassanios friend and nerissa and lorenzo another friend of bassanio and jessica shylocks daughter portia has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold silver and lead the prince of morocco chooses the one of gold the prince of aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed bassanio however loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within radfords adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place portias residence at belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of shylocks city with its dank alleywaysbr br when it becomes clear that antonio cannot repay the debt bassanio returns to venice leaving portia behind when he arrives the loan is in default and shylock is demanding his pound of flesh even when bassanio backed by portias wealth offers many times the amount in repayment shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status the duke who sits in judgment will not intervene as portia enters in the guise as a lawyer to defend antonio it is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolutionbr br the merchant of venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of jews from christian society and their desire for belonging it has been one of shakespeares most controversial plays and analysts have debated for a long time whether it is an antisemitic play or simply a play about antisemitism that reflects the prevalent view of christian society in elizabethan england although shylock is definitely a caricature he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that shakespeare views his flaws as human failings not jewish ones the duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the torahbr br in the monologue i am a jew hath not a jew eyes if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not revenge shylock shows a universal humanity expressing the equality of all men though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out we can feel his pain accumulated over the years pacinos performance brings new vigor to the text and his often overthetop persona is replaced with a gentler more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause during a toronto international film festival interview last september radford said about pacino when you work with a brilliant actor you have a great machine its a bit like driving a powerful car you have to dare to do it he has dared and we are all the beneficiaries
