it is a risky business to film such a lavish production of the merchant of venice it could be a stodgy wooden period piece or it could be laughable for its excesses this version is neither while i am not completely sold by al pancinos very restrained shylock he does give a competent and honorable performance jeremy irons antonio is as always with his torturedself roles riveting some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of boisterous fun a boys own venician adventure story but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically moved forward through the filmbr br it goes without saying that the location shots costumes and interiors were breathtaking almost to the point of distractionbr br one thing on which i do not wish to comment on is the antisemetic content of the play the film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the jews as possible while still portraying shylock as the instrument of his own selfdestruction it is a sad comment that four centuries later the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film festbr br this is a beautiful film and i look forward to several viewings
