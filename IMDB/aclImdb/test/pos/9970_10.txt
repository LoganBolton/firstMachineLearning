i am always impressed when a director and this case directorscreenwriter takes a piece of classical text  and makes it come alive sure shakespeares text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with selfimportance but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so  by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply aweinspiring there are many troubling things about the play it is a racist play about racism  and that still sticks i have never accepted jessicas desertion of her father without any acceptable reason i have never accepted the christians position of sanctimonious selfrighteousness but brilliantly there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set and mercifully much of jessicas part is cutbr br the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut but i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it  and it was replaced by a look that said it all this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie  not just a film of the playbr br and at last there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeservingunrelated bassanio  you can almost feel antonios pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of bassanio passing by in a gondola or arriving for a visit but it is as subtle as that  no more i was spellboundbr br there were many other highlights i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking and the suitors trials are hilariousbr br add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times and youll understand why i cant wait to see it again and again
