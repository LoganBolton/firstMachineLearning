this movie has a decent story in my opinionvery good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the moviei think that it was a way better if lydie denier knew karate also or if she knew to use some weaponsher character has become more interesting too and she was a decent opponent to cynthiai think when the director filmed the final battle between cynthiadenier he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didnt care how the end was going to beall in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movieits not like yesmadam or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 810
