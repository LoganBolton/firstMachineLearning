rainy day with not much to do we were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting so we gave it a chancebr br the more we watched the more we became engrossed in the story its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time 1913 i think was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as seabiscuit and this is also based on a true storybr br the acting is believable and the casting is brilliant and     we are not golfers so please dont miss this one just because its about golf any individual sport would serve the plot because its about the people golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the gamebr br bottom line     its a feel good movie its well put together and isnt it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two
