at 20 years old francis ouimet shia lebouf as his whole life ahead of him  in a way the son of an immigrant family living in the late19th to early20th centuryera united states class was a very limiting fact of life if one is born poor one stays poor if one is born into the bourgeoisie one has a tiny bit of opportunity if one is born into the wealthy class they essentially have it made in the shade british gold champion harry vardon and francis golf idol played by the criminally underrated stephen dillane is the exception that proves the rule born and raised in a poor british family his accomplished skill at golf allowed him to rise from the dirty mess of the poorest slums to the lush greens of the english country clubs he has not forgotten this life lesson francis wishes to follow in vardons footsteps and similarly uses his great skill at golf to get into the 1913 us open at age 20 but a tough course and formidable opponents including francis idol harry vardon are not all that francis must deal with as a lessthanunderstanding father and cruel societal framework stand in his way of living his own dreambr br i know what you are thinking  i thought it too  a walt disney produced film about the 1913 us open starring the irritable shia labeouf holds the possibility of being entertaining but it cannot possibly be a great film well i am here to encourage you to think again despite what it may look to some on paper the greatest game ever played is one of the best sport films in creationbr br as with every great sport film the greatest game ever played includes many exciting sport scenes but it is not a film about golf  it is a character centered film about using ones talents following ones dreams and breaking out of class barriers where the greatest game ever played works excellently as a themed sport film it also works just as well as a period film  the films featured costumes and sets being the next best thing to actual time travel the film also simply looks great and virtually unknown music composer brian tyler set the film to a wonderful piece of music the cast is great as well with a subtle but powerful stephen dillane as british golfing champion harry vardon a hilarious stephen marcus as mans man golfer ted ray a hammy josh flitter as francis preteenaged caddy eddie and a surprisingly good shia labeouf in the lead role as francis actor bill paxton apollo 13 titanic turns director here for the second time directing a fulllength feature in the greatest game ever played he produces a fine product  incorporating plenty of heart ingenuity and an attention to detail in the making of the film
