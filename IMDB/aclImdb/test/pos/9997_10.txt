wow here is another great golf movie thats at least three in the past few years that ive really enjoyed that were welldone beautifullyfilmed and inspirational the other two were bobby jones stroke of genius and the legend of bagger vancebr br this is a true underdog story if there ever was one to have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the united states open golf tournament is an unheardof feat i believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished how much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect i dont know i do know that i plan on reading the book and i know that in reallife francis ouimet had a threestroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go unlike what we saw in the filmbr br whatever francis ouimets victory over golf legends harry vardon and ted ray is fact it is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here it isnt something just for golf fans this is a fun movie kudso to actorturneddirector bill paxton for an outstanding jobbr br yes a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as ouimets relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him its also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance the movie also deals with vardons demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitists sport which it was at the time for both europeans and americansbr br shia labeouf is winsome as ouimet as is steven dillane as vardon for those who dont know vardon was like the tiger woods of his day maybe even more unbeatable in the film vardon is pictured as a warm nice guy a genuine human being the other major competitor ray stephen marcus is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy br br the fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film a fifthgrade boy who winds up being ouimets caddie in the open he josh flitter brings a lot of humor and charm to the moviebr br if all of this  a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole  were not true you would think oh man this is so hokey who could believe this thats what makes this truelife story fun to see finally captured on film as with another sports film of 2005  cinderella man  here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards i guess nice films dont win awardsjust the hearts of their viewers
