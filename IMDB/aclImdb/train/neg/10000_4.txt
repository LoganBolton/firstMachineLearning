airport 77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them  a bunch of vips to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen quinlan  her son the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but midair the plane is hijacked by the copilot chambers robert foxworth  his two accomplices banker monte markham  wilson michael pataki who knock the passengers  crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo  land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean  loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in  having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivors as they await help with time fast running outbr br also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smashhit disaster thriller airport 1970 was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like its predecessors i cant say airport 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice midair hijacking  then the crashing didnt he see the oil rig  sinking of the 747 maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure 1972  submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened  its a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic characters dull dialogue lethargic setpieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  theres not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things dont pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but theres just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the backgroundbr br the home video  theatrical version of airport 77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out characters longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport 77 as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects arent great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie awards hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon thats a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properlybr br the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isnt great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for toobr br airport 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production  bland direction doesnt help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldnt be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde  airport 79 1979
