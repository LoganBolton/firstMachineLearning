it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and lets not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allens bergman pretensions allens whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i dont get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspensehorror films in robin woods view its a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that
