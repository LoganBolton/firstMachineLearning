the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a swedish film  the first being susan sontags brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers im afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i dont like who im becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly selfinvolved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in  i dont know  the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allens earlier films  only hes directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebritybr br the basic plot  dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother  seems to be lifted more or less from bergmans winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etcbr br allens later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining ill take interiors woodys rarely made a funnier movie
