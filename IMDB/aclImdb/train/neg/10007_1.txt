this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anticomedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denises marriage hopefully that effort produces better results
