the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i dont think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70s the subject was just not believable for the year 2007 even being set in dc i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most didnt stay for the qa eitherbr br i dont think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didnt know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really didnt get woodys carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq prisons about what was he thinking i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woodys character car it didnt work it didnt even seem to make sense reallybr br the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson he played his character car flawlessly you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it br br as for lauren lily and kristin boringbr br dont see it it is painful unless you are a true harrelson fan
