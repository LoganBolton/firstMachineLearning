the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning  one at the end together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i dont get troubled by gritty scenes  but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazydark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesnt get naked not even in the nc17 version which i sawbr br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead  youll probably have more interesting dreams
