ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many 50s movies about hotrodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens cant pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and theres a twist at the endbr br theres nothing in this movie that you havent seen in other movies but its nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foulmouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didnt talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we dont expect out of a bird the movies pure hokum but harmless
