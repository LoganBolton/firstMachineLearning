i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments its not a bad movie exactly but its one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters behavior often strains belief id say its a film that you would get something out of if you dont have a lot of filmtvliteraturelife behind you to be honest ive seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even otherwise its point has been made before and more artfully and that gets to the big problem which is that it really doesnt have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it doesnt really pay off
