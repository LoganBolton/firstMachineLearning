the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbsup advertisements stitched together heavily influenced from the matrix and kungfu hustle but very poorly executedbr br i did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder what were these guys thinkingbr br the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikinibr br the reason why i did not give a rating of 1 is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong
