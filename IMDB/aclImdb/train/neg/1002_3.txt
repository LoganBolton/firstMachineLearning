i dont want to go too far into detail because i cant really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between boringpointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes  ghost in the shell fans this is not an action scifi or anything like that  its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything  i wasnt expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didnt achieve this yaaawwnnn rent kinos journey instead
