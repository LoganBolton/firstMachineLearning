sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attackbr br such amazing 3 songs in promo  dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight lossbr br musicwise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they havent thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album  if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandeybr br overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad englishbr br go away man i need to puke
