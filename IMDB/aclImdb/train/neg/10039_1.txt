this movie is horrible the acting is a waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though the scenery is great i have always wanted to go to greecebr br anyway as for saif youd expect a great performance but even he let down the peoplebr br akshay kumar recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs he was sensational in this movie for only this performance filmfare should introduce another award the toiletries award for the worst performance by the way the trophy should be a toilet seatbr br kareena kapoor she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma in acting in looks or in body she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her she comes into this movie wearing bikinis and tank tops and short shorts i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wifetobe dress like that but she mustve impressed some people dressing like that and if you ask how then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom including me personally i think that she dressed like a whore but i really liked itbr br i am forced to give it a 110 but id really give this movie a 010 an unachieved film
