the sight of kareena kapoor in a twopiece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan Â— the megadisappointing mindnumbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film its a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because theyve got big movie stars onboardwritten and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what youd describe as a road movie but one thats going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a callcentre executive whos hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji  thats anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmys got his eye on pooja the gangsters pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangsters faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money thats hidden across the length and breadth of the countrymuch like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatments so overthetop so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional threeact structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bulletdodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeenas bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhannostyle horsedriven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because youre just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fastpaced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweetheartsyou see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making whats more i dont think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stewthere are films that kill you softly and then theres tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossyfinish camerawork exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesnt hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesnt help either because they dont blend with the films waferthin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoors grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of overthetop delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent its thanks to akshay kumars irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when hes cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those doublemeaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when hes up theredespite some good music from vishalshekhar the songs seem like theyre only prolonging your misery well thats because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didnt know tashan means style im sorry to say this film has none
