such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out  out comedya bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i dont think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there br br action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head  tail of the stunts theyve used akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done much much betterbr br animation is the worst ive seen in recent movies90s movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lakebr br and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess
