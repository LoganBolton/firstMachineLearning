masters of horror the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god scientist alan jasn priestley is brought in by the government  knows more than most  senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne kerry norton to take their teenage daughter amy brenna obrien  try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on thembr br this canadian american coproduction was episode 7 from season 2 of the masters of horrror tv series directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks it takes itself far too seriously  i dont really understand why its part of the masters of horror series the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself  themes  ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever its gets the chance during its short 60 odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up i wasnt happy with the inconsistencies with the story either if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that womans neck on the plane was he sexually aroused i think not why does every bloke then think hes killing in the name of god i just cant see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible  starting to believe in god i just found the notion ridiculous  the show also states clearly that theres nothing religious about whats going on so whats the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see then theres the fact people get turned on by different things what about gays for instance will they kill guys instead of women i know theres a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but its conveniently brushed to one side  then theres the thing which annoyed me the most the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho  killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened it just felt so stupid the plotting is rubbish  to round things off theres a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the xfiles 1993  2002 with a bright neon alienbr br director dante on this showing definitely doesnt qualify as a master of horror as far a im concerned the story is badly paced its just so stupid considering its played deadly straight  instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with its deadly virus on the loose situation  the subsequent mother  daughter on the run because of it theres very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror  even less gore theres a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle  another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home aboutbr br technically like the other episodes its really good  it doesnt have the look of a cheap tv series the special effects are great as usual  its well made the acting is alright but noone really stood outbr br the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode ive seen but bear in mind i havent seen all of them yet as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me  as a show made by a socalled master of horror it disappoints me even more
