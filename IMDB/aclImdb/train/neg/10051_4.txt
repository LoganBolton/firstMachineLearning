i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned from the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fictionbr br its bleak depressing and hopeless while i dont mind a less than cheery ending im really very tired of the humans suck clich√© thats central to every movie i know you cant get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of selfhatred as a member of the human race but hows bout as a writerdirector we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim til your arms are tired this way you wont be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive its silly not thoughtful and boring
