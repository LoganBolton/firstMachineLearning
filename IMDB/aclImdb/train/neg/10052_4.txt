warner bros made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced economical and very entertaining i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life this is one of warners few hardedged melodramas that simply doesnt work edward g robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that dont cut the mustard hb warner aline macmahon and boris karloff are good but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie in addition the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of precode hollywood leroys direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations sol politos camera work is strong somehow this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture in a year that gave us m dracula and frankenstein
