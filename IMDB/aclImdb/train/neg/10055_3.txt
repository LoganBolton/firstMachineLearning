i grew up on the superman ii theatrical version s2t and as a kid i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three supermantype villains it started off with a bang  the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen as in part i now as an adult i can see how the mighty had fallen with s2t see my review ive always heard of the backstory on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the originals director richard donner from part ii it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now its common back to the future and matrix 2  3 for example unfortunately after finally seeing the richard donner cut or s2rd i still cant fully recommend it gone was the great superman change scene the entire paris rescue as was the wonderful recap of part i in s2ts opening in fact they all but wrote the words previously on superman in s2rd the special effects werent great in either part i or s2t  but s2rd they were mostly downright laughable  such as lois falling from the daily planet window i will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures such as any scene in the honeymoon suite overall if you grew up on s2t as i did and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as i do as an adult you should absolutely see s2rd as its almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes spoiler alert unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s2t replaced with the exact same ending as i this is not only a lazy unoriginal copout it doesnt make sense on why clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened and will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation
