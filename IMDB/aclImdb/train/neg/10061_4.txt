the curse of frankenstein sticks faithfully to mary shelleys story for one word of the title which wouldnt be so bad if the changes were any good at all the tragedy of the creature destroying frankensteins family has been completely excised and replaced with nothing the heart and moral centre of the story is gone it doesnt help that this frankenstein is a conniving devious murderer he deserves everything he gets the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clich√©s even taken on its own terms this is rubbish a bland rambling film featuring a shitelooking creature with a pudding bowl haircut as its the first of hammers horror films directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee its place in horror history is secure but its crap
