im sorry but even tj hookers adrian zmed couldnt save this sequel i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie being shamed by that putz character carrington id hate to see what they would resort to later maybe mopedsbr br i also never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook it was disney story gone horribly awrybr br so it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubblegum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
