well at least my theater group did lol so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl while it was never my favorite musical or story it does still hold a little special place in my heart since its still a lot of fun to watch i heard horrible things about grease 2 and thats why i decided to never watch it but my boyfriend said that it really wasnt all that bad and my friend agreed so i decided to give it a shot but i called them up and just laughed first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasnt really clever not to mention they just used the same characters but with different names and actors tell me how did the pink ladies and tbirds continue years on after the former gangs left not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy gee what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these tbirds were just stupid and ridiculousbr br another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasnt stopped but when a new student who is sandys cousin comes into the scene he is love struck by a pink lady stephanie but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the tbirds so the new student decides to train as a tbird to win her heart so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the tbirds butts but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own well find out for yourselfbr br grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didnt work the gang didnt click as well as the first grease did not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable because i thought that she graduated from rydell but apparently she didnt the songs were not really that catchy im glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast but thats probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel i wouldnt really recommend this film other than if you are curious but i warned you this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musicalbr br 210
