when i was 11 grease 2 was like crack it was a classless shameful euphoric and powerfully addictive experience my sister and i would watch it rewind it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another so if you are an 11year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original grease you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will passbr br if however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease 2 was anything but an inane artless slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production distribution andor consumptionbr br for the sake of criticism i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blowsÂ… br br 1 in a wellexecuted musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters in grease 2 with a few debatable exceptions to the music is obscenely pointless most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way score tonight reproduction do it for our country and prowlin without making one concrete statement about any of the films characters or themes plus all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dancebr br 2 the tbirds should be badass and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying wussydufusloser in the end when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred tbird jacket and initiates him into the gang michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it but of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads there is no greater honor than to be one with the tbirds br br 3 since michael is beautiful smart kind resourceful and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask stephanie on the other hand is a slovenly slackjawed bubble gum smacking dirty sweatshirt wearing gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat so aside from being pretty i guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michaels attraction to herbr br i could go on and on but i didnt want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair i will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old times sake grease 2 is an experience akin to reliving your first kiss only you are 32 now and kissing a snotnosed 13year old kid with acne and slobby braces the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed trust me
