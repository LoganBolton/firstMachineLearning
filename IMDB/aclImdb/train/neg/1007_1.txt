i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film i managed to stomach 4550 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead which by the way is great funbr br the story has massive holes in it the plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet freeman and timberlakes characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of fatherson relationship of sorts or something which simply isnt evident at all apart from the fact that though freemans character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover upbr br it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportionbr br dont watch this film it is a pure waste of time
