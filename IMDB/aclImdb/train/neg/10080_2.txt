i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love its not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime everythings pretty restrained and you dont really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer i wasnt able to become emotionally invested in the storyline i guess im not the target audience for this but im not sure who is everythings muted and soft focus and earth tonesnothings very interesting i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but its handled so discreetly that i was disappointed rent personal best instead
