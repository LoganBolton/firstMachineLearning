ive read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing its so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in clicheridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it doesnt because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull its as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasnt allowed by studio execs to give the story some truetolife gusto or didnt have the cojones this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standardissue bad lifetime tv movie
