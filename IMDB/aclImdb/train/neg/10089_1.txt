german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible hes unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever madebr br lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the bestworst of ew i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried itbr br the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight facebr br the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the lapd refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartmentbr br the sets are excruciatingly bad the production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint precinct 707 on a cardboard wallbr br since the actors were obviously unpaid nonprofessionalsa sad assortment of european emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands bimbos mimbos and desperate middleaged womenand since little if any money was spent on sets special efx locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuinelooking police uniforms sadly they couldnt afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rentalbr br more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him one of these young actors is especially pitiable because hes the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciatedbr br the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her dont ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered just accept lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ridebr br after much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even prettier with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the runwaybr br at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll and injects large doses of cheesy eurotrash techno into the soundtrack were talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his bootybr br unlike other zombies lommels girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming zombified this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it isbr br i wont spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is its perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his geist
