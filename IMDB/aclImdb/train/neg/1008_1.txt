the plot of edison was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire frat squad br br whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it br br do not waste your time watching this film dont even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better choicebr br and justin if youre reading this stick to music even though youre no good at that youve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing
