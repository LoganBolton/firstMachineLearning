seriously crappy moviebr br first off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouses attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesnt think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for nowbr br the bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffelbagged bodybr br since she had the oogeyboogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eyeshadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eyeshadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others dont even notice massive plot holebr br so to wrap it up the eyeshadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping
