i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art dont be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i dont know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed  br br the description on the back of the box doesnt even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then ive lost all faith in humanitybr br and dont even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations or that the cops didnt even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on br br this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans
