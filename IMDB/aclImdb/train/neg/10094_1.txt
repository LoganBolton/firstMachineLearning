mt little sister and i are selfproclaimed horror movie buffs we have seen just about everything especially zombie flicks now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever zombie makeup was the worst i have seen if you can even call it makeup  black eye shadow around the eyes this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by its cover cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying this movie sucks dont waste your time return now hahahhaa i dont want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie i dont even know how it got the ratings that it did t should be in the negative
