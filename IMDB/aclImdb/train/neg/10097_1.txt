i stopped by bb and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend now i understand that the effects will be cheesy the acting will be subpar and the sets will be suspect so im not expecting much but it should at least have a story stories dont cost a thing except timeapparently they didnt have any time eitherbr br zombie nation had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genrebr br the running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours according to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room it sounded like zombie pornwhich if you think about sounds kinda grossbut it wasnt even that goodbr br the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent messbr br it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off i rated it a 1 out of 10 because imdb wont allow me to use decimals
