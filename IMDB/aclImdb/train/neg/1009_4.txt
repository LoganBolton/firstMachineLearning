 review may contain some spoilers  ill make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well its pretty bad justin timberlake plays pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edisons police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called frat first response assault tactics hes teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named lazerov dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see lazerov  deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs i dont want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs pollack who works for ashford morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds  lazerov he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the frat team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justicebr br you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spaceys performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea  any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfyingbr br dont waste your time with this film im putting it on ebay this weekend
