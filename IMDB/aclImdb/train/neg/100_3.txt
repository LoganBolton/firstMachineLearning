ok its not the best film ive ever seen but at the same time ive been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the waybr br and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name callingbr br overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it
