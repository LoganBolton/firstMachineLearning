if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating its this pile of crap i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity i actually began to feel angry watching this film because its so insultingly poor i cant believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptablebr br theres no plot and the nonplot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking the people dont react act or in any way resemble human beings the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be the whole thing is one pointless mess it doesnt go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and dont do very muchbr br i could make a better film than this so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before its pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all timebr br honestly the very worst movie of all time youll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 1010 and urge you to buy the dvd i cant imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film its terriblebr br 010 and thats generous
