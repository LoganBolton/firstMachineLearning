zombie nation 2004 rbr br hey i was bored i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch zombie nation hey i love zombie movies says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description funny how it doesnt warn me not to watch this film i couldve used that advicebr br zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that its completely misnamed it has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city this film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them yup hes a serial killer cop not only is this film flawed in thinking that its a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it this guy knocks out the women and injects them with some poison he doesnt even have sex with the corpse or dismember it talk about boring eventually one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy they were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldnt know it buy the sharp clean clothes theyre all wearing the women then act very poorly and take their revenge oh yaybr br this film was crap in every category crap acting crap writing crappier sets and crappier makeup effects the women dont look zombielike unless you count really dark makeup around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie they can all talk behave think and act perfectly human the gore is weak compared to even many pg13 films and the nudity is beyond brief you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence then the exact same breasts later go figure guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse theyre obviously filming in you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse setup and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing steer clear its a waste of timebr br 110
