yeah im sure it really could be a nation    if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times man i am really glad that i saw this movie on fearnet instead of renting it im a big fan of the george romero movies and im pretty sure that if he saw this movie hed probably throw up while laughing too hard i mean what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlies devils it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shoppolice stationapartmentflatwhatever room it was with the gong in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop i couldnt even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didnt help either oh well what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world so for all of those who worship mystery science theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad c movies c for craptastic then this is the movie for you    or not
