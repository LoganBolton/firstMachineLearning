last weekend i bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the deadbr br boy was i wrong br br it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrebr br we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i couldnt suspend my disbelief anymorebr br some people actually consider this a so bad its good movie they are liars i didnt finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughbr br this is even worse than zombiez do not watch
