btk killer green river killer zodiac killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is he loves his crapbr br ive never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful like the movies i said in the beginning dont even equal a six when added together after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is he is the worst out therebr br the credits wouldnt end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots the editing is easily the worst this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldnt take it anymore as it wouldnt end and i was only 45 minutes in the movie i couldnt take it anymore i wasted 45 minutes of my lifebr br do not watch this crap
