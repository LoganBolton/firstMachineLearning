i rented this movie last week i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it so it seemed promising and it was until justin timberlake came on scene he is a really bad actor and shouldnt be allowed to make a movie ever again i mean he is one of the most boring uninspired actors ive ever seen he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack i think matt damon would have been a better choicebr br kevin spacey was another big disappointment his character is so dull it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en it might sound cool but believe me its notbr br now dylan mcdermotts acting is very good its about one of the very few good things about this movie he is just inspiredbr br morgan freeman is good but nothing special he has some really cool lines thoughbr br about the story although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good i was expecting a big twist when lazerov dylan mcdermott was killed but nothing really happened
