i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertisingbr br its not enough that the movie itself is a pos but the cover art is what sold me ive done better makeup effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon eyesbr br im not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movies main character is an la cop who was born and raised in alabama  but has a german accent its beyond insulting
