this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence however after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence however out of no where when they are on a luxury cruise the ship sinks and they lose everythingand end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life what an odd silly and preachy film personally id like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserablebr br the production values are relatively poor compared to later productionsa rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting
