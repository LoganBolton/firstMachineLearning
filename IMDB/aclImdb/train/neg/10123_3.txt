i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together the talk is not of the masters great films like north by northwest or strangers on a train but a lesserknown effort like this one from 1931 obscure and seriously flawed which showcases the great director in fledgling formbr br emily and fred hill joan barry and harry kendall are a middleclass london couple scrimping to stay ahead he begrudges their lot she accepts it change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury they make plans for a world cruise but their problems have only begunbr br just ask richard hannay roger o thornhill or marion crane well marions indisposed at the moment but you get the idea travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight setting one up for a perilous journey at best this is perhaps hitchcocks earliest foray into this theme and not his most successful or memorable hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element in this case domestic drama rather than suspense but the two do not cohere at least not herebr br the hills are a dull flat couple with no chemistry or personality when they find themselves at the folies berg√®re in the form of crosscutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers the curtains gone up too soon gasps emily they arent dressedbr br when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing even if the people they partner off with are drips too emilys man gordon percy marmont carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs which he suggests be filled by emily freds girl the princess betty amann has clara bows eyes and wallace beerys five oclock shadow theres also an obnoxious fellow passenger a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue subtlety was still to comebr br everything is shot in an abrupt manner with confusing blocking and strained dialogue hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesnt come off and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears when fred and emily break off they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedgedtogether rickshaws one of many clunky attempts at symbolismbr br emilys the only vaguely sympathetic character in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon but mostly because shes among the first of hitchcocks many magnetic blondes her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the films conclusionbr br matters conclude with a dangerous situation as setpiece for the protagonists to come to grips with and presumably repair their relationship only they arent active participants in the resolution and except for the fate of a friendly cat nothing about the ending resonatesbr br at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food rich and strange is hitchcock paying his dues and learning his trade one for scholars but not casual film goers
