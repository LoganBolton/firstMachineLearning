this show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from british society as a whole it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there wereare no class divisions in britain theyd always say things like go into your loft and you may find this or go into your back garden tonight and  what about us scummy working class kids who never never had a loft and a back garden which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block public service broadcasting  yeah right and on top of that it was awfully depressing to see those stupid middle class uptheirownbackside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having fun do me a favour and why dont you go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on mama and papas money you make me sick
