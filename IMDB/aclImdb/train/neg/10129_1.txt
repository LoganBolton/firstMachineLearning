i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie i can honestly say id rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the acting was so awful that it was almost funny the story was insanely weak with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f117 through them the script was so poor if i found out that a 10 year old wrote it i shouldnt be in the least surprised the direction and production is so amateur i wouldnt even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video utter utter drivel those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i cant imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entire life
