well i can once and for all put an end to the question what is the worst movie ever madeever it is flight of fury starring and cowritten by steven seagal sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriouslybr br it is a romanianmade film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean againbr br it was released only on video i cant imagine why and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvds had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling
