unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutesbr br the plot  even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely coherentbr br the acting  unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in pornos ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a lesbian love scene which is utterly cringeworthybr br special effects  wouldnt look out of place in a 60s sword and sorcery flickbr br unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures dont make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back
