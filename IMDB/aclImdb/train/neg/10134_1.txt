steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worsebr br this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people in self defence hes active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich√© evil english villain that hollywood is so obsessed with including these daysbr br suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isnt interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the lesbian interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isnt even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didnt need tobr br in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by subpar actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and nonrelevant parts that only serve to achieve the nearimpossible and make the movie even worsebr br save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagals most ardent fan
