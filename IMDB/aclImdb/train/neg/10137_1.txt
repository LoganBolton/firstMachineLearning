first of all f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraftbr br secondly the f14s and f18s cannot change their appearances they are not transformers br br thirdly the f16 has only one m61 cannon not two br br last but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing f18s and f14s being mysteriously transformed into f16s this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16br br when students hand in really bad work teachers assign 0s now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a 010 option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10
