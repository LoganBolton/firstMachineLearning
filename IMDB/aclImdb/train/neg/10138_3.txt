over the years ive seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley the entertainment level is at a low sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege under siege 2 and executive decisionat least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualificationsbr br on the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter i honestly believe that more of segals movies would do better if he wasnt the only one that fans recognize in the movie supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results
