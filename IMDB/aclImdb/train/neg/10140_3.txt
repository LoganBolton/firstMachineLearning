this movie should have never been madebr br what a shame of the budgetbr br please hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie br br definitely not worth watchingbr br they keep replaying the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth rerunning 3 or 4 timesbr br it is time for steven seagal to retire from moviemakingbr br his movies are getting worser every timebr br black dawn and submerged were already bad but this movie is even worse
