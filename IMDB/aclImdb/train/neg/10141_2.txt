steven seagal mr personality himself this time is the united states greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the militarywho attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas stationif he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor jannickmark bazeley john sandsseagalwill fly into enemy territory receiving help from his arab lover jessicaciera paytonand a freedom fighter rojaralki david once they are on ground jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders stonevincenzo nicoliand his female enforcer elianakatie jones and sands must figure out how to not only retake command of the kidnapped stealth fighter but rescue him as well and maybe sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained rathersteve toussaintin the process sands has 72 hours until a generals navy pilots bomb the entire area on board the stealth black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb hoping to detonate it on the united statesbr br seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isnt slicing their throats with knives the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead the setting of afghanistan doesnt hold up to scrutinynor does how easily seagal and co are able to move about the area undetected so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about the movie is edited fast the camera a bit too jerky seagal isnt as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes unlike the good old days one of seagals poorest efforts and hes as understated as evernot a compliment even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the films chief villains tis a shame he doesnt even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible waysure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around but its not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying closeups
