flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x77 a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job  everything goes well until the x77 disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan  delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x77 to fly into us airspace undetected  drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane  sends in one man army john sands cowriter  executive producer steven seagal to get it back  kill all the bad guys in the processbr br this american british  romanian coproduction was directed by michael keusch  was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006  attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the partnership wasnt working  an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaborations between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost sceneforscene wordforword remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael dudikoff with many of the same characters even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder  therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made  written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days its boring even though its not that slow the characters are poor its full of clich√©s things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent  its a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame  theres no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes  its right down there with the worst seagal has madebr br flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isnt even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky  the quality of film changes very abruptly as its all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shootouts so badly edited its hard to tell who is who  of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap  shoddybr br the imdb reckons this had a budget of about 12000000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania  the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect  seagal looks dubbed againbr br flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish  is an almost sceneforscene remake of another film anyway another really lazy  poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more
