following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to outstink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie careers decline where attack force was a hodgepodge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a hightech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs seagal has to get the plane back its that simple no annoying subplots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works thats not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though its pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for examplebr br in filmic terms fof is bad its badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost hes just got the look of a toddler whos been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness can we blame seagal though when the material is so unambitious and cruddy not really this is the final film of his castel studios multipicture deal the producers cant be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a 12 or so million dollar budget and after seagals obligatory 5 million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining 7 million then im elvis pressley so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film thats already got distribution sorted before its made fans though may argue he at least owes them the effort hes seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dubovers is further indication of this michael keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with castel a bog standard stunt team theres nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again theres a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we dont want to seebr br overall the action isnt too bad its nice and violent and on occasion were treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and reappears after with little explanation theres far too much stock footage used using stock shots isnt an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is were treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changingbr br the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even perks up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but thats not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this ones existence
