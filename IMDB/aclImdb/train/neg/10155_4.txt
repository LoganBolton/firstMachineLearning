i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a 23 year old political science student and i think im going to change the world too so i relate to megan besides shes cute shes no super model but more of a cute girl next doorbr br ok so she cried and screamed a lot its very dramatic and seems overdone but doesnt it fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was inbr br as for the movie in general other than megan it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by microbudget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any contemplation its basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the sadism of the doctor he kept ripping megans shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw hick was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best characterbr br i give this film 4 out of 10 it had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is microbudget horror
