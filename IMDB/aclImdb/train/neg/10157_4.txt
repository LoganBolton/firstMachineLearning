slasherswell if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise dont even botherit is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for themalso try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call themthe basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever lives at the end gets rich now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these daysfor example when i watched it i thought to my self i wouldnt mind having a go at this game especially for 12000000 so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind
