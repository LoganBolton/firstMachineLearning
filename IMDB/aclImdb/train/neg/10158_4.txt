i couldnt help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon a massively more amazing film when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea this could have been a great film the acting isfrom some of the actors alright from othersits downright horriblebr br that aside the idea is great and the format is great the story is pretty good as well though suffering often from big blows to the logical mindbr br nevermind that though right it is a horror movie after allbr br i really want to see this remadei really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to bebr br however and you cant really fault the minds behind the movie for this this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget and the fx really hurt the film overallbr br great movie if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fxbr br whoever wrote it should keep going though great idea here
