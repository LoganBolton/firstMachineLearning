more wideeyed hysterical 50s hypercheerfulness that gives new meaning to antisocial pathological behaviour danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercybr br its a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead or in nursing homes i kinda thought about suing them for torture as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor defenseless eardrums i felt instant strong pain envelop my entire being that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits nevermind glassbr br why didnt you switch the channel if you didnt like it you might ask angrily fair point fair point the answer is that i wanted to but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor writhing in agony with my last ounces of energy i tried to reach the remote but couldntbr br a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven who then proceeds to pigmalionize him lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up this may seem like a rather thin plot but this noisy movie is so chockfull of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all this movie is relentless forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayers reign in blood as in a south park episode whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world its all infantile  as if they were all 6 yearolds impersonating grownups i can only envy people who find movies like this funny it must be great being easytoplease what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious gutbusting comedy br br but lets examine this phenomenon the 50s musical my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more daydreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven depending on whether youre churchgoing or leninstombgoing or at least very cheesy version of these fantasyinspired places ttono is more akin to a representation of hell but thats just me i dont seem to get musicals people talk there is a story  but then allofasudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened when you think about it musicals are stranger than any sciencefiction filmbr br worse yet ttono my favourite type of pizza btw is not just a 50s musical but one with opera squealing opera is proof that there is such a thing as overtraining a voice  to the point where it becomes an earpiercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet i tried lowering the volume i lowered it from 18 to 14 then from 14 to 10 then 8 i ended up lowering it to a 1 which is usually so low that its only heard by speciallytrained dogs and certain types of marsupials and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeysbr br take the scene in the small boat in the river danza starts off with one of his deafening brainkilling tunes and then nothing no animals anywhere to be seen even the crocodiles who are mostly deaf have all but left if you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes no this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the flora and those trees were just matte paintings imagine how real trees would have reactedbr br the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous selfexplosion i can listen to the loudest least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache
