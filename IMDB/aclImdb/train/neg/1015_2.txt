pathetic worse than a bad madefortv movie i cant believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freemans character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync boys girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearablebr br i rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked
