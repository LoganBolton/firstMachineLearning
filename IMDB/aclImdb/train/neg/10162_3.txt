this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california she thought it was wonderful because it was so real just the way people in the ohio valley are im from the area and i experienced the film as just the way people in california think we are ive lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there we laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere elsebr br aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dreadbr br marthas character was the worst drawn its doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there ive read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isnt shown all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurtbr br just one more thing are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks please this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level
