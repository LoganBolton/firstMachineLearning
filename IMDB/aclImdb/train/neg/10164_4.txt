i just saw this at the venice film festival and cant quite decide about it we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own but these people didnt compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates at a running time of just over an hour the characters werent very well developed lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment forklifts conveyor belts shovels and the slightlycreepylooking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes that most of the characters made for a living were somehow more interesting than the live people an interesting experiment but somehow it never quite came together
