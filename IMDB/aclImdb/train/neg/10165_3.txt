san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didnt even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh ive been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrapstinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competentbr br the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminariesbr br the white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didnt know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal  really folks everyone knows its not groovy to live in the ghetto  but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting this was notbr br the hunters point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco youve seen it done before and youve seen it done better even the video game was better br br despite the generic nonlocality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong handsbr br ps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one
