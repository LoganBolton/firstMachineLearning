the championship game is only a couple of days away but things in new orleans arent as they should be from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable wonderful time can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined br br despite what you might think when you first read about superdome this is not a football movie in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought instead superdome is another of those lousy soap operaish 70s madefortv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good the best or worst example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why hes there the plot is dull uninteresting and unbelievable donna mills as a hitman yeah right its about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen the movie also lacks any pace trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had with no drama or suspense in sight superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s madefortv movie the lone highlight for me was the voiceover work from the late charlie jones  a sportscaster i miss listening to the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and overhypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finestbr br like most others who have seen superdome i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 it may be one of the ktma public access episodes but its one of the best examples of the shows early start so even though ive only rated superdome a 210 ill give this episode a generous 35 on my mst3k rating scale
