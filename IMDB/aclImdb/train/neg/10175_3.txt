couldnt go to sleep the other night so i got up flipped on the tube  this movie was onbr br film makers bit off more than they could chew just as ambitious in scope as forrest gump was but gump read like an fairytale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era tgmb just relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up every characters purpose was to fill a silly 60s archetypebr br take how were introduced to finnegan hugging his black maid  receiving a framed picture of mlk criminey talk about heavyhanded why not just give him a tshirt saying i heart black peoplebr br sunshine isnt free love groovay man oh no i didnt have my period br br mary beth i want to go to berkeley not square ucla uh excuse me there was nothing square about la in the 60s rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique we just hear this brat whine about not going therebr br cant even remember the black kids name he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids arebr br thing is period pieces dont have to be this cheesy take dazed  confused look how were introduced to the football hero randall floyd we dont first see him on the football field in fact we never see him play football were introduced to him in class inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a partybr br in dazed feminism isnt a casual byproduct of some chick getting knocked up its much more organic more serious than that its refined in the ladies room over a flip discussion about gilligans island serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings but real life is like thatbr br some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant i agree which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of babyboomer pornostalgia
