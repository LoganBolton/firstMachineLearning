how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls worst of all it doesnt compare to even the first installment of the series the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick onthefield action goes on too long bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nineinning shutout whats next major league 4 return to the little league ehh could be leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the allstar game this ones had three strikes too many
