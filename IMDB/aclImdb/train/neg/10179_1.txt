this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i cant believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you cant tell me this wasnt the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and dont watch this junk
