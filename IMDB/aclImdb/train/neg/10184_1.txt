for months ive been hearing about this little movie and now ive seen it i find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other peoples creative ideas in order to make their own onejoke premise of a movie troops swingblade any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywoods door then theyre doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase its animal house meets back to the future its wall street meets dead poets society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable
