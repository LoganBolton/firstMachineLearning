wheres michael caine when you need him ive seen most of the many seasons of mst3k but this rare pre1st season flick episdoe k20 is easily one of the worst movies ever made three stars lee majors chris makepeace and burgess meredith struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheneystyle workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness possibly on super 8 makes logans run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare i cant imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since its unwatchable even with it clearly whats needed in hollywood is some sort of 401k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care with its rights to pollute and drive theme by the end im half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his cold dead hands speech lee i could have forgiven you for this in 1989 but 1981
