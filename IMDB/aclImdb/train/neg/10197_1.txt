totally ridiculous if you know anything about poker you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker but i doubt hes ever played above 36 i think he also knows nothing of golf where to start ive seen better productions in the intro to film class i took freshmen year of film school the actors to watch in this movie are queen momma scotty nguyen and the loser who can never win at poker everyone else is as wooden as they come like bad porn actorsbr br spoiler the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made he is a railbird who doesnt play poker and never has a line of dialogue but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie i cant think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production its fitting that he had such a useless rolebr br theres very little poker in this movie most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots arent resolved in the slightest queen momma does have a showstealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them their subtle performances are easily among the films highlights it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leadsbr br in conclusion complete nonsense plan 9 from outer space has slightly more coherency if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh also if youre christian you might enjoy some of the heavyhanded religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper i hate movies made by religious people especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about its sad that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty as i cant help but think less of them they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounders
