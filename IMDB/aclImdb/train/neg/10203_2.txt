well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasnt bad but it wasnt that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasnt predictable was done so badly that it didnt matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasnt really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad but i wouldnt reccomend it i gave it 2 out of 10 bc i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the 150 theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess youll like this one
