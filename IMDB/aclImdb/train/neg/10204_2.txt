at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning  in other words  they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the moviei suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt so now theres a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opiniondont waste your time or money
