a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through 96 minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didnt build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didnt really develop the characters the acting was soso most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didnt understand why there was so little or too much of the film i cant decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i dont even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br plot 010 characters 110 acting 210 overall 310 i feel like thats too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top
