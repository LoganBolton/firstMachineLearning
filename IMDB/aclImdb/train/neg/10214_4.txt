dick foran and peggy moran who were so good together in the mummys hand return for this very minor universal horror offering but this time instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick babe we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named stuff but the results are nowhere near as charming and the scare level is virtually nilbr br dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as the phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himselfbr br this phantom is not very mysterious and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness its always nice to see perky moran but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universals instantly forgettable misfires
