a horribly pointless and worse boring film stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way br br will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim careys truman show and substitutes his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights for well pretty much nothing br br emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews ive read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy please that she ended up falling for ferrells character is utterly ludicrousbr br marc forsters attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work withbr br i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this i wish id opted for the prestige
