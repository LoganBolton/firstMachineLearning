stranger than fiction angered me so much i signed up on imdb just to write this review stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex touching and thoughtprovoking movie until the very end once you suspend multiple lapses of logic why didnt will ferrell hear emma thompsons voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book the phone rang the phone rang again how could she not know its him calling etc the movie challenges ones thoughts about mortality fate and sacrificebr br the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faithbr br ah but the ending until the very end i would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie the movie as a metaphor for lifes journey as a tribute to the notion of writing true as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrells fate and no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending the last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film an end that would have been debated for weeksbr br no no credits rolled say it isnt so say hollywood didnt tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie dustin hoffman got it right when he said its no longer a masterpiece its ok an apt review of the movie except to me it wasnt even ok i was so offended about the betrayal of writing true about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie i dont often cry i could care less about most movies but i am still angry about this onebr br my questions for zack helm the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white and were you forced by the vapid movie powersthatbe to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself ive read youre brilliant i hope your original script ended the movie the first timebr br i know zack helm will never see this review and ive been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself but please moviegoers am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction one good thing came from me seeing this movie i doubly admire lost in translation now
