spoilers containedbr br id heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific what i didnt expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go what starts off as a typical cowboyindian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about honus soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss and cresta candice bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason they then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them so far so ordinary then comes the ending after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will theywont they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didnt resort to extreme gratuitous violence in some ways soldier blue reminds me of frank perrys last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending i didnt hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents i would recommend elem klimovs come and see
