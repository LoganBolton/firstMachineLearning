soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on mans inhumanity to man on the white mans exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things what soldier blue actually is is pernicious trite badly made dishonest rubbishbr br another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a lame clich√©d poorly acted odd couple romance  strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the others lifestyle and falling in love ah bless  bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldnt have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flickbr br there is no excuse for the repulsive prurient goredrenched climax in which cute little native american children are variously shot sliced dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic closeup and largebreasted native american women are molested raped and strung up  no excuse that is except box office the massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them intercut with a few specialeffects sequences of beheadingdismemberment  dismemberments incidentally which utilised real amputees in their filming now thats what i call exploitationbr br forget all the pap youve heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples this film doesnt give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curiousbr br which is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre about all of the real life massacres the us and britain and all socalled civilised nations have participated in over the centuries iraq this just isnt that movie
