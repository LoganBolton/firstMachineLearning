other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes this film is a true stinkerbr br this is the second film that ive seen in recent days directed by alexander korda the first was charles laughtons rembrandt it was so lousy that i shut it off this one im afraid is not very much betterbr br flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren it is absolutely no match in robotic fashion robson states her lines her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spiritbr br even a dashing laurence olivier cant save this utter piece of boredombr br future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesnt really convey anything here to think that scarlett was 2 years laterbr br its a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film
