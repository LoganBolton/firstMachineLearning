dont bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just marilynbr br the story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the vhs box of course there simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why nellie monroe was so messed up this was not a good role for monroe even though i didnt need to see this character to know she could act some like it hot alone was good enough evidence for me but this role just didnt fit her and its no surprise it wasnt one of her more popular filmsbr br its also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark anne bancroft elisha cook jr jeanne cagney donna cocoran and others br br summary its not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game
