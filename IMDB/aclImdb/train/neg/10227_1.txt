this is a wellworn story about a man who marries to escape the hangmans noose then sets about taming his reluctant bride it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time we never find out for example why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own this only made sense in fifties hollywoodbr br theres a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whipthe second timethen yanks her off her horse never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip then he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp thats some second wind later he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now shes his squaw never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and shes been negotiating with them for years and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on himyeah right like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trailbr br finally neither of the leads is convincing in their roles madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy the only reason youd root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the films end the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blowup dolls even if you do see them as dolls the total lack of suspense will bore youbr br total waste of time even the scenerys kinda dull give this one a big miss
