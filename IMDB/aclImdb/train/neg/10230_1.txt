happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this id be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is absent acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame and the change in tone of the lead characters reaction to the ghost is laughablebr br i can only agree that the glowing reviews of this film are from friends and family im afraid its not even entertainingly badbr br amateur in the extreme br br avoid avoid avoid
