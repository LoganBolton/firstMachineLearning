frankly im rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering have they all been written by his pals the action clunks along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the gardener mediocre at best i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying its brilliant when its not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again ie continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture yes its his first film low budget etc  i get it but its also out there for members of the public to purchase and its just not up to scratch
