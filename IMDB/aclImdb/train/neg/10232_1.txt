its one of those dramas thats so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad its good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesnt at least destroy any speeches theres continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this
