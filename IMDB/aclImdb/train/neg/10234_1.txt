ill keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly captivity is about a guy who drugs a girls drink imprisons and tortures her then poses as a captive to have sex with her that is the single twist and punchline of the film its torture as slow motion date rape and its not even a good movie its not so bad its good its just badbr br it should also be mentioned that among critics there is a spoiler code that they dare not break even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile why no one had the cojones to step up and say this is garbage and this is why is beyond mebr br dont give your money to these pooppeddlers
