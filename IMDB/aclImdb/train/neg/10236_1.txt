absolutely fantastic br br now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latt√©s allow me to elaborate much as i enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film ive seen at the cinema an impressive claim as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen the two leads daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst of course they werent helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne  celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence the plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to nonexistent and the gore scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic what plot there is revolves around a twentysomething model cuthbert who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout for my part i came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling filmmaking whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a filmbr br ps i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film freeso i can afford to laugh about it i was still tempted to ask for my money backit really was that bad
