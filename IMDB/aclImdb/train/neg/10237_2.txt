the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor a holocaust survivor part of mengeles experiments on twins consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments the movie obviously had great reviews its one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion aboutbr br i too for a large part of the movie got sucked into the emotion that the moviemaker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the sweetest nectar in one of the many dramatic sequences as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center the meaning of the word forgive is even debated but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own but by this time the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more after the strongwilled eva kor forgives her nazi captors the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about at least from the viewpoint of kor the movie goes about following her past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory to me this was the meat of the movie surrounded by inedible fat of her act of forgiveness obviously it was a very sick cowbr br on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness in order to heal wounds of the past she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some arabs to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis including one at a jewish center in chicago from then on anyone not so teary eyed that they cant see the screen will find it hardpressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statementsbr br firstly you immediately notice her body language defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time effort and money the entire act was a rather annoyed dr sami advan professor of education at bethlehem university gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartmentbr br finally the debate at the jewish center in chicago where she is grilled on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the actsbr br i will cut to the chase by the end of the movie i was hoping i hadnt chosen to watch the movie the movie was badly made failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears it showed that kor the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete unwillingness to listen or participatebr br lastly is everyone so retarded today that they cant notice the difference between making peace and forgiving quoting another imdb user i dont see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul she wanted the suffering to be over so she let it go that would be the perfect laymans definition of making peacebr br i guess in a world of propaganda blind faith and political correctness there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathombr br ps the dictionary certainly should go into all those bookstobuy lists everyone keeps making
