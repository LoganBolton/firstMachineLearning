jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value completely lacking in eroticism excitement or leading ladies with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild suspense and a onenote plotbr br the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between laws character and a dogged homicide detective well played by timothy spall but despite their best efforts both actors are staked to the cross of the films banalitybr br with a lesser actor in the lead role  and without the benefit of oliver curtiss cinematography  crocodiles would blend into the sea of lowbudget vampire quickies
