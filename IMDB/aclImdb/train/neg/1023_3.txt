ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected he did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department from the very beginning he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament hes in he acts as a sort of gentle giant  a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start  and he does an amazing job he was quite clearly the best character in the moviebr br this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor  and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner there are so many ways his character moses ashford could have taken a more pivotal role that he didnt was disappointing and a true letdown i was hoping to see more from him in this filmbr br timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive this movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past being an action movie it has its share of shootemup scenes blood and guts these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end  think of what you would typically expect in a goodcopsbadcops conflict  and it bears little resemblance to a real police shootoutbr br what irked me most was the way timberlakes character behaved during shootout scenes he starts out having guns and not using them then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if hes been firing a gun his whole life then he runs out of bullets and doesnt have a gun  and 30 seconds later without moving or anything  suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for mebr br if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay then youll probably love this movie personally it doesnt matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic make me believe that the story is true this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied
