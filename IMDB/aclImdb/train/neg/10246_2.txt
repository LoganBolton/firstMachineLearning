end of the world is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist im not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark roomat least thats the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly topsecret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out theyre on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space hes ever been able to decipher his wife tells him theyre going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party  moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesnt help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or zgrade scifi plus theres lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed
