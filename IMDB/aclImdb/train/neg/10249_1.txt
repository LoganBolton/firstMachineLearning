what can i say about this film other than dont see it i waited and waited and waited for someting or anything to happen and it just didnt come watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie what are they doing are they solving a mystery are they gathering clues possibly its just hard to tell at the end of the movie after a lot of radio signals are decoded illegibly on some sort of pet monitor and this guy gives some lectures the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth i guess they dont like sharing the wealth my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art garbage and decided that theyd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film watch at your own peril its not even funny because its so bad its just bad
