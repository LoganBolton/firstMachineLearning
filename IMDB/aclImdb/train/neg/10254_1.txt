spoilersbr br wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experiencebr br here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so hes trying to figure out whos receiving the messages and whos also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and hes gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesnt see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the endbr br thats it br br ive never seen such a dull movie in my life its the most underwhelming movie ive ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they dont care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they dont even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasnt expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didnt expect it to be this badbr br christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well im sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst its beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever
