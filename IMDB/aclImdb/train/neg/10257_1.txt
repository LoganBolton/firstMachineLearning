this film had a great cast going for it christopher lee dean jagger macdonald carey lew ayres  solid bmovie actors all but this downer of a movie didnt use any of them to any sort of advantage with none of their characters even meeting on screen though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenesbr br the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat first they just want to repair their ship and leave then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need then out of nowhere this peaceful race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many diseases though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their societybr br most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end just in vengeance for boring us to deathbr br unless you really like chris lee or seventies lowbudget scifi id give this one a miss it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo target earth
