wow i just saw this on tv as one of the scary movies they show around halloween was this rated g there wasnt really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching also other people say this is a spoof but i dont think so for a spoof you need something called humor this lowbudget crapfest didnt have a shred of humor and it didnt make much sense either you basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of closets killing people i guess since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster so i guess thats good enoughbr br the military tries feebly to kill the monster which isnt much larger than a man they have very bad aim then the military flees wow did this movie make the us military look pathetic or what the monster while hard to kill doesnt do much besides shuffle around and roar oh and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks it was a slightly interesting yet a total alien ripoffbr br what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality also why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long why didnt the monster go into the closet when it had a chance why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless
