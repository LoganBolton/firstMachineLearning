1st watched 11072004  1 out of 10dirjon keeyes overthetop rehash of 70s supposed horror flicks like friday the 13thversions 1 thru whatever i cant think of much redeeming here exceptor can i think of anythingthe story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an homage to this supposedly but lo and behold one of the stupid people have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murderedagain how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this guess what the murderer is at it again and were tipped off from the very beginning who it isso there goes any mystery whatsoever and besides all this where are the cops and why doesnt someone call them i cant believe this movie was financed by someone and made you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher at least in their moviegoing experience but not so by this filmmaker
