when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sounded really interesting so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the 4 for 20 dollars section at blockbuster when we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks lets put in something else ill admit a few of the lines from the friends at the caf√© made us smile a little bit but come on at least get some decent actors every once in a while in a movie if the acting is bad and the movie isnt going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how theyre overor underdoing their lines but i can only take so much crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter there was no delivery for their lines amateur doesnt even come close to the acting in this filmbr br anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie its the most pointless thing ive ever had the displeasure of watching do not watch or buy this movie
