when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore subpar production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it cant even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either its embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance its quite easily one of the worst movies ive ever seenbr br i dont normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie dont miss the making offeaturette the writerdirector seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if its a newage citizen kane its like listening to a group of thirdgraders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think theyve created something of substance its sad reallyÂ… the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because i think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but id have to say that its somewhere in the bottom fifty
