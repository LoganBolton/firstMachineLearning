so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film and you might be thinking to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 funny thing is most of these rave reviews sound like theyre coming from the same person or at best a small coordinated group of open house groupies the truth my friends is that this film is truly unwatchable just because its independent doesnt mean it gets a free pass if youre going to make a musical whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse you should probably make sure that a your actors can sing b your actors can dance c you have decent sound equipment d you have a wellwritten score and e you have lyrics that are witty and charming even anthony rapp cant save this one its one of those unfortunate moviegoing experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved
