i hate to sound like an old person but frankly i havent seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960 generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle the bread my sweet except for the de rigeur sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie this movie makes the mother a former las vegas chorus girl seem to be incapable of surviving on her own although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s i didnt buy it im 57 and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s more than capable of surviving on my own as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at 13 got legally emancipated and set off on my own lifes journey br br the daughter is not believable in her job role  she gets a promotion she doesnt deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver the writers shoot her down as an opportunist when she was just doing what any careeroriented person would do  taking advantage of a wideopen opportunity created by the lack of selfdiscipline of her coworker a girl who apparently doesnt understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss in this casebr br the daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her on a temporary basis but then treats her mother the woman who gave her life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is not the common thing for parents to act like children and then be treated as children by their children that is just more of the societal baloney that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we their public were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offeringsbr br this is a sad movie with a stupid ending if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a twodimensional tv character hed have stayed with the mother who was not that much older than him and quite attractive but in the end he falls for the daughter a shallow rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth but in an ordinary bland way the opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive physicallybr br there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight selfish selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother  a woman who was kindhearted sweettempered humorous and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend of course the mother had her own flaws she had reacted to her husbands demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughterbr br regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney wheres the mustard
