although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasnt what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please dont eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a loselose situation on one hand i still dont get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please dont eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely loselosebr br im not even sure what genre theyre going for here just early 80s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the nonflashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10 i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now were in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys dont kill them although i wouldnt have minded if they had in the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isnt saying muchbr br for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a halfhour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but its stupid i guess i didnt exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish bentertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious bmovie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please dont eat the babies 310
