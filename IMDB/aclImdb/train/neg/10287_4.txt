this is available on a drive in double feature from dark sky films and since i just had finished up barracuda i watched this too this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same timebr br we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor and try on chinesestyle clothes at a shop but then we see some aztec dancers and all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didnt have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch thembr br it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot and where did she get it so in flashback we go back to find out and how did they know she had this coin hard to say reallybr br now back in the day when these two women were 10 years old they were out with their sisters and their sisters boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they tow this young boy back to his home dock only to have his grandpa come out  invite the young uns up for herbal tea with granny but not everyone has the tea todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when theyre away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it herbal teabr br but the girls and todd did leave the island but now theyre returning escorted by their captors and theyre there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before there also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since theres only three it doesnt take long and theres even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the filmbr br the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability theyre borderline hilarious the hillbillytype family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden who appeared in many films and tv shows the action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like southern californiabr br so what the hell is this im not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh 4 out of 10 very bizarre
