first of all i just want to say that i love this show but this episodethis episode makes a mockery of the entire showbr br i dont know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire seriesbr br there is no story line everything is chaotic and the jokesare crapbr br the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game for example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously onis simply embarrassingbr br its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad
