i dont remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlakes in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in patton or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the pointbr br timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben afflecks acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench with his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like the 25 cliché expressions for actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateurturnedcrusaderforjustice journalist it simply will not flybr br however timberlake alone isnt to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary elwes and im surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlakebr br there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our socalled hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh airbr br but enough of timberlake bashing  words arent enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very runofthemill corruption story its plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like serpico or donnie brasco or maybe even chinatown dont get me wrong  edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through itbr br the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between piper perabo who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawsons creek episode its your typical fartooglibforreality letsimpresstheaudiencewithhowwellwearticulate and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments  sometimes it feels like edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slowmotionbr br thinking about it edison is a curiosity its sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesnt work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they dont seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture and its not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
