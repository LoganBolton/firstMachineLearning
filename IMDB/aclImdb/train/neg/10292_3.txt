it has its merits morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments shes so enigmatic so original is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one thats making her so distant and unrelatable or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary personally id call her dysfunctionalbr br morvern is completely detaching herself disposing of her boyfriend not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain shes seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity she may as well have killed herselfbr br despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the directors shots were superb the lighting and color made the film visually stunningbr br its really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest its little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you dont care about the characters or the film
