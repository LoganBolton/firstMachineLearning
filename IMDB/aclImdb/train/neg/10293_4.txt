my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions and mostly artsy films that require thought i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom my wife has double the attention span that i do all that being said this film is just plain empty and boring it went nowhere never blossomed it started fairly strong with a promising plotthen she bakes cookiesgoes to spainshe sulks she staresthe credits roll uneven full of holes false starts  dead ends we ffd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried zzzz its like a beautifully shot chickflick thats pretending to be deep or artsy you never get to know nor understand morvern at all about halfway through you just dont care anymore we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop dont waste your time on this im shocked it scores so high
