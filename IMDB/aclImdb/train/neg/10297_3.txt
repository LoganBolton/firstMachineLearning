when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words im not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of uspeople like morverndo no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a pointpossibly the sum of the entire story is the pointand that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesnt substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothingbr br this is not the usual complaint of a booklover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the halfeducated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance despite morverns own selfcharacterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a workingclass scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldnt deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldnt get out of my head was his characters attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person whos always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful sloggingthrough unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophicaland that doesnt begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morverns responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a crosssection of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book i can see thisbr br the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting shes rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesnt have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy seriocomic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isnt at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isnt scottish the actress said in an interview she hadnt had time to study up the accent and she ought to be its important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness its winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest whats left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead
