it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person not even as an extra that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general  howeverbr br no spoilers  only a brief introductory descriptionbr br buddy portrays four young people living in a flatshare in oslo the protagonist are two young men that dont manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility  a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the clich√© although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a young person one can sort of identify with the characters crazy situations and complicated love affairs i dont find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as friends yes that show on tvbr br has norwegian film finally found its identity audience pleasers in well known american stylebr br how about watching lukas moodyssons tillsammans together
