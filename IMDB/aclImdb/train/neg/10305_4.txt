as an engineer i must say this shows first season started out very promising most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edgebr br but after the first season the show started degrading heavily most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science  technology for realbr br the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode but in the end this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop showbr br if you are gonna watch it go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second thereafter i would not waste my time myself i gave the show up midway through season 3br br season 1  8 stars season 2  5 stars season 3  3 starsbr br lets sum that up to 4 stars since charlie doesnt know his math anymore i wont bother with the correctness of mine either
