the math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow although his career must have been undeservedly waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlockbr br the lameness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode costarring lou diamond phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned in order to catch a fugitive the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles so he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places a b and c then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be he does this all on a chalkboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant rememberbr br anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said ok mathematically heres where we are most likely to find the fugitive at which point one other character points out oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live is that math its not even connectthefkgdots this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either lesscomplex analysis or basic common sensebr br it just goes to show  when youre a hammer everything looks like a nail i cant wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama theyll use calculus call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields cuz hey its all about the numbersbr br totally ludicrous tv show
