lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers oj simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit im not a fan of lorenzo lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to oj simpson and lamas comatose wife kinmont lamas seems like ah jeanclaude van damme i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the oj simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldnt escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of oj simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic br br  out of 4bad
