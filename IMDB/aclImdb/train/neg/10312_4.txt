as an impressionable 10 year old i liked the love conquers all philosophy of the 70s sitcom bridget loves bernie i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver david birney and an irish catholic school teacher meredith baxter and both sets of parents harold j stone and bibi osterwald as bernies parents audra lindley and david doyle as bridgets parents who have issues with the young couples interfaith marriagebr br looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences i am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highlyrated season created by veteran tv writer bernard slade who a few years after the shows cancellation would write the successful play same time next year bridget loves bernie was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weightbr br there was no denying the reallife chemistry between birney and baxter but in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects birney in his shortlived role in st elsewhere and baxter in family and family ties here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subjectbr br the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses all in the family and mary tyler moore both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters bridget loves bernie was not very smart and only had some occasional chucklesbr br this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered
