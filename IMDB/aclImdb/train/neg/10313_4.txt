this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this builtin interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talkladen flick of this truelife event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the db cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a typewithout any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing
