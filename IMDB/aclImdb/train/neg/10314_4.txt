as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating truelife tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have beenbr br the bad  im a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigatorbr br the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbagemouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and thats too bad you can tell things arent right with the story i couldnt get involved with treat williams portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasnt in this movie its also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy toobr br not everything was disappointing i cant complain about the scenery from the lush green forests of oregon to the desert in arizonabr br id like to see this movie remade and done better because it is a oneofakind story
