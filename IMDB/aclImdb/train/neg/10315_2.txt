i cant believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity theres something about mary leaves little reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loserbr br not once were any of the scenes believable the shots were badly timed and poorly framed the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoidbr br 210 the bonus is from the one time i smiled its not like im immune to humor or alone in my opinion my wife hated it too the next day we saw rush hour and laughed ourselves silly this movie just stunk
