up until this new season i have been a big little mosque fan however the new season had absolutely ruined itbr br the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad lightbr br i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any morebr br just cancel it and be done with it its not worth watching any morebr br it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be madebr br bring back the old format
