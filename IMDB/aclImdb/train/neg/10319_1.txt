unlike many i dont find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive its execution however is another matter entirely like so many bminus movies all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers for most of the 22orso minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical overemoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a latenight infomercial but not a primetime sitcom even a canadian one notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas unfortunately they got the tone  and the script  completely wrong for the prairies the final insult is that they apparently couldnt even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town why are they so hard to find in saskatchewan did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon and that the rest of the world primed by the cbcs publicists quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom
