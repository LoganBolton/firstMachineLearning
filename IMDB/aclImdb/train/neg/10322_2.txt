if youre looking to be either offended or amused or both youll probably have to look elsewhere lmotp really isnt even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clich√©s at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived messbr br beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place its just another lame innocuous and antiseptic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing and once the zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because its so shallow when judged on its merits alonebr br unless youre obsessed with muslim culture in the west andor are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really dont see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype other shows have better addressed the issue of culturalethnic dichotomy in western multiethnic societies lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight
