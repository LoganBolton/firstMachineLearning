while i have never been a fan of the original scoobydoo due to its horrid production values it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hannabarbera without a doubt scrappydoo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scoobydoo characters with it whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show i think death is preferable the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nervesand this is only in the better episodes after many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess i can see why in the liveaction scoobydoo movie they made the villain scrappydoosince practically everyone hates him
