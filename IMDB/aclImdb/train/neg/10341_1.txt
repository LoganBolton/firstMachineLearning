i rented this movie from the library its hard to find for good reason purely out of curiosity im a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment the bell jar 1979 is by far one of the worst movies ive ever seen the script is horrible not because it strays from the original novel text but because it strays without focus or intent the scenes are illconstructed and dont lead the viewer anywhere whats with the hokey voice over of plaths poetry lady lazarus has little do with greenwoods situation plaths poetry was completely misused marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood or any 20 year old for that matter partly due to casting she was 32 during filming the age plath was when she died and partly due to the fact that she cant act hassett is all emotion no craft no skill the direction is mediocre the director simply covers whats there which isnt much the only reason im giving the film a 1 is because 0 isnt an option sorry sylvia youll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting
