the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s this show quack pack shouldnt even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales its about a teenaged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hiphop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg theres no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales
