youd think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brainaddledbr br the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family everything is so very peachy and swellthe family adores bergman and things couldnt be more perfect well that is until the mother fay wray dies the stock market crashes in 1907 wiping out the familys fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet but not badbr br later after the familys fortunes have improved bergman returns the four boys are now all grown and there isnt really a conceivable reason why theyd hire her once again as a governess but briefly everything is swell once again but when wwi occurs the four all go to wargosh in the midst of this one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan hayward miss haywards character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and swell shes obviously a horny shedevil to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at warbr br now here is where the movie gets really really dumbbrainachingly dumb hayward begins an affair with one of davids brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not hayward with jack why why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the guttersnipe once and for all this is just a case of lousy writing and made me madand most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941br br the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for haywards evilness to be exposed this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess as expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once againhappy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut haywardbr br the film suffers because of poor writing haywards affair made no senseat least in how it was handled and having characters who are so goshdarn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a secondrate soap the only thing that saves it at all is the actingthey tried as best they could with a turgid script suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken
