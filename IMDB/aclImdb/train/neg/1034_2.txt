after the success of scoobydoo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt scoobydoo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and scrappydoo it was scrappydoo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scoobydoo doesnt need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews if they wanted scoobydoo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it
