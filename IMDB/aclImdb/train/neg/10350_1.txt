we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine lengles fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you im not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a madefortv movie would make up for its lack of razzledazzle in its script after all the star wars spinoff ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if id gotten too close to the black thing while tessering br br the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard star trek first contact and radio as our favorite starturnedmentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow thats right a crow moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold the majestic halfman halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than etbr br having gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tearinducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua in the film she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomeÂ…a jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs whatsit and the man with red eyes nicknamed the dude with red eyes due to his complete reinvention as a characterbr br the story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which didnt do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flatnosed wookies of ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earthlike camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil br br i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad its the way the characters are written that ruins it a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox in its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to selfrespecting people even madeleine lengle thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs whatsit was uglybr br score 0110 if i could br br prosbr br they got the names right br br cons br br it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main coverposter has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this symbolizes high adventure i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didnt even bother to photoshop megs arm on properly
