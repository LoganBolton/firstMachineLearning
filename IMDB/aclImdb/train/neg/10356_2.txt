this may be a bit on the spoilerish side i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed that of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a disney madefortv moviebr br a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago its got a great storyline that could hook children and adults plus its got built in quality sequels but disneyfying was not the way to go the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book it is a complicated and emotional story for kids there was no reason to make charles wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs ws as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that there was no reason to remove megs glasses that deprived us of what couldve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the bookbr br i could nitpick for days about little things but i also think larger things like the art direction was a off take for instance the way they made camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth it looks like earth it has people on it that look like humans the skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing but something is a little bit off the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth that is if we forget how to love it wouldve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as theyre walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythmbr br i unfortunately did not watch the end maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as wellbr br overall an artistic disappointmentbr br
