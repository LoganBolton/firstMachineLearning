i really didnt like this movie because it didnt really bring across the messages and ideas lengle brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it im afraid i cant say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didnt do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine lengle this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating dont see this movie if you are a big fan of lengles texts because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie
