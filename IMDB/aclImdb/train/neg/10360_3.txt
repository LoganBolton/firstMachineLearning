i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters didnt seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there wasnt a real connection with the viewer about what was going on the dialog didnt explain adequately what was happening it just seemed slapped together and rushed through all in all i was very disappointed with the movie i suppose if you havent read the book it might be ok by itself at the very least it might entice you to read the book which youll probably enjoy morebr br
