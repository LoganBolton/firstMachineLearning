this abc straighttotv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine lengle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms lengles work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is farfetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuar√≥n makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motelroom art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
