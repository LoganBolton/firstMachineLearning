or marlowe at sea yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey quite talky too bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation never nervous  no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and dames and other such nonsense is the only real male ie alpha male in the movie the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo  but he is only a fat alpha male male and  naturally  every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction the character clich√©s are all here bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynicabouttoreform as in casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them  but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him it doesnt so he cant be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a wellmeaning humanitarian i dont think so bacall does her nonchalant cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not alltoo interesting socalled sexual innuendo exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by todays standards just purse your lips and whistle a load of crap she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day her bony face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland the cuteness of a myrna loy let alone the likability of an irene dunne bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femmefatales in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character there are two or three bad musical numbers  but my fastforward button was readybr br if youre interested in reading my biographies of bogart bacall huston and other hollywood personalities contact me by email
