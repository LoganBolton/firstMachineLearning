i enjoyed the first reviewers comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a secondrun theatre in the early 80s i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings but to me the cast was largely squandered their personalities muffled by the masks while the direction i think of as being unusually static and the photography murky the rating jotted down at the time was a nought which means not worth sitting through even oncebr br still i too would jump at a chance to have a second look
