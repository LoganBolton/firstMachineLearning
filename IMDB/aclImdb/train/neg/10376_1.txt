i saw this film at a prerelease screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the films producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reactionbr br many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror filmbr br if the audience wasnt scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if theyd recut it as far as i can tell they hadnt it was the same lousy movie just a year olderbr br it almost qualifies as so bad its good but its slowpaced and boring
