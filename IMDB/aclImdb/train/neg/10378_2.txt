while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing the execution is downright pathetic im not even sure where to begin as ive got so many problems with this movie i suppose ill just number a few of them br br 1 the acting  when you see that edward albert doug mcclure and susan george and her teeth are the stars of your movie you know youre in trouble not that it matters much to me but these are hardly alist names susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy but ive never considered her the greatest actress ive ever seen and in this movie her acting is embarrassing as for the other two the less said the betterbr br 2 the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion rideat disney world and they are about as frightening and why did they have to be so obvious subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwellsbr br 3 the plot  how predictable can one movie be the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters if you couldnt see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes you need to see more moviesbr br 4 the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits absurd is a word that comes to mindbr br 5 everything else  its very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about i suppose ill give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the houses architecture thats a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesnt say much about the actual moviebr br ill stop you should be able to get the idea from what ive already mentioned and i havent even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems be warned this thing is horrible
