film starts in 1840 japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide its a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present daywell 1982 to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubbys work they rent a house andsurprise surpriseit just happens to be the house where the murders took place the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the familybr br sounds okbut its really hopeless theres a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious they look so fakei swear i saw the strings pulling one alongand theyre muttering theres a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes probably just to show off georges body another one about 40 minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believedbr br as for actingalbert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend but georgeas alwaysis terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed liftbut cant save it im giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film
