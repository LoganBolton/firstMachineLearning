that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these daysbr br first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real moviebr br i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didnt pick up someones camcorderbr br second indie films are supposed to be about real people theres nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely humanbr br what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he isbr br sorry but this is not good writing or good directingbr br what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films submittedbr br in any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand
