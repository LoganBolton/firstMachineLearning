its this one very cool premise right off the batbr br has an excellent first scene gotta give credit where credits duebr br has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared which i really liked by the way how it was done how it lookedthe only thing was the ghosts relationship because of the way things went down in the first scene youd think their dynamic would be differentbr br things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt and the crabspider scene was just not good but then the ending is actually very good sure the grudge basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurais and thats what i liked about this movie comparativelybr br please someone one with a tempered style remake this moviebr br fans of silent rage would absolutely love this movie
