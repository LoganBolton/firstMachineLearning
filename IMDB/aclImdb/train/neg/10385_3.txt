at the beginning of the film you might doublecheck the dvd cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times but no worries its not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional lets start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my alltime favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken its not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the lightblue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time youll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and overthetop like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak hisher lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesnt even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously oversized spiders or are they crabs in the daughters bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstepbr br trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demonmask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba
