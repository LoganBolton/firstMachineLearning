this could have been interesting  a japanset haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newlyinstalled american family  but falls flat due to an oversimplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and directorbr br the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare ie the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that theyre expected to besides it doesnt deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as susan george seducing diplomatfriendofthefamily doug mcclure and edward albert forcefeeding his daughter a bowl of soup br br at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually hes called upon to exorcise the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death at the end of the day this emerges an innocuous timewaster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but in no way essential viewing
