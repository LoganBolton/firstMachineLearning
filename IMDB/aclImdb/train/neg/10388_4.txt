from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb this movie seems to get ragged on a lot but i didnt think it was that bad ive seen much worse actuallybr br the house where evil dwells is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ted and laura fletcher and their daughter amy who move into an old house in japan little do they know a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword as strange things happen in the house the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan on reenacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years backbr br i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story it was routine and it was corny but ive seen worse in my day the ghost sequences were a little overdone we get to see the translucent bluetinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family and take over their bodies to be honest the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland i may be mistaken but after watching this it seemed to me that the japanese horror film juon the grudge and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ghostly activity curses put on the home etc but i may be wrongbr br to sum it up this is a pretty corny ghost story dont go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot 410
