raising victor vargas is just a bad film no amount of denial or addollar supported publicity with change this sad factbr br maybe peter sollett saw he didnt have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current edgy filmmaking maybe he just doesnt know any better its hard to tellbr br whats not hard to tell is the result except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad filmmaking into an attempt at pseudorealism few will enjoy itbr br i know i didntbr br do yourselves a favor and pass on this film
