i just rented and watched this movie just to see whats all the fuss about so heres what my reactions to it are its easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film however the movie doesnt shock or disturb me at all it just bored me this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described belowbr br contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame i dont know if i have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot heres a list on top of my mindbr br why dont the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are that would be an excellent timebr br why dont they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifers ordeal by such a long time it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that waybr br i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house maybe to show that these rapists are really imbecilesbr br these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldnt send a coward imbecile to do the jobbr br why didnt jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left which should be the first thing that pops up in most peoples mind especially for someone who is a writer br br why didnt these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alivebr br i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him ends spoilerbr br but hey this movie is not without its merits camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer why me why me i didnt even cm
