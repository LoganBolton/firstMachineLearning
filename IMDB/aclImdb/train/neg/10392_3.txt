im not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and theres almost no plot anyway ive seen several reviewers call isoyg an antirape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claimsbr br first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie thats right a shapely womans behind whether it was zarchis attempt to make an antirape statement  and i absolutely dont believe it was  is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy itbr br the rapes in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch theres something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before hes murdered so the scene isnt at all engaging on an emotional level really its just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowdbr br finally a few reviewers have commended zarchis socalled documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porncaliber actors do their thingbr br im not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg im all for exploitation  horror and love video nasties in fact im giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however its also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of hohum mostly goreless murders and wait for the credits to rollbr br this is probably worth watching once if youre a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but im telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation
