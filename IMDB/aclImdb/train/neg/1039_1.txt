this film is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seenbr br please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoctionbr br shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as direction which this film needed in droves not that the writing was all the wonderful rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way the pseudodocumentary style prized by those who dont know how to directbr br this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who dont know the first thing about filmmaking which is most of thembr br just terrible it says a lot about sundance and what its become that victor vargas was showcased there
