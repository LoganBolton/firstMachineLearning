without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films ive ever seen  this being one of them and camp blood being another br br the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crapbr br i bought this for £1 but remember you cant put a price on 71 minutes of your life youd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price
