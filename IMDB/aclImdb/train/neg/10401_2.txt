dear dear dear dear dearme i had the strength to see it through but whybr br the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing this was some kind of tremors for kids i cant believe this movie was made at allseems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind for kids and they just did whatever they could with itbr br what audience is this movie for i can only think of 1214 year olds if youre older than 14 youll have serious problems with this movie its not only slow but its so utterly boring the characters are overacted not just a little either and so stereotyped its fun for a whilebut not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen you know everything that is going to happen too cause yesyouve seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced its so badso wrongsocrapbr br but ok we did get a laugh now and then not just at the silly plot holes but some scenes where worth a replay or twoor one scene that is where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guysits really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly still makes me grin when i think about it but that only happened one more time sadlyand thats when the badass gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfullythat and one comment they spring from the ground like some demonic trout at this point we where almost crying with laughter but after thatnothing could ever top thatso its pretty much downhill from there br br so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting if anybody ever tells you this is a good moviehes either a plant vegetable or someone very evil this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far looking forward to seeing tremors 3 its bound to be box office hit compared to thisthisgoosebumps noill leave it at that
