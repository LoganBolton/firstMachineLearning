warning this review contains minor spoilersbr br well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas im a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare tremors 4 the legends begins however is a very dull movie where the heck are the graboids br br due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes im convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study unfortunately there isnt one interesting character in the movie except for billy dragos character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer whenever there wasnt any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too andor watch however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute br br on the plus side when the graboids dirt dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it getsbr br i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long pretty good for straight to video but after watching it im sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesnt further the plot any was there a rush to get this movie made i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the scriptbr br i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale withtremors what luck i thought pay for 4 get 1 for free well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free i cant imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4 for fans of the series its best to forget that tremors 4 the legend begins even existsbr br tremors 4 the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10
