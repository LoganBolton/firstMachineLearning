i found tremors 4the legend begins to be dull and boringall the action scenes were stupidthe so called graboids are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat if not smallerthe acting was horrendous and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed the story is so dumb and uselessalso if you want to tell a story way back in time make sure you use the same actormichael gross to be someone in the past when hes someone in the present in the other tremor moviesgeezif you havent seen this film dont waste your timestick to tremors 1 2 and 3 for a good timethis film however make sure youre remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense
