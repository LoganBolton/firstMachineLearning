if fassbinder has made a worse film i sure dont want to see it anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like the bitter tears of petra von kant this film bogs down with so much arty quasisymbolic images it looks like a parody of an artfilm the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elviras prostitute friend channelsurfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewers endurance but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her exwife andor her daughter these are the only moments that display any real human emotion and prove that at the core of this horrible film there was an excellent film struggling to free itself what a waste
