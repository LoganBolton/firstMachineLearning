i cant believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long long timebr br in a nobudget way it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreckbr br this film should be avoided at all costs its one of those festival films that only please the pseudointellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore goodbr br bad filmmaking is not different its just bad filmmaking
