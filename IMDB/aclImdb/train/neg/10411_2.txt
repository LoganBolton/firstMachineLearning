its funny ive seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting while others are repellent and selfindulgent messeslike this film for me it ranges from great to crapwithout much in the middle i know he has a lot of fans among the sophisticated but i cant help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype from my point of view and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this he made too many movies too quickly and was too selfindulgent his gay or genderbending films like this one tend to be really badsloppily done sometimes quite boring such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant and sometimes just gross like this film couldnt his message about acceptance of a persons genderconfusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympatheticthen maybe id care about the films br br im honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder filmsthe bad seems to be outweighing the good
