this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and hes noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but hes hardly in the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and theyre is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having theyre turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and theres the bloody standoff no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburtons lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel
