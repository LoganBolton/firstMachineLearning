2 stars out of a possible 10  and that is being overly generousbr br i thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou gossett jr and henry thomas  how could it miss i was wrongbr br i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the weekend he cranked out this piece of dribble id long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms itbr br this is the kind of artsy bs that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this moviebr br you havent seen dysfunctional families until youve seen this bunch pa is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughterbr br in addition to the above as if that werent enough the plotand its so thin you could read thorough ithas a hole in it the size of alaskabr br ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm as it turns out so is pa now i dont claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not workbr br not that anything else was really working anywaybr br the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i cant imagine why anyone would want to
