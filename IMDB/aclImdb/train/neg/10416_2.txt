before seeing this movie i wouldve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done now its everythingminusone james woods is patheticnot his character his acting someone shouldve told him that poor is not synonymous with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche ditto for randy quaids stereotyping the only redeeming feature is henry thomas who isnt a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess if you enjoy the country youll enjoy the scenery thats the best i can give itbr br im a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible
