this wouldve been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma im doing really big acting sort of waybr br everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedybr br mostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i couldnt tear my eyes away this dialogue mightve worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic workbr br if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pacebr br this script mustve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesnt work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camerabr br imdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computercontrolled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1br br characterdriven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isnt character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development thats a plot contrivancebr br stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps youll get some amusement from all the armwaving the characters dobr br oh and word to the wise  to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male lookatme imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof man glorybr br dont say you werent warned
