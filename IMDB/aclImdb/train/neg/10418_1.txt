this is not a childrens moviebr br this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of 5 for a month my 4 year old from timetotime would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasnt the worst of it we stopped it about a 12 hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately hes finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges  go ahead censure me my conscience is clear
