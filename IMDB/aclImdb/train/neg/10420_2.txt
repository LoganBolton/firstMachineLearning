ok i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a classic and a standard part of most peoples childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 i must admit i really hated itbr br we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who whimpered at the very words watership down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams recommended it to be honest i wish i hadnt bothered i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i dont like to stop watching a film half way through this was an exception it was really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull this film was possibly the slowest thing ive ever watched imagine a dopedup snail in space and really didnt do it for me the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly producedbr br im not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across for me i kind of wished that they would get gassed not because im a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh im so terribly english i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible anticlimaxbr br if i were to praise it in any way id have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite wellmeaning maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy but the message its trying to put forth is good in its nature the musical score was not bad toobr br so to conclude this film is pretty poor i couldnt watch it the whole way through or id probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom granted it isnt torque bad but it still doesnt rate highly in my eyes so ive given it a 210br br hope this helps
