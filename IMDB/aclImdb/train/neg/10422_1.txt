firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldnt believe how gory it was for a childrens movie bunnies being brutally murdered its just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over 8 to see this but dont get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasnt scarred mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a lets say 4 year old child to watch this its just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids im wayy over 4 and i was shocked by the violence i dont recommend
