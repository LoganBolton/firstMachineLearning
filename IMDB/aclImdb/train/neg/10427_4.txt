well they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied i dont know if stella james sean young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men shes still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now i cant agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though its by no means the worst of its type youll ever see and unlike the recent eyes wide shut at least something happens in this one
