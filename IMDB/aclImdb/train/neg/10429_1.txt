the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed its funny the producers even admitted they didnt have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didnt want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isnt really worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didnt happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb
