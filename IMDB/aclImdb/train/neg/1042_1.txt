first of all write the script on a napkin who needs more than that after all were not a hollywood filmbr br then get amateur actors it will be good for the festival hype after all who needs people who have spent years honing their craft then hire a cinematographer who doesnt know how to light you see if its welllit it wont look real and the festival people wont like it who needs to have professional level photography anyway then hire a tenyear old who has never held a camera to be your operator it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for reality and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people critics and a small sliver of the audience who overintellectualize will scream genius because they wont believe this was just complete amateurhourbr br once youve done that buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundancebr br what a sad waste
