there are many good things about the new bsg theres the multiple cylon roles for model 8 and 6 for example which the two actresses played superbly theres the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica my ship will not be networked over my dead body also all the space battles the special effects even though the seasoned scifi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all the darkness of the characters their essentially flawed naturebr br that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childishbr br yes the first part the scenes in space the raid on the cylons and all that was very good but the mushy ending i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden so i never know how much time is left until the end so for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen over and over again every time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more every frakking character got its complete ending that wasnt really necessarybr br what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all the young roslin scenes why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupilstudent what does that bring to the story where was the linkage now im all for a more europeanish style approach and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows and all that but this was just ridiculous this didnt bring anything meaningful to the storybr br also ive seen the last frakkin special and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldnt come up with a good ending for the story so  he just didnt its never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be the whole this was thousands of years in the past idea the mitochondrial eve thing was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and believe you me there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h2g2 storyline and speaking of hera now theres a storyline that was not worked out well at all instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil whos 20 years younger dont get me wrong im all for older women with younger men the more power to them but this  just made no sensebr br all in all the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be that goes even moreso for the last episode i hope lost and 24 do better with their series finales
