i loved the first season the quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle pegasus third season was fairly novel and original and was ok fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them what the hell was the cylon plan why were there two cylon factions what was the point of angelkara leading the fleet to a devastated earth1 what kind of a past did the last five cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations questions everywhere answers nowherebr br and then comes the end earth2 our earth in the past well okay but destroying the fleet giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people paperthinly across the planet thats not only antiscience its antireason and antilife and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive ai that ruins everything it is without vision without hope for a grander future for humanity and it is antithetical to proper science fiction and dont even get me started on the angels religious claptrap of the worst kind the ultimate disappointmentbr br the whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to earth as we know it making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius frakkin shamebr br 1 out of 10
