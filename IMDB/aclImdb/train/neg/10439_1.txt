id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie ive ever seenbr br i have no idea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditionsbr br 1 while being shitfaced  stoned out of their minds 2 theyve received hard cash for the votes 3 under gunpointbr br i cant believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie
