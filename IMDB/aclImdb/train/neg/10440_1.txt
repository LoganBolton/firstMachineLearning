unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from kenan thompson david koechner we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly thats it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left im so glad i did not pay for thisbr br despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even so bad its good material im very tolerant of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthybr br no this piece of over cgid rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and gigli how this is currently rated a 72 completely mystifies me brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answersbr br i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10
