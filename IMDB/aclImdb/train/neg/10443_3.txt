i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasnt even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snakebite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic im shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun its easy to understand that soap realizes its a piece of sit and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense its the worst kind of lame movie its joyless
