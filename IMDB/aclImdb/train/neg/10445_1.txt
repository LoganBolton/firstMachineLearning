this must be one of the worst movies ive ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection processbr br i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i cant say im picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just cant think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isnt one of those this kills your soul minute by minute
