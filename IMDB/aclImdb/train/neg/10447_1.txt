i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someones been fixing the scorebr br either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot  but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldnt it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and thats about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo typesbr br to sum it up its one of the worst movies ive ever seen  stay away
