oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone it reeks of cheese from start to finish but its not even good cheese its the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesnt even qualify as a sobaditsgood movie its just plain bad very very bad heres why look away if youre spoilerphobic the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you dont want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultraevil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish ie hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that hed watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plothole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact im going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the plot a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didnt hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes ill just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is  snakes yay oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans thats an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that weve met the cast lets watch all of them die except of course the cute kids dont expect anything original its just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the filmmakers obviously didnt use theirsbr br so thats most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep icecool sammy included but wait were not all off the plane yet the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jacksons hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the filmbr br actually were not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia its time for good guy and hero to get it onin bali nope it wasnt at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times thats it this is the first time ive ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel ljackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please dont see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that youll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united 93 instead that was good
