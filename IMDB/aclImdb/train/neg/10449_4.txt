this is not a film you can really analyse separately from its production the audience became the filmmakers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend how is it possible to be objective this is our movie isnt it or is it there may be nothing more disingenuous than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audiences friend giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them just look at that prime selfpublicist eli roth promising gorehounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like hostelbr br david r ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film but he was quite understandably quick to engage with it he took the carnivalhuckster school of filmmaking to a new level getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy so many have enthused over this interactive democratic approach to filmmaking that they seem to have missed the point  that this is the most cynical form of filmasmarketing nothing is included that the filmmakers know the fans wont buy and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to knowbr br isnt this just the evolution of the focus group approach individual creativity talent craft ideas all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses its a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings dont make for good movies  why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different because we happen to be film fans well thank god for us because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snakebr br so yes i had fun at the movie  a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of icecream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere like christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what there was laughter but i dont know if it was with the film or at the film with a film as calculated as this one is that even a meaningful distinction there are some genuinely good aspects to the film samuel l jackson gives a welljudged performance pure selfparody but with a real sense of pleasure rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulatebr br the stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isnt whats the point of a film that combines two great phobias if theres no creeping menace there are several snakejumpsout moments but theyre incredibly badly staged only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat the demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is shamefully botched most of the actors fail to make an impression its a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a rollercoaster she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far shortbr br there are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with lake placid and its as apt a contrast as any i can think of that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasnt devised by committee that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus i dont need a postpub midnight showing to have a good time with that filmbr br this film will in time fade to become a mere footnote in film history if it sets a precedent however im genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time in all probability nothing much will come of it perennial popcorn favourites  raiders of the lost ark alien halloween and of course star wars  just arent produced by groupthinkbr br in the mean time ill tell you what  i havent half got a craving for some ingmar bergman
