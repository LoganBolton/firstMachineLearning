raising victor vargas is one of those light family movies that you can watch and do the ny times crossword puzzle at the same time and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona you dont have to pause the dvd just let it roll cause you wont be missing anything really important no twists turns or tension its not really an ethnic movie its a movie about a poor struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino they could have been any ethnic group it made very little difference ive seen it all a zillion times before just plug in a jewish family an italian family a black family or an irish family just the accents and names were different if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians the movie would have been a total snooze br br its funny that the critics here couldnt get the locale straight some said it was spanish harlem some the bronx and another brooklyn as a lifelong new yorker i vote for the lower east side and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos they lived in an insulatedisolated little enclave some interaction with nonlatinos might have created some excitement interest or tension remember west side storybr br and now for the oftcriticized cinematography i dont know if it was my tv or what but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me the apt the furniture and the faces were all orange what was that supposed to mean and the apt did look pretty cramped to me somebody here mentioned that the old aptstenements had very big rooms well maybe 50 years ago what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them br br and another annoying thing this is the second family movie ive seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy jerking off is this private sex act necessary for us to watch please spare me whats up with these directors br br so victor vargas is a pleasant little movie it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents which they did but the writers let them down giving them a flat unspectacular script to work with enjoy the show but keep your fingers near the fast forward button
