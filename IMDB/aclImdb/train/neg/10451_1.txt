i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg overacted crap dont send an assassin its much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad its good its so bad id rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong its that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well im sorry i dont get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hungs cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupidbutt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance 12 monkeys clerks etc theres no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo ive said enough here
