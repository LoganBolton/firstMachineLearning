i saw the 10pm showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i dont actually pay for movies anymore i didnt really find any redeeming qualitiesbr br there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but lets be honest its a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screenbr br now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasnt going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some remake or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months
