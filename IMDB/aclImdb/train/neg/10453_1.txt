this movie deserves more than a 1 but im giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating thatll take it into the top 100 list seriously its not that great its not that bad its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys its ridiculous these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say im rick james btch no matter how old or annoying it gets i dread having to hear im tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny its crappy plot crap acting etc its okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad moviebr br wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
