what can i say im a secret fan of over the top action and horror films especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo but im not a fan of snake on a planebr br there are three potential draws to this film  the comedy of the situation  the horror and  the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane br br firstly this film isnt written as a tongueincheek horror or a comedy and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where youll smile to yourself if you want to get the feel of the film the trailer genuinely represents the movie a horrorbr br secondly if youre expecting a film full of action and shocks you wont be disappointed it doesnt stand out above other movies but it always keeps your attentionbr br thirdly although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesnt wear off but youll leave the cinema thinking what was all the fuss aboutbr br i know this movie has a high rating but it doesnt add up a many of the reviews where written before the film was released and b the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77 of people rating the movie 1010 with only 7 of people giving it 910  why such an enormous gap
