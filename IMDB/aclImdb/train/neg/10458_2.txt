i went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band wilcobr br instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process a dishonorable and no doubt onesided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singersongwriter a gutwrenching confession by the fallen members friend  for like 18 years  saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels oh the tensionnot they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didnt exist this doesnt even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline insight or even a decent job at cinematography the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watchbr br from the film this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they dont have and think theyre some kind of guardians for the art of music which they most definitely are not and i thought the music sucked and i couldnt even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singerbr br i give it a 210
