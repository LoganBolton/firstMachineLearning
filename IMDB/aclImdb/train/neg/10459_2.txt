disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and directionall in all very obviously an illconceived first effort at commercial filmmaking by the good people at tbnbr br tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring china cry the story of nora lam to the big screen but the omega code is an unfortunate miscue as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved china cry i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone they do much good with their ministry but this isnt an example of it dont waste your moneygo rent china cry instead
