raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real unfortunately there is no reality to this film the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fakebr br the reason bad directing peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal it seems mr sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel wrong it just gives it a badlymade feel similarly shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from whats on screen instead of enhance itbr br of course whats on screen is so painfully fake as if mr sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look hip to his sundance buddies and show how edgy a filmmaker he isbr br overall the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr sollett is next time how about taking a few writing and directing classes
