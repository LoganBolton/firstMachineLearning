i truly wish i was not writing this review im a christian so i waited anxiously to see this movie it seemed great  a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that i buy the bible code itself  you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so im sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes im sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked  some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special im not counting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work  fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour i couldve gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater  like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was  but im not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didnt have either im sorry but i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone and thats the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere
