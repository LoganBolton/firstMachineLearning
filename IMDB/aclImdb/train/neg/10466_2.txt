the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he cant decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliabilityfor example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lanes family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van diengillen lane is only in his twentiesor thats the impression that i hadand has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbns family values also why did this film have to be so damn propagandalike ill repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesnt do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guys omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominicironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film ill give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible ive already went on about lanes familybr br  now that im over the acting ill get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and welldone also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that its not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelissays their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldnt just secede theyd send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying were not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short
