i am a youth pastors wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didnt get it and i didnt enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world the bible code the torah code and the code in the koran and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door
