i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons for the first half hour its actually pretty decent although the acting isnt any better then that which you would find in a rap video its kinda funny and the production value doesnt seem half bad in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao another recent dominican film which turned out to be much much better than i expected the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic unfortunately i dont think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter and they fing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge space age cgi effects dating to what im guessing would be the 70s but the whole plot just goes down the drain the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations and clever one liners to top it all off and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert it all turns out to be a dream oh my who didnt see that coming oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie well after about an hour into it i start thinking hmmmm something just doesnt seem right about the sound track but what can it be and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95br br when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art perhaps a comedy to match frances amelie or an action flick to match thailands ongbak an animation as akira was to japan a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england or a socioawakening journey as waking life had here in the statesbr br i would give it a 1 but ive seen much worse come out of dr search los jodedores and youll know what im talking about
