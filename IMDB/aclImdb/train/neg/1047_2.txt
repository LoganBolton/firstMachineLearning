someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudogritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some peoplebr br i didnt see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced selfconscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirtybr br sadly it takes a lot more than handholding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant waybr br its a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies with bad cinematography nonexistent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as artbr br its little wonder that films like in the bedroom or about schmidt get such raves i found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent clones like raising victor vargas they are outright brilliant and inspiredbr br a few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are youll get yet another bythenumbers letsshakethecameraaroundfortwohours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrivedbr br is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them
