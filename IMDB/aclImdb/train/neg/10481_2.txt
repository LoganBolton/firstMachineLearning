the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names ie jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay br br in a positive note kim bassingers and pat moritas performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid br br jason vanness
