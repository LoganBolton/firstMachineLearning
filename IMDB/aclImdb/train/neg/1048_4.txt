raising victor vargas a reviewbr br you know raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big steaming bowl of oatmeal its warm and gooey but youre not sure if it feels right try as i might no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didnt quite feel right victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the directors part apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof he was right but it didnt fool me raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeenyear old boy called you guessed it victor vargas victor rasuk who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years theyve toured the movie starts off in ugly fat donnas bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his bestfriend harold kevin rivera comesalooking for him caught in the attempt by harold and his sister victor vargas runs off for damage control yet even with the embarrassing implication that hes been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat on a hot new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victors eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy judy marte whos not just pretty but a strong and independent too the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film the story also focuses on victors family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita altagracia guzman his brother nino also played by real life brother to victor silvestre rasuk and his sister vicky krystal rodriguez the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimpdaddy his feelings for judy and his grandmothers conservative catholic upbringingbr br the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few but glaring errors throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky nino grandma judy and even judys best friend melonie the problem is we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood we know that he knows how to lick his lips and comb his fro and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack but thats all we know that nino plays piano and quiet well you could see it by the awards on the family piano we know his sister nicki is a gossiploving girl with an invested interest in watching tv we know that grandma is a hardworking traditional latina woman whos trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption yet where is the titular character victor vargas hes in this movie somewhere but we only know what the movie tells us this is by far the films biggest flaw victor vargas isnt so much a character but a pingpong ball bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother but we never get to know who victor vargas really is this is important because as ive mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that hes a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan hes a total alphamale victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all why should anyone so by the end of the movie in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways how could such a twodimensional character have any depth if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect handheld shotbr br raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino innercity neighborhood to the big screen something that few films have done before in the past the film has been complimented for feeling so real and i wontbr br argue with that i havent seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor seriously although the movie has some nice shots of the city the writerdirector peter sollett was way too dependent on closeups and handheld shots this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deepbreathing exercises to keep from passing out as the film continues the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen you can practically smell victor vargass cheap cologne the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast the indoor scenes of innercity apartments make them look small and cramp which is not true ive been in those type apartments i used to live in one theyre not splendorous but they have high ceilings and theyre decent living spaces by the movies standards youd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brickandmortar chipped paint and cracked walls unfortunately solletts constant use of closeups and one particularly bad shot with a zoomin on one scene come off as totally amateurish but raising victor vargas is only solletts second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films one review i read summarized the movie as ethnicity for ethnicitys sake and i cannot agree more if victor vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters applicability wouldnt matter whether they were latino chinese etc yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middleclass suburbia with a bunch of teenybopper white kids the results wouldnt be such glowing reviews and wed see the films flaws more clearly indeed some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question for example victor nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe any selfrespecting latino family wouldnt have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteenyear old girl at first i was unsure perhaps i was wrong but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified considering how conservative the grandmother is youd think that vicky would have been sleeping in her roombr br as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household raised by my grandmother while my mother was working fulltime i could relate to the movie in many ways which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie unfortunately my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film maybe its because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen maybe its because without any further introspection by the film victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hotblooded latino wholl just end up shouting to girls from his car hey baybee ju want to get into my luv mahcheen either way i dont like him so ultimately how can i like a film about him so if youll excuse me im going to go stick my hands into a bowl of gritsbr br
