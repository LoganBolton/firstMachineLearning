on steve irwins show hes hillarious he doesnt even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasnt even what i would call a moviei mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him hes just saying oh this is one nasty bloke and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldnt you expect him to be dead and terri had the worst acting id ever seen like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says steve she didnt sound scared or anything it was just steve i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid
