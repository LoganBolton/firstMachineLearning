i caught this at a test screening all i can say is whatthehell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface its bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isnt even funnybr br the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop thembr br thats about all the story there is the rest is overthetop lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes thats right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film
