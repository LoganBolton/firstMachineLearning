ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans nowthis movie wasnt a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal seekerspecialist millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost nonexistent casting was horrible the acting wasnt even worth elementary schoollevel actors the direction must be faulted as well if you cant get a halfway decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for 3 150 for me 150 for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldnt want to be remembered for this movie respect him avoid this movie
