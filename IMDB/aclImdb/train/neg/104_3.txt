en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitchhiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the womans husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed onbr br the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologyÂ—a nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and thats not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the taletelling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary theres a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars beliefbr br to be fair some of sykes creative camerawork is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castros cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles aint a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of zgrade trashbr br i give the zombie chronicles 210 but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didnt get to view the film with the benefit of 3d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldnt have made that much of a difference
