i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve irwins death from a stingray attack in 2006 it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in 2002 but i didnt hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently its supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isnt very funny at allbr br a us satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt and are unaware of whats inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon the agents are assisted by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terris mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for poachers br br not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i dont think i found anything even mildly amusing its also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as brozzie drewitt played by magda szubanski is supposed to be shes not at one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a major clich√© in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didnt helpbr br steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side youre on the crocodile hunter collision course is not a well crafted movie im sure it does help if youre a big steve irwin fan but even if you are theres no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly havent been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it wont help like i said theres no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes
