some people say steve irwins larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act watch this film its obvious he cant actbr br steve irwin dangerman star of the small screen in his crocodile hunter diaries croc files and eponymous crocodile hunter series you see a naming trend here or is it just me rockets his largerthanstrife persona to the big screen with crocodile hunter collision course yup  theres a definite trend of words beginning with c  basically an episode of crocodile hunter mashed together with a bmoviebr br on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer magda szubanski steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies lachy hulme and kenneth ransom out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed will it hurt my credibility to say theyre on a collision course with wackiness what credibility  ed notebr br the plot is irrelevant as it is steves animal magnetism that propels the film if you find his persona trying the film is a failure but if youre a fan of either him as a businessman conservationist or just plain assklown or his television shows expect more of the same on a widescreen budgetbr br john stainton faithful liege best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter oeuvre can it be called that with a straight face writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jesterbr br the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks and terri steves spouse of 10 years fiercest ally and closest friend treat it like it is one of their documentaries breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera whilst all the other characters behave as if theyre in a bad movie well it wouldnt be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly threaten steves life we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesnt at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting crisp audio and seven action angles br br while terri is unfairly painted as steves mildly incompetent sidekick her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pearshapedbuttockhugging jeans  for the last im not complaining steve goes about his businessasusual of showandtell with creatures intent on killing him doing all his stunts himself because well to him theyre not really stunts just a day at the office br br of course watching this madmans kookoo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings but to those of us who never met him this kind of malarkey as well as various incarnations of the crocodile hunter series in constant reruns keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints br br so enjoy this diversion for what it is  a halfbaked movie featuring a fullon legend he died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife  and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just thatbr br movie maniacs visit poffysmoviemaniacom
