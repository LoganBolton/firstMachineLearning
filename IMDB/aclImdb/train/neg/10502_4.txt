the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters the different story lines dont feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at timesbr br it may sound weak and clich√© but its true youre way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin its more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is im sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesnt give us the viewers much pleasure for a comedy it simply isnt funny enough and steve and terri irwin just arent good actors not even when they play themselves their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scenes feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at timesbr br the movie had quite some potential i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when i first heard that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter my first reaction was brilliant the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters the movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still i must certainly wouldnt recommend this moviebr br watching this movie felt like a waste of time still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on tv on a rainy afternoon it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potentialbr br 410
