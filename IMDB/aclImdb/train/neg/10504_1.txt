i couldnt watch more than 14 minutes of it its a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing the shots used are disgusting they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time my head hurts try to watch that load of you know what dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windowsannoying what else its so badly framed all the time its just make you want to scream at that lady directing there i only directed short films but im pretty sure id be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that its gonna be pretty awful so pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost itll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental and that 1h30 hour of your life youll never get back
