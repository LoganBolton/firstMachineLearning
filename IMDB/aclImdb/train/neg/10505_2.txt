if you liked blair with youll like this one it has the same lousy camerawork and soundtrack and it has the same nonexistent plot and suspenseful momentsbr br it also has tom savini so if you like romeros dawn of the dead or tarantino and rodriguez from dusk till dawn youre in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as wellbr br no seriously this movie is definitely the lousiest movie ive seen in a long time and ive seen quite a few movies  bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of timebr br the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharplooking plastic teeth no im just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote formbr br stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover
