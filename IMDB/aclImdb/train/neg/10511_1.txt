note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie thats so worthless its insultingbr br i watched this becausebr br the premise sounded slightly promising its not its just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other lowbudget slasher films that werent good either br br the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful its not its so not the amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless personbr br the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre hes the king of lowbudget special effects and lowerbudget acting come to think of it savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie its not that hes bad but hes almost always in bad movies his only good role was in from dusk till dawn and hes been milking that at horror conventions ever sincebr br but lets focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie br br everything else is a negative obviously the writer is allergic to originality the script is terrible thats all a given after the first 10 minutes but the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in generalbr br this is another good example of the numberone way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if its written and directed by the same person expect garbage
