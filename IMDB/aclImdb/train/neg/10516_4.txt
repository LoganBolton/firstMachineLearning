forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother  sister emilio richard cambridge  ally sophie holland along with judd daniel maclagan molly nicole petty  andrew david hood set off on a week long holiday in the middle of nowhere their words not mine anyway before they know it theyre deep in a forest  emilio clumsily runs over a woman frances da costa along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van theyre travelling in wont start  they cant get any signals on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly  judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by  darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone  that there is something nasty lurking in the woodsbr br this english production was written  directed by johannes roberts  having looked over several other comments  reviews both here on the imdb  across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it  others not personally it didnt do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with additional screenplay material whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest  kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then theres stephen played by the ever fantastic tom savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like a proper film the characters are poor the dialogue not much better  the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything thats going on having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace  there are a couple of decent scenes herebr br director johannes doesnt do anything special its not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at theres a few decent horror scenes  the tom savini character is great whenever hes on screen although why didnt he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly  its a shame when he gets killed off there are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in theres a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off  someone is ripped in half there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps muchbr br technically forest of the damned is ok its reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eyecatching this was shot in england  wales  its quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end  proves he should stick to writing rather than actingbr br forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe im missing something but its not a film i have much fondness for apart from one or two decent moments theres not much here to recommend
