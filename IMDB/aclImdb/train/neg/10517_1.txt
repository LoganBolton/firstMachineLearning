from the start this film was awful why was it that bad if it isnt the naked women not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening then its the crazy old guy at the gas station who isnt so much crazy but more im not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis apparently without touching youand this is according to the opening scene they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up then you have sophie holland who plays ally i have never seen such baaaaaad acting she is more of a me me me if im not having fun noone else is and i dont wanna do this so i wont and im the meanest cow on the planet im sarcastic petty and if i dont get things my way i will sulk kind of person reminds me more of a 6 yr old girls attitude i dont think its even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch or how lowbudget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the locked door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side this film is completely laughable if it were a spoof then it would have been successfulonly just though but as a horror film is was just plain wrong i cant even being to describe everything that went tts up in this movie i would run out of room although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savinis character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow so is it any wonder they dont get away with it and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened no pain no weakening from blood loss nothing but the silliest part is when all of a sudden and i mean that literally its one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs and then lo and behold shaun hutson picks her upof course not without a line to promote his books altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors but suddenly and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why shes evil herself and lures hutson to his death then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can even after his dazzling performance on why noone should ever venture there for whatever reasoncue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhereand here endeth the filmfinally my conclusionif you hadnt already guessed by nowabsolute rubbish there was no proper thought went into it at all whoever was aiming the camera needed firingand come to think of it so did 99 of the cast if the right director actors and budget got behind this it could have been decent but once again lowbudget english horror films but the rest of the genre the country and the english filmmaking industry to shame and im english so im allowed to say that in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 1520 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area all i kept thinking throughout this was jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this its absolute cows testicles but i cant turn a film off after ive started watching it unfortunately i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well if there was an option for 010 then believe me i woulda chose that cuz this film isnt even worth the one point i did give it br br but this is just my opinion watch it and decide for yourself
