this film actually works from a fairly original idea  ive never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway however the way that it executes this idea isnt original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecksnutcaseszombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme many films of this ilk dont have a single good idea  and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that theyre beautiful women that the characters lust for rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring and the almost complete lack of any backstory surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the horror trash categorybr br its been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting this is one of the films major assets as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown  the only problem is that forest of the damned doesnt ever seem to have much up its sleeve the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are clich√©d in the extreme doesnt help as youre more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away the cast is made up of kids mainly but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortunately doesnt get to have fun in the special effects department the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves the naked ladies tend to look great and if it wasnt for them this film would get very boring very quickly theres nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks you might find some enjoyment here
