for the first forty minutes empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick at the time i didnt know why i thought it was good but now i do br br one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful i dont mind films with psychos and things to prove a point take jackie brown for example but theyre all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach another major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrogant yet ironically enough not that bad he doesnt seem tight enough to be a drugdealing woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs br br  out of  1 out of 5
