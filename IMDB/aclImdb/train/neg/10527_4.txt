i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oops and this one surely is an oop one year after the exorcist shes back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out she never became a mega star thats one of the reasons many of her films are oop she gives a good performance in this movie its about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesnt have any friends played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 thats funny the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity in most editions its cut out why i dont know no blood is involved okay blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no ta so nothing to offend people but the movie is slow extremely slow it doesnt happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep its just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me if youre a fan of blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is
