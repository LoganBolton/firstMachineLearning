1st watched 1262009  4 out of 10 dirwalter lang disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this muchheralded rodgers and hammerstein piece there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the king of siam by yul brynner  but the movie doesnt really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we dont fully understand the characters and their situations i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing but even this part didnt stand out a lot for me the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil there is a side forbidden romance between the kings newest wife played by rita morenoa latino as an arabcome on and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though deborah kerr as the main female character annie  is ok but not that convincing either the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really
