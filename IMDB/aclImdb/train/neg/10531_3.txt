this is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you dont if you do youll love this personally i prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers and eleanor powell bill robinson ruby keeler james cagney shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the 50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me offbr br this film is a caseinpoint the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me by then the story didnt have much appeal either the presence of deborah kerr is another minus i dont think ive seen a movie she starred in that i liked including this one where the goody twoshoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam i which she had br br however divorcing myself from likesanddislikes there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked the sound of music a decade later there are similarities in the rh musicals thus if you liked the julie andrews flick you should like this too br br this is a lavish production with yes a capital l this is the kind of bigproduction musicals you rarely saw after that generation you also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isnt able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr as she did with natalie wood in west side story and audrey hepburn in my fair lady br br yul brynner is king mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way he isnt progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher kerr as anna leonowens will set him straight secularprogressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer however yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his morebarkthanbite character justifiably he is the big star of this film brynner had magnetism even in the magnificent seven yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audiencebr br in summary its a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it ill leave it at that
