madison is not too badif you like simplistic nonoffensive familyfriendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing if like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson muncey cantrell slovak etc prepare to be disappointedbr br professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book i neednt repeat what theyve said what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in 1971br br yes it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed but where was the sound much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mindnumbing roar of six allison or rollsmerlin aircraft engines wound up to rpms never imagined by their designers hitting the starting line right in front of you you didnt hear it you felt it real hydro buffs know exactly what im talking about theres none of that in madison instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical scorebr br and then there are the closeup shots of the drivers riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor hometown hero or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a rocky salute from a bridge pier in reality some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rockhard water at speeds above 150 mphbr br as one reviewer so aptly put it the sport deserves better than thisbr br finally since another user brought up anachronisms ill add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field neither existed in 1971
