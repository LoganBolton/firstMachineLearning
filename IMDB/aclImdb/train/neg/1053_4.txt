bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil stepmother performancebr br visually stunning in some parts but thats about it the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivelbr br if youre really in the mood for a cinderella story  i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper
