when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie its touch and go whether you should revisit it anyway i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff koberbr br the first power is not a very good movie sad to say its chock full of those cop clich√©s and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along lou diamond phillips is the overconfident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the casebr br ahhh this is trash but enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good as for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70s demonic flick and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here needless to say hes not convincing at all but he tries his best and ive never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have as for tracy griffith as the psychic the less said the better but kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actorbr br the first power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard days work and a brain switchoff is needed beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and ill definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin all in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids see you around buddy boy
