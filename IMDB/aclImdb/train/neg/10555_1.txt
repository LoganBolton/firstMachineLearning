first of all i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zerobudgetflick is none of it the picturequality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever heard and as for the fx well the superlow quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie what this junk here isnt no concept a waferthin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog  i think i counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times same for a lot of filmsequences may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring performing a show of selfmutilation so far so good but for these pseudoartidiotdirectors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense freshly takenout bowels are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earthhole why and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody movie disturbing yes sick yes necessary no artistically no everyone mistaking this cheap goreshow for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyds the wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way i hope this was your first and last  movie andrew cobb  and all you goreheads out there remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically art
