this is a good example of how not to make a filmbr br there is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes the result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the directors commentarybr br this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse it includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions although it works in the context of the movie i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minorsbr br the climax is anticlimactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie if youre not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss itbr br the directors commentary was a oneshot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary while this isnt necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the moviebr br the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget because of this the video and audio quality is poor that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse
