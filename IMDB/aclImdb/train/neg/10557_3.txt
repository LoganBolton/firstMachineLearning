its a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches its an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stopmotion animation its weird but its not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect its the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and cosgrovehall did far more attractive things with stopmotionbr br interestingly this is a french production as such it reenforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary
