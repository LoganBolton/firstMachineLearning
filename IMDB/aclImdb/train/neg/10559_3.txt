i dont understand none of this makes any sense exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie i know exactly how he feels the story by the films director aristide massacessi good old joe damato using his real name for a change is a clumsy mix of the supernatural murdermystery and pretentious arty rubbish the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess francos more bizarre efforts but which had me struggling to remain consciousbr br opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister with whom he had been having an incestuous affair before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman played by ewa aulin who stars in the equally strange death laid an egg is seen alive and kicking the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrück after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home where she is tended to by creepy dr sturges klaus kinski in a throwaway role the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr and mrs ravensbrück meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovinbr br so far so good i thought to myself at this point weve had hunchbacks incest some blood and guts and gratuitous female nudityall ingredients of a great trashy eurohorror what follows however is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings ghostly goings on and even elements from edgar allan poes the black cat to tell a very silly utterly bewildering and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the gravebr br this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb but given the choice i would much rather watch one of the directors sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible meandering surreal 70s gothic horror just aint my thing 25 out of 10 purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness rounded up to 3 for imdb
