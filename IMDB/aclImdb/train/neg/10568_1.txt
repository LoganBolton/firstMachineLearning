wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake its the worst movie ive seen in the past decade  no exaggerationbr br as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories  far from it  but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the tiniest little shred it seemed like it had been written by an 8 yearold child who got all his notions of war and soldierly behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in honduras which should have been a clue but even that cant fully explain the atrocious production values of this clichéridden piece of trashbr br i could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the characters name tags like colcollins worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the reversed mirrorimage n of the russian alphabet not the us alphabet the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves  every single scene was just chockfull of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichésbr br neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to prepubescent boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurdbr br in short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all its a total waste of time id strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by its truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for
