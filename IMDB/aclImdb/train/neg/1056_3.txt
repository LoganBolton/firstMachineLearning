diana guzman is an angry young woman surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas she takes her anger out on the closest targetsbr br when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club she knows shes found her home br br the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual comingofage lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexismbr br the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which detracts from the dramatic tension the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity br br this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category
