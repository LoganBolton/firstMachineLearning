horror fans im speaking to the over 12s although if youre under 12 i apologise for what you might deem an insult in short if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written original storytelling punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares and delivered via convincing performances then i can heartily recommend  avoiding these steamers  made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date its no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980s not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys or indeed the 80s because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento carpenter landis dante and barker actually clive wtf are you doing in there glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as im sure he was asked to partake more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly illadvised tv remake of stanley kubricks masterpiece the shiningbr br perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets sadly maybe sobr br normally i wouldnt see the point of adding a comment that doesnt argue the faults and merits of a production id just rate it accordingly however as this series is woefully lacking in any merit with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune i write this as more of a warning than a review dont waste your time and money if you disagree with me then its more than likely that you havent seen enough decent horror perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start but if these masters of horror were being assessed on these works alone theyd never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelors degree unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of st
