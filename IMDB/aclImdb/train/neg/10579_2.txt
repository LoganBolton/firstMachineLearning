according to imdb takashi miikes master of horrorsegment imprint was banned in the us so i figured id translate the swedish review i just wrote for itbr br it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killerdirector takashi miikes episode in the masters of horror series and the dvdcover of imprint did in deed look very promisingbr br the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello some time during the 19th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey it turns out that one of the prostitutes a deformed and quiet girl know about komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallowbr br the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent americanenglish but i will leave it at that its not that big a deal what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was miikes tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldnt help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes the extended torurescene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so unmotivated  and pornographically intrusive  that not even that scene became interesting i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself  with no sense of style or purpose the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing waterand in all honesty the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgustbr br the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago for me most memorable as frank nitti  al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables 1987 ive always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy and i mean that in a good way and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible not in a good way in this one his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago im grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh memoirs of a geisha 2005 who plays the deformed prostitutebr br the finale is probably supposed to be chocking maybe even revolting and horrid but i just found it to be kind ofyou know blah and i looked at my watch again for the umptieth time just wishing the crappy episode would end maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit but thats only because i couldnt help thinking of an episode of red dwarf and the upsidedown chins of craig charles and danny johnjules with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens lucky you if youve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for youbr br my first thought when imprint finally ended was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series and that  if anything  is a big friggin warning dont you thinkbr br one might point to the costume design by michiko kitamura and say that there at least is something not lacking in style and refinementbut there are so many other films and tvshows that is so much better at showing off the japanese geishafashion this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed takashi miikes masters of horrorepisode is boring uninspiring and pointless in other words its really really bad
