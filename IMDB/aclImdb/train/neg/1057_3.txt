im sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningfulbr br so dont buy a large drink or youll be running to the rest room my kids didnt enjoy it either ah well
