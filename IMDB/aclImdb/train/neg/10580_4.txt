i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depps in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete ripoff but i guess tv budgets dont always stretch to this kind of acting abilitybr br i also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasnt done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story  well i was disappointed there as well there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anticlimactic to say the leastbr br this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premisebr br i took the dvd back to the store the same day
