at first i was convinced that this was a madefortv movie that wasnt worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumbstruck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the overthetop stunts and cmovie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadnt laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a lessfunny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with evenworse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and highfives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier
