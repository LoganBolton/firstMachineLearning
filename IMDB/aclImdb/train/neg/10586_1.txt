this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles fergusona former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen br br the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazisand that is what this film feels likean apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself br br ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run betteras if any war can be better
