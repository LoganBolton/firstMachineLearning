we open with colonel luc deveraux van damme the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers they almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond mebr br its after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going the united states government has cut the universal soldiers project budget and in the process angered seth the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers naturally he wont be shut down without a fight so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel but that doesnt stop it from becoming stupid as hell br br for instance one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg seems you cant go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie hes big hes tough right wrong van damme doesnt seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him once  twice  three times the point here lost on me then theres the breaking of glass a rudimentary part of any action movie but someone involved must have a glass fetish you have to see the fight scenes in particular lets not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck they have seth the computer secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black michael jai white nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem potentially offensive and just downright lame hes no replacement for dolph eitherbr br universal soldier 2 is a lousy sequel its loud its dumb and it doesnt care the original wasnt anything poetic but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level the sequel doesnt they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence so give credit where credit is due
