ill be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that its in the imdb bottom 100 and right now im wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another check on that same listbr br van damme is luc deveraux who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a hal to defend itself and yes after all the obligate explosions shootouts and chases he is the last one standing combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring setup it makes sure its place in the infamous list is justbr br only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list 210
