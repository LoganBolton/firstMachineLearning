this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jeanclaud vam damme stars in this moviethere are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the moviebr br the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at alland this movie by far has to be one of jeanclaud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sportkickboxer or sudden deathbr br over all this movie is crapok and my rating is 4 out of 10
