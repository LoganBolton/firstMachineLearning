after seeing the lowbudget shittier versions of the universal soldier franchise i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie well it seemed this prayer was answered but not the way i hoped universial soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library no even that would be more intriguing  the fight sequences are topnotch bruce lee quality which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture that and having former wcw toughguy legend goldberg playing the villain however placing goldberg as seths sidekick lieutenant wouldve been betterbr br we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself its like some film school students slapped it together the plot holes are that bigger than kanye wests ego is what really did this movie in for example lucs daughter hillary looks like shes at least 1113 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago how is that possible tell me that the part in which lucs partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just regoddamn diculous you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie cmon the director couldve spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut but oooh nooo br br speaking of the plot it sucks compared to the first movie universal soldier 2s plot watered down and worthless wheres the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an reenacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something  this was the dawn of the millennium you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopiaorwellian type of future cesspit corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad sad sad sequel br br from what i seen double impact under siege 2 robocop 3 and hell even the cheapassno class terminator knockoff class of 1999 is more entertaining than this
