i dont think any movie of van dammes will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as 1st vd returns a luc  must do battle again he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle vd has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a pic of them 2 goldberg was cool he does his famous moveforgot what its called cause i dont watch wrestlingsucks vd  goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good vd does his best move in his career like alwaysthe helicopter kick even though the final ending shouldve been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original
