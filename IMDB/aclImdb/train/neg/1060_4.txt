ok so it was written in 1996 before 911 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient thats it thats the good stuff the actingfair the plotsilly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isnt to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic im a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didnt have to watch all the ads that was a plus its a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
