terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever and as for the feminist polemic its laughable i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief im glad i did go to see it thats because i now have an immediate answer to the question whats the worst film youve ever seen plus i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world as is revealed in the closing creditsbr br i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public so why shouldnt she think she could get away with the selfindulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson
