this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash its one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally potters disgustingly obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing its absolutely unreal
