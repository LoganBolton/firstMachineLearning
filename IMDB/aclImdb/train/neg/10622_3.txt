i actually have a fondness for christopher lee but this just wasnt up to his other performances and he was one of the better actorsbr br the film does not live up to its premise its not that scary its overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite arrivedbr br the evil ones arent at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in depthbr br perhaps if id been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some mstiefication at this films expense but naaahhh didnt really seem to be worth the effort it wasnt really very good it wasnt really very bad it was just mediocre
