the only reason i didnt score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically adept filmbr br that having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact and sibrels irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanicsbr br i do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free dont let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity
