ouch this one was a bit painful to sit through it has a cute and amusing premise but it all goes to hell from there matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and he does not disappoint in this one deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances alan bates and jennifer tilly among others played it way over the top i know thats the way the parts were written and its hard to blame actors when the script and director have them do such schlock if youre going to have outrageous characters thats ok but you gotta have good material to make it work it didnt here run away screaming from this movie if at all possible
