there are so many incorrect statements in this socalled documentary that i found myself shouting at the televisionbr br bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claimsbr br he relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claimsbr br whats more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sitesbr br further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinionsbr br all of the claims made by mr sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disprovenbr br how do i get that 40odd minutes of my life back
