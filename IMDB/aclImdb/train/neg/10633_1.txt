i watched this video at a friends house im glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blowups most not related to manned flight sibrels smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voiceover instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
