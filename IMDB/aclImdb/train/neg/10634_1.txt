writerdirector bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished filmbr br unfortunately sibrels research is so slipshod that he doesnt realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the 30minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footagebr br finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrels hackedup version of it he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfks assassination than of his smoking gun sibrel thinks hes the only one whos seen it whats more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earthbr br as with most films of this type sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence
