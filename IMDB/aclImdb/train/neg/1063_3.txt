the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some 34 brilliant stories but these were out of 18 the frame reminded me of all the invisible children  a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je taime lacks the intriguing short story which develops  starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those  children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches togetherperhaps for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldnt recommend it
