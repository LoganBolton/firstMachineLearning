usually im a bit of a fan of the bad eighties  early nineties film featuring now has beensbut this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death  but never so pathetically corey haims performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actoractress in this piece of trash  stay away
