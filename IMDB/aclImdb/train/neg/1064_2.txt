be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherencebr br the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different waysbr br each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didnt work out because you didnt get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just sillybr br this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i dont know and i dont care
