this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie ive ever seen and thats saying a lot considering ive seen such stinkers like demon of paradise lovers lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out at times theres nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of womens areas shrink wrapped in spandex the policeman was the most stonefaced monotone actor ive ever seen the bestworst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin what were they thinking whos the killer a disgruntled huggies employee id have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if i didnt have a blast watching it
