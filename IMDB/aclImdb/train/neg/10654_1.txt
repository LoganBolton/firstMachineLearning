big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pinthese are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and ive seen hundredsbut this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughablethe best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer isits just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut teeshirts that show off their stomachssickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over againin almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodiesand the gym still doesnt close for bereavement all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
