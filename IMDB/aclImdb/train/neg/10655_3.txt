this is quite possibly the most retarded 80s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features nonstop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other bodystimulating fitness products if youd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young healthfreaks with a big safety pin yeah the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sunbathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same spa you dont really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out theres a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and charles napier lookalike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80s beauty ive ever seen looking through the credits her names dianne copeland apparently and she didnt do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile tromamovie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the makeup effects are nothing special neither were treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway aerobicide aka killer workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific doublefeature with death spa both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb
