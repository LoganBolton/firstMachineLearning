filmatography excellent nice camera angles i dont remember seeing a movie of late with good closeups until this one could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera ny is pictured goodi liked the upside down angles in particular a different touchbr br music not impressive songs dont stick around in your mind even after watching the movie may be i expected same quality like anniyan a disappointment br br actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hardcore action sequences his age and belly really show up also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward it was a very awkward to see a matureaged star still trying to play like a 20 heroes scenes love can be expressed at any age as we get older you still can express love nicely from a distance without touching a woman too much for example the love expressed by rajinikanth in chandrmukhibr br jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie not sure why she accepted this well that is not my problem i guessbr br others just have a small presencebr br direction i expected gautham to excel or measureup to his other movie kakka kakka he disappointmented me it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues he slips in few scenes even abvious things got slipped from a famous directorbr br overall just a okay movie too much graphics definitely not for kids and adults who expect some kind of entertainmentbr br thx
