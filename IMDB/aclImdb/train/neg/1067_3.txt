only a handful of the segments are engaging here a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking one with fanny ardent  bob hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things br br the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris the others are so scattershot in theme tone volition  production that you may as well be watching the years best commercials 2006 its really all over the place it doesnt develop over its running time and nothing reigns the directors in no construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in im at the one hour twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb overcommercial overproduced vampire shtick it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment uh thanks j  e for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances the point of being in paris is that you dont need makebelieve crap to make your days extraordinary why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director has there ever been a genre more overrepresented than the vampire film every three years we get the same lame vampire clich√©sbr br making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless the transitions get lost this doesnt feel intentional it feels sloppy
