so im looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called end game it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller well worth a look then or so i thoughtbr br boy was i wrongbr br end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring now being something of a whodunnit i cant really tear into it as i would like without ruining it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity but questions such as why has heshethey done this and where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off are all too abundant following the films unintentionally hilarious conclusionbr br as for the acting  you know those films where you can almost feel that an actors realised that theyve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie and this then shows in their performance this is one of those accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poisonbr br of course this didnt make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling
