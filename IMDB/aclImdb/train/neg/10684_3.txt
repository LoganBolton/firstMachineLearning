this movie was craptacular i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would automagically transform into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldnt help but notice that cubas acting was as flimsy as tracing paper his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general thats right a general who wears too much makeup i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cubas except mine was real and i stubbed my toe recompense recompense my stubbed toe
