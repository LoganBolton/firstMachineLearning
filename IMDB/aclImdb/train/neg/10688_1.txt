i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldnt believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happenedi was mad because i could have used that time doing something elsei tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained itright or wrong its better than not knowing anything who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that were going to be subjected to end game 2
