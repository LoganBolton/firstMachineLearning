cuba gooding jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the us president ill point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why he teams up with a persistent news reporter angie harmon to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the presidents death and so on blah blah blahbr br even with a cast of james woods cuba gooding jr anne archer and angie harmon end game fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isnt all bad and the story although clich√©d and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie  well it doesnt the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the charactersbr br 410 its boring predictable and dull
