i guess its possible that ive seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching hes capable of good work but failed to pull this movie togetherbr br angie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into whos behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b listbr br and what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what weve come to expect from himbr br poor james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor
