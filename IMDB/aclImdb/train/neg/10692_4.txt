poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood glamor treatment first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress and now its europa 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentimentbr br nor does the story do much for alexander knox in another thankless role as her longsuffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than strombolibr br bergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman shes never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think im going out of my mind she tells her husband a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is goingbr br bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in postwar rome but being a social worker with poor children doesnt improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worsebr br the films overall effect is that its not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that shes twotiming him the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a streetwalker through her terminal illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylumbr br ingrid suffers nobly through it all overcompensating for the loss of her son but its no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildlybr br trivia note if she wanted neorealism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak it would have done more for her career than europa 51br br summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman
