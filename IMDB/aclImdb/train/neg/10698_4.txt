the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f murray abraham was in it spoilers about halfway through fmurray gets zapped because the darkling is some kind of demonlike creature who enjoys living vicariously he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins however part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness thats what the little guy said in his barry white voice which i found both charming and amusing mostly amusing like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen dee plane dee plane bos here eet come dee plane all through the movie dee dwarf actually a robotronic cherub talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice saying things like its ok to be bad you know you want it now youve committed murder youre really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for being evil stores or something it really is hilarious in a sick waybr br anyhow aiden gillen is no f murray abraham and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe or knifed f murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film he is a good actor aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical if this movie were a parody the ending was perfect if it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a grossout that the movie itself could not deliver the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending
