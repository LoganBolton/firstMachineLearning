yes i sat through the whole thing god knows whybr br it was a long afternoon i had nothing to do it was bitterly cold outside okay those are all lame excuses but theyre the only ones i havebr br i gave the darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10  i have seen worse films but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdompoor script poor acting bad lighting and cheesy special effectsbr br the storyline which never completely makes sense revolves around this simple little family daddy mommy and little girlthat i assume the viewer is supposed to be identifying with all three of them were tedious and annoying you just want the dark side to get every one of thembr br daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the mysterious orient rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as the darkling br br during the course of the film the darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things a shadow without a person the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancybecause trust me it doesnt really matterbr br the darklings main problem seems to be that it craves having a companionit gets a human companionand then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being this of course leads to immense wealth followed by disaster for the human who hooks up with the darklingbr br and for the rest of us  it just leads to a very long tedious moviebr br
