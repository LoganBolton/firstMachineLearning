1st watched 832003  2 out of 10dirbrad sykes mindless 3d movie about flesheating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d wow not that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesheating thats what made the original zombie classics good the flesheating was just thrown in as an extra were actually bored throughout most of this 3part chronicle because of the lametwilightzone like easily understood and slowpacingly revealed finales the last story is actually the story the movie started withhaving a reporter investigating a socalled ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombies in that one as well well i think ive said enough watch the classics not this 3d borefeast
