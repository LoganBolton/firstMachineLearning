the film is about sir christopher strong mpmember of parliamentplayed by colin clive and his affair with the amelia earhartlike character played by katherine hepburn up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn he couldnt help himself and they fell in love you can tell because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is frankly this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch part of the problem is that in the precode days films glamorizing adultery were very common plus even if you accept this morally suspect subject the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance noveland a really bad one at that sticky and with difficult to like characters after all clives wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm make this one a big waste of time about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume youve gotta see it to believe itand she looks like one of the bugaloos an obscure but fitting reference
