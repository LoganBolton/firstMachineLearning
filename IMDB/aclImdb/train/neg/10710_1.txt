dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the antichrist is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isnt killed so easily as he transfers from body to body like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren like steven seagal and jeanclaude van damme i try to watch his movies whenever theyre on tv i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed this movie is utterly terrible with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena worst of all is lundgrens woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest  all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie ive seen from dolph lundgren it literally has nothing to recommend it its awful and its the lowest point in lundgrens career and i saw coverup the last warrior and masters of the universebr br 12 out of 4awful
