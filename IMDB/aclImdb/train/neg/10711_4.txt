the minion is about well a minion a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an archeologist is assigned to studydig the place where the key was found needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologistbr br the movie is just that a low budget bmovie flick the movie lacks energy and just trods along youll follow the chase but you wont ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it skillfully becomes a oneman army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to oneon one and its supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience the whole idea of a secret order of templars a door to hell and the key isnt well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling theres not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere elsebr br the verdict 2 of 5 stars
