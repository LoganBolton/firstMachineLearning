i give this a generous four out of ten stars or dots or markers or somethingbr br there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear greg kinnear moved along agreeably enoughbr br otherwise the usual trafficking in stereotypes blazing speed rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack and soundtrack is generous br br anyway the two really really funny scenes involved amy p shes just really hilarious in an animal kind of way shes a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ballbr br i hope they amy p and tina fey just flat out admitted they did this for the money because if by doing it it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies then i guess we can say yeah it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role whos really there to help you be more humanbr br blah 4 outta 10 like i said is generousbr br but no more girls ok oh i almost forgot the mom from two and a half men is in this movie and shes had some kind of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old so every scene shes in im like trying to rearrange her face or put it together in my mind or just answer the question no wait wait has she had plastic surgery because as a viewer you really dont want her to have had plastic surgery
