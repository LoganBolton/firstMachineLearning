i wouldnt say this totally sucked but if it wasnt for netflix i wouldnt even have this in my house steve martins eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat hes just not funny hes another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldnt get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs
