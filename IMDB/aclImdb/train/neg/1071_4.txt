a very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for its creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie personally i cant do that with a drama and found this too farfetchedbr br im particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete imbecile in this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no moviebr br the first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named magruder played by kenneth branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl mallory doss played by embeth davidtz who is screaming that her car has been stolen they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride homebr br she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town they notice that her car is in the driveway also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been brokenbr br things are very odd shes weird looking like a tramp she undresses in front of him until shes completely naked Â… oh yeah also the fathers strange the house is a wreck  everything should have told magruder hey this is too weird for me im out of here but not magruder he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed it all screams setupbr br then being the topflight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16yearold magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is terrorising them the police ignore him i could have believed begrudging assistance but no help at all  not likelybr br its just too unlikely
