the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy one by one the blood is drained from those involved in the digbr br to be as brief as possible pharaohs curse is quite the lackluster affair while the movie does present a few good original ideas blood sucking mummys soul transference interesting makeup effects the arm ripping scene etc and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding to make matters even worse the first 15 of the films relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but pharaohs curse tests even my patients the cast helps very little with only one exception ziva rodann is the lone bright spot Â– wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character the cast is as dull as the screenplay finally i dont know whose idea it was to put the mummylooking servant in what appears to be pajamas but its a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audiencebr br despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaohs curse im going to rate it a 410 not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems i have with the movie
