as much as i dislike saying me too in response to other comments  its completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90br br having been banned somewhere doesnt make a film watchable just because it doesnt resemble a hollywood product does not make it crediblebr br worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating im in to my second package of rolaidsbr br as for spoilers  well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldnt write one if i triedbr br dont waste your time or money and dont confuse this with good russian cinema
