i agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and gets you wandering about what is to come which is nothing all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for 1 or 2 very short scenes i wander if ilya wouldnt have done better to just completely leave them out as for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either she just visits some godawful place and suddenly the movie isnt about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the iffr but for me it is just bad taste bad camerawork a lousy script and frightfully bad direction therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 1
