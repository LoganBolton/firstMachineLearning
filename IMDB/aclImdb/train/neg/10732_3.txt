the russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girlbr br 4 i gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in postsoviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes  operating secret cloning facilities selling decadesold frozen meat etc  but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybodys really up to herebr br despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes 4 is a twohour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs
