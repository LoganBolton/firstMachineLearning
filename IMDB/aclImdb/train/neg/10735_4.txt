perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the arthousefestival crap trashcan its not the greatest film of 2005 nor is it complete garbage it just has a lot of problems i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ideological fears or conservative taboos or any other reason this movie might conversely be called courageous and uncompromising abroad it was banned because the censors knew 99 of the russian filmgoers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull filmbr br so we have a strong opening shot wonderful sound design excellent premise  laden with meaning and symbolism the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the films strongest aspects not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup an amusing and wellwritten bar conversation among the 3 main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of russia the human condition and all that then the movie starts slowing down we begin to wonder what yawn lies aheadbr br the rest is quite boring simply put sure the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings and there are some slightly amusing moments nice sound sure but the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously compromised by the pacing problems and this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicelyshot abject misery and bleakness is what ultimately will make people angry at the offensive stuff personally the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appearbr br if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch particulars of the national hunt much more rewarding postsoviet stuff so yeah a 4 out of 10 for 4 nice and symbolic of my postmediocrefilm condition
