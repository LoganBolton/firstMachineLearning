i cant believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories ive ever wasted my time on its just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branaghs character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grishammovie ever and this isnt changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie dont waste your time here
