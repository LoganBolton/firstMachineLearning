who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordons legendary bad trashfilm food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80s location a university campus and also the cheap  cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80s this script hangs together by clichés awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielbergs jaws started theres an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods 2 is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growthserum i wonder what freuds theory would be on that theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest 70s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the 2003 willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts
