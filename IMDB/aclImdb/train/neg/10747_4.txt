camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot this time theyve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wildernessbr br this time around theres a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants this is hardly a new idea ive seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knifebr br unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs i liked how theres a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantombr br i dont know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for 5 just like they did in the second movie they still havent worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well its a camp blood movie what do you expect if you like crap films youll get some fun out of this one
