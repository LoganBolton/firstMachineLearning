i should never have started this film and stopped watching after 34s i missed the really botched ending this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better it had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations but a baaaaaad story line a bad script i paid attention to kenneth branaghs southern accentit was better than the script the plot was stupiddriven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts
