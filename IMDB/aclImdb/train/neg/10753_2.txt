del  you are the dumbest smart person ive ever metbr br calvin welli had a brain but they lost it in the rewritesbr br i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimovs work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here shes just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil smithbr br there are passing references to asimovs laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenesbr br smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isnt that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do
