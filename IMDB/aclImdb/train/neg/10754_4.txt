waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand i expected an interesting scifi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robottechnology instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects cant help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year acting in this movie also dissatisfied me will smith didnt show anything new in this movie yet i never saw his acting to change since men in black which was his only success by my opinion he had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like irobot and men in black 2 410
