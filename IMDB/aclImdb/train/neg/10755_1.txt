i cant really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plotholes this wasnt only laughable and but painful to watch even the action was boring a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small childrenbr br what a shame that scifi this bad can still be made after weve had bladerunner minority report or to a lesser extent dark city by the same director this one really belongs in the bottom 100 list truly awful
