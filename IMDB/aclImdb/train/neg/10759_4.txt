in spite of the great futuredesign touches the clever asimov premise and will smiths dependable cool performance this movie doesnt live up to expectations the clich√©s come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it  you can see the end a mile off this movie is also stagebound  you never feel that you have travelled anywhere whats supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago the robots themselves are good in closeup but the crowd scenes look more like bad disney the cgi is overdone again and again and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject nanites you know its a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax it could have been great but its less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years
