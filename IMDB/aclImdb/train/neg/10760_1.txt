this film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flippingjumpingsomersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well its just been invented by i robotbr br what happened to practicality ie the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shopbr br what happened to showing respect for women ie smiths character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension ill tell you where good looks and not admiration or common groundbr br what happened to a detective that detects smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point bcdetc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the im snoring and not listening to you joke twice in one scenebr br what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes shia labeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that ahe degrades women and bhe knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harmbr br what happened to heros lets just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on footbr br dont get me wrong im all for spectacle but im also all for a shred of realism and meaningbr br i have to say ive never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex br br i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniquesbr br big budget action films you so have to die
