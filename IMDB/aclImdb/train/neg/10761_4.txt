this movie was a mess it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dreambr br under the messy direction and editing there was a glimmer of something good a good idea a compelling spark but somewhere it went wrongbr br the story is about a quasipsychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest well the part doesnt call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy he always plays the crazy bad guy very ho humbr br oh a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character grieco was experiencing and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords not a good sign for any moviebr br
