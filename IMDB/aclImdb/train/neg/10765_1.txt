a splendid example of how hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it upbr br in the case of the big sky writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prizewinning author ab guthrie in so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptationbr br the epic nature of guthries book and the evolution of its main character boone caudill from a naive kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivormountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the authors intent in the movie version boones presence is nothing except underwhelmingbr br intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthries novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages on the other hand a very important and fascinating character dick summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie played by actor hunnicutt wasnt irritating enough so zebhunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voiceover narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and directionbr br some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based william wylers benhur is an excellent example but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itselfbr br the story is dull and clich√©d and the characters  at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script  are just shallow and boring shadows of guthries literary vision and unfortunately kirk douglas star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was givenbr br if you can believe it the film version of guthries pulitzer prizewinning sequel the way west also starring kirk is even worsebr br in my opinion the big sky further solidifies howard hawks place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema
