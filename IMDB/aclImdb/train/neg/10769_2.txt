i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored how can people possibly give this a 10 its not just that its supposed to be a feelgood redemption film i think because it doesnt work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting theres just nothing there harvey keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible the plot progression especially the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow its only an hour and a half but thats 90 minutes of your life youll never get back
