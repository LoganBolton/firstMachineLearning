this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldnt deliver his lines the plot was definitely not worthy of john grishams name no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters i didnt even watch the whole thing i decided i didnt care who done it then realized there was no whodunit to care about
