might contain possible spoilers not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matterbr br why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion sure its cheaper for them but after a while wouldnt you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices dont even remotely match up and iago is evil again since when i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films even the movies musical number which had been disneys specialty for years stunk i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone even the very young all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released its only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality
