when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldnt fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved itbr br we were misled in spadesbr br on my part i felt billy crystals character was extremely onedimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up spacebr br and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strongwilled selfdetermined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watchingbr br ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now thats entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his characterbr br if youre looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if youre looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film its none of the above
