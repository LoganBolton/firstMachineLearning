i found this film to be an utter dissapointment the talent available to the director notably stanley tucci chris walken hank azaria and alan arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldnt really care about once introduced to the dire stereotyped characters julia roberts is feeble zetajones is just plain annoying appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity minus the humour crystal just plays his same old hyperactive neurotic annoying alterego and cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole projectbr br for what is supposed to be a romantic comedy there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible spoilerswell the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusacks role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever spoilers azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthousemaverickdogme type director but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead spoilers we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog pure geniusbr br for a huge fan of the majority of john cusacks work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost grossout teenmovie humour at timesbr br a very poor 410
