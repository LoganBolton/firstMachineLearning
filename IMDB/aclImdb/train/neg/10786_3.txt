how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible clich√© ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film whats even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snorefest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do dont fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
