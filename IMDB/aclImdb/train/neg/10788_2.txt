and i mean ultra light this film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond thatbr br there really isnt too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isnt very funny nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusingbr br whats really ashame is the premise is not bad at all this movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics the film uncovers the unmined territory of the press junket  those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the films lame romancebr br the same with catherine zetajones character  the whinny self centered movie star zetajones does a good job with what shes given but shes given practically nothing its all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things weve heard about stars over the yearsbr br in the end it is hard to understand what made zetajones julia roberts john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of the love boat in fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal it would probably make a better story so go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this
