if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt305oklar as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt305oklar regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating to much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt305oklar was unsuccessfully to try something new as he has quoted to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt305oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching alt305oklars experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work
