yes kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity here we have shaq as a rapping genie yes a rapping genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a christlike pose with lots of light surrounding him so yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille oneill would be so incredibly schmaltzy the main plot of the film involves this kid played in that alltootypical and annoyingkid fashion by the greatgrandson of frank capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie whos been trapped in a boombox then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the shaqgenie his quasislave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shadygangtype absentee fatherbr br this really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies ie the two chances in life speech from father to son but its shaquille oneill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all his plot line involves him when not getting the overtalky treatment from capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career on top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boombox so is there a camp factor to the movie up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heartfelt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material one might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing id hope that they too knew they were just getting paid but id hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaqmachinebr br so if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genieturnedrapperturnedwisecracker all the more fun to you hell it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel but if youre hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90s
