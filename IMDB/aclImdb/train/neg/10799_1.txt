this movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in shaqfu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible filmmaking that is steelbr br theres not a single good thing to be said about this movie i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young but i mustve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart its fun to mock i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terriblenessbr br if you see it on tv try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers if you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him thats kinda funny and disturbingbr br a horrible example of film do not unless looking to mock it see this movie
