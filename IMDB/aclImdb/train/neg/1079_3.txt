i feel like im the only kid in town who was annoyed by branaghs performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was deplorable it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank one of the previous reviewers questioned why us actors were not cast in this film i second that notion its wonderful when actorsactresses wish to expand their horizons but its another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but hes a such a great directorbr br well i really dont want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that youd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man
