what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know shaq cant act people dont know how to direct and i am kazaam a genie who raps come on maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didnt really interest me i just remember thinking who put shaq in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i cant comment much more because this movie is so terrible theres nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away
