reviewing kazaam and saying its a bad movie isnt hard at allafter all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this filmsaying it was among the worst films of the decade so the fact that i say its bad or anyone else says its bad is certainly no surprise its like someone talking about wwiipractically no one says that was a good thing right the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place after all its obvious to anyone who isnt severely brain injured that the film would be horrible but movies like ed a baseball playing chimp cool as ice starring the everpopular vanilla ice troll 2 which doesnt even have any trolls in it baby geniuses einstainlike superhero babies and pinocchio in outer space huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen so the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright normal br br the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school like the punk from free willy this kid is somehow misunderstood in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film hell have learned something and grown just once i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie kazaam shaquille onealis accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes but the kid doesnt believe him and the genies magic seems a tad rustybr br eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real however unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime kazaam is forced to follow him around everywherelike his own personal servant and according to the cliché you know that by the end of the film max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed oh and max will have come to terms with his absent father and moms fiancé im gonna gag apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishesbr br as for kazaam shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rapvery poorly im a middleaged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well hes an amazing basketball player and ive heard hes a nice guybut a rapperno way as far as his acting goes he wasnt great but had such a nice personality in the film that its hard to hate himeven if they made him do a lot of very stupid thingsbr br so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as youve probably heard through the first twothirds of the movie i would have said no shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script however later in the film the bad becomes horridas kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when hes really needed and out of nowhere the plot gets really really weirdas the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster and oddly this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation br br in addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad i know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids film what part of trying to kill the kid didnt the writers not understand then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a druginduced hallucination this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black holeand boy did it make my brain hurt uggghhthe horrible dialog was just too much to bearbr br overall its a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane yes folks with a messed up message bizarre nonkid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film sadly given the idea and actors its hard to imagine the final product turning out much worsebr br by the way if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good try the british made for tv film bernard and the geniea charming and exceptionally wellwritten film from start to finish
