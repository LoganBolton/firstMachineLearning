the only reason i dvrd this movie was because 1 i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 ive always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were shaqs outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my 12 year old son and i just squirmed and couldnt look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didnt wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all its terribleness we just couldnt stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam
