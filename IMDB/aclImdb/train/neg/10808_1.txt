i was given the book version of kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie its over soonbr br the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor hes bullied by neighborhood kids which i dont blame them because hes a little douche bagbr br the story is just plain stupid and extremely clich√© about a boy whos father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his fatherbr br even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea its a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because its an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot
