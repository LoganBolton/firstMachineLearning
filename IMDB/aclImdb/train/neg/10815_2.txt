i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didnt care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldnt imagine what mr rochester saw in her br br that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didnt hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the productionbr br the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the 1997 ae version which is not all that true to the bookbr br trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role
