there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that were supposed to be pulling for well lets see  we learn hes a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities he treats his coworkers like cattle gets them involved in his own personal crisis in the process getting one of them killed jeopardizes the safety of his kids threatens his exwifes new boyfriend tries to strongarm the police and school administrators  and all this for what because he was thinking with his little head i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swampit would have made for a far more satisfying ending
