what was franco zeffirelli thinking was hollywood responsible for this travesty or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didnt speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte brontes classic i dont think i can improve on a comment i read below so ill just paraphrase it jane eyre is a great great book the screenwriter should read it sometime its true that this movies two leads were sadly miscast but pity the actors because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fundeleted from the script the marriage proposal the fortune tellergone the allusions half joking half sincerely felt to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despaireliminatedbr br it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and janes interactions with the rivers family but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever writtenbr br do yourself a favor and go find the 1983  mini series with timothy dalton
