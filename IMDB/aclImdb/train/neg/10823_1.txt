i dont like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferellis attempt to adapt charlotte brontÃ«s novel jane eyre is a total waste of timebr br the script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination the lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all she is like a wet noodle worse even than joan fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flickbr br joan plowrights mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out br br there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochesters first wife the role of the wouldbe second wife played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson is an empty cipherbr br fiona shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as janes aunt mrs reed she would have been bettercast as mrs fairfax only amanda root as janes beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability br br i saw this version of jane eyre after viewing robert youngs for british television made in 1997 starring ciaran hinds samantha morgan and gemma jones there is no comparison youngs vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferellis wet squibbr br i will be interested now to see the 1970 version with timothy dalton about which ive read some very good things on this website i am amazed at how many people liked zefferellis yorkshire picture book br br about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud
