i cant say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i havent seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasnt quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like youre watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities its like he sits in his little directors chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesnt have it in him i dont know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i squirmed in my seat i kept saying please please just dont have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure
