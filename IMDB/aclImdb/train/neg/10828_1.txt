thats not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now dont get me wrong here either im not a total philistine i didnt hate the movie because it wasnt enough like police academy 9 or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swearbr br magnolia is poor and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie theres some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self confessed tom cruise hater tells me its his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snails pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or somethingbr br it doesnt help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well i didnt think so but i dont like most people admittedly they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in everso intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route yadda yadda yadda the soundtracks dire as well with that marrowsuckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisettebr br all in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat the bit with the frogs is good though
