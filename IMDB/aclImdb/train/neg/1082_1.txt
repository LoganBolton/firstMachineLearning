i think ive seen all of the grisham movies now and generally theyre all very poor except for the rainmaker but this one is so bad its unbelievablebr br warning spoilerishbr br its one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do hes a lawyer for christs sake why when his children go missing does he not call the police oh yes its because all the police hate lawyers so theyre just ignore him and let him be attackedbr br when hes arrested for murder they just let him go free he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing br br why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at homebr br the police dont bother to try and find an escaped mental patient they dont bother to interview his daughterbr br as for the ridiculous endingbr br in summary silly very unrealistic and a complete waste of timebr br 010  one of the worst films ever made
