my guess is that this directorwriter had something to say lets see what it could have been a frog storms would be creepy b can i get someone like tom cruise to say the c word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter c cast my wife and get her to say the f word every 2 seconds this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm the rest was a relentless overlong underedited overindulgent failure glad so many of you enjoyed it br br
