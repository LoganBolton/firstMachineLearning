great cast great acting unpredictable story line for the first halfbr br hour or so i was really wanting to know what was going tobr br happen to each of these unredeeming characters and how theirbr br seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined but whenbr br the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players theybr br mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstillbr br for the last two hours i kept thinking it would get better but it onlybr br got worse dont believe the reviews this is a waste of time br br think about it  tom cruise made ugly  why the gorgeousbr br hunky bartender wearing braces  why i know it had to do withbr br the plot but without them at least there would have been onebr br attractive cast member to remember
