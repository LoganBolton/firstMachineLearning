magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who cant care for others except for john c reillys and philip seymour hoffmans characters and are selfdestructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin muellerstahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with thembr br having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas andersons ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this 188minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee manns coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we cant see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculousbr br magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didnt know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldnt hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
