i cant tell you how angry i was after seing this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is nonexistant so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of frogs now yes i understand the references to the bible exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or charles fort a still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episodebr br dont waste your time it would be better spent readingbr br well anything to be honest
