this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a childrens comic i gave it 2 out of 10 for its attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the makeup was goodbr br this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally  usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that noone knew about the program and wasnt common knowledge well that never happened
