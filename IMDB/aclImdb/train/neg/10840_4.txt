i happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others so i tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and funbr br wrong i just have to wonder at the end of this was charlies angels really that boring i dont seem to remember it as such but this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show i did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasnt unwatchable but it was very bland which i do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them the movie just wasnt that interesting it tried to make each angel a character one angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husbandall characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog wasdialog thats pretty much itbr br not awful not the worst of tv movies but missable
