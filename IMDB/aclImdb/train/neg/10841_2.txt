it was everything this isnt it had pace pop and actors who werent afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah isnt really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they werent industry names but they werent exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday hell create a show for her obviously did not happenbr br what bothered me was how spellings role is distorted hes shown as the showrunner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughablebr br how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrahs oral contract when the others were signed and why didnt farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid  that was where the threes company pic delivered
