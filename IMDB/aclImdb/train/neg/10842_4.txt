noting the cast i recently watched this movie on tcm hoping for an underappreciated gem as i regard many films from the 30s this is no gem  not even semiprecious the anachronistic clothing and 1930s rolls royce limo hit you immediately the casting is strange also but mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components arent mixed according to the right recipe it simply doesnt come together like it should and thats a shame with a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good moviebr br the film is about an american showgirl jean harlow seeking a rich british husband  preferably from the nobility she meets franchot tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddys employer harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls and she sets her sights on him this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction br br however tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german 5th columnist on the eve of wwi and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart tone and harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a mata haritype benita hume and harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of tones murder in fact tone recovers from the woundsbr br harlow flees to france where she falls in love again  this time with a wealthy french cad cary grant tone now in the army and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grants hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash in the following scene tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a golddigger harlow never explains about the witness accusing her of murder and her panic that is one of those unreal movieplotdevice breakdowns in the storybr br then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman hume who shot him she is on hand to watch her paramour grant test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england incredibly both hume and tone dimly recognize each other but simply cant place where from okay so tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks she does not seem to be faking the memory lapsebr br this is inexplicable and unnecessary hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that tone wasnt able to place her that would have been a much better treatment of that issuebr br the finale also is very unsatisfying the movie as made has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero then harlow and tone just walk away it is noble to preserve the french publics perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love storybr br what the film begs for is this harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grants reputation meanwhile harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is harlow rekindles feelings for him too at films end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grants death after grants heros burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fadeout that would have made a nice little movie for cary grant fans it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the longsuffering first husband reunited with harlowbr br it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england while cary grant is cast as the frenchman this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been
