this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film ive seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case im surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too im glad i only rented i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in workbr br notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing dont buy it
