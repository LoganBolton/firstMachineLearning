it surprisingly had a plot  ive seen movies with less plot i dont wanna mention asian movies but i thought the camera wasnt bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasnt too bad there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens although i do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of coursebr br it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes the acting was bad but ive seen worse the movie was bad but ive seen worse watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low levelbr br so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for youbr br i gave it 310 because it can be entertaining if you dont expect to see a good movie and youre in the right mood
