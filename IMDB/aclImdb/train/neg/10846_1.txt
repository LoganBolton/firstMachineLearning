not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie halfway throughbut then with this one i was only 15 minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do notbr br its not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual its that its not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead its boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audiblenot that its worth hearing thoughbr br this movie is proof for the argument that even the straighttovideo distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
