this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think hes just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still im generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed im in for a rollercoaster ride of rubber gore and doityourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do likebr br i got home and popped it in my patience lasted 15 minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture br br after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my disliking evolved i noticed how funny dani 165m 55 height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i havent finished it yet so i wasnt positivebr br after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick  a couple of months back yes it took me 55 years so  dani in fact was funny as satanmansonsuperevilmans helper and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess hes just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much itbr br we have a couple of short stories joined by danis character my favourite was about a guy who steals someones leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly br br the actings rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beats it and boy is stingers cgi baaaaad the story has no sense and the quality is lets just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on example  dani the man filth takes a stuffed cat  fake as can be  and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his sizebr br you might think after my comment that this movie is so bad its good but its just bad cradle of filth fans can add 3 points i added one for gore
