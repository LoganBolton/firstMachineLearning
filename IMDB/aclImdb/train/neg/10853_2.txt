and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way first of all its a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes your wildest imagination doesnt even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out now i love horror movies and i am very proviolence but i do think that it has to lead somewhere  is that too much to ask  cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts the movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story this results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common not very informative if you ask me and yet  it has to be said  the basic plot idea surely has potential its about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial personally i think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie everbr br secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess they didnt have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and gutstons of it  the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst ive ever seen any other special effects besides the makeup looks very amateurish  like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example  theres no tension or atmosphere to detect anywherenot even an attempt to build up onebr br cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least with the presence of deathmetal icon danni filth  from the band cradle of filthget the link   this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasingbah i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when youre easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind for every selfrespecting horror fan this movie is an insult
