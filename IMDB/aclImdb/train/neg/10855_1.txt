this sure is one comedy im not likely to forget for a whilebr br wouldnt normally bother to comment on this movie its so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens its kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it isbr br so what is it then well of course its not really a comedy instead its intended as a horror flick  intended very much being the key word here the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that theyre especially pathetic and as for the acting well lets just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talentbr br of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower ones expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned also even though im a big fan of the horror genre im aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch actingbr br but stillbr br bmovies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances if you can find the humour in thatand i could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after thatthen thats going to be the only thing the movie has to offer oh that and two or three pairs of breastsbr br woohoo how excitingbr br as for the story its not even that it doesnt try to convey anything the victims either use drugs andor are involved in serious crime the lesson watch out naughty boys and girls because one day youll be made to pay for what youve donebr br i rest my casebr br so all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock n rollbr br i rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if i could or perhaps i wouldnt it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors names correctly in the titles i mean thats something innit
