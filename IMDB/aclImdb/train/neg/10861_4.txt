maybe im missing something because ive read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews  and i just dont get it i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j cobb his rumpled rolledoutofbed look is about as far from the dashing smoothtalking noir archetype as youll find or take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of miscasting ive seen in a while shes just not convincing in the rolebr br as for the plot its tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final catandmouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it
