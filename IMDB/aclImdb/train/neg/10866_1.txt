lets see where to begin bad acting im not sure if id even call it that as it more along the lines of a noeffort script read the actors didnt even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldnt save this movie from its lifeless charactersbr br to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rantsbr br budget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than ive seen in a homeshot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i dont care who directed itbr br ive seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom dont waste your time or youll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review check the ratings youll see the 1s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10s with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suckfest
