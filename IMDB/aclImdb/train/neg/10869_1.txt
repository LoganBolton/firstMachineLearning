a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james hetfields slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think why am i watching this that question will be coursing through your minds in 5 Â– 10 minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watchingbr br just my opinionbr br
