i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novelso invariably my expectations were crushed but they were crushed more than should be expected the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for mebr br in any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves the scene at bishop myriels was fine in fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of fantine because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute the worst she does is run into the mayors office and spit on his face bamatabois is entirely eliminated because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about tholomyes is fantines dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up thankfully it was saved after this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butcheringbr br as cosette and valjean are riding through the park they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting about prison reform when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set we arent revolutionaries i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave of course they are revolutionaries they want to revolt against the pseudomonarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters its a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 br br at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine exceptnot eponine or at least not the eponine of the book this eponine appears to be a welltodo secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her notperiod lowcut tightfitting dress and her snooty mannerismsbr br the prison reformers lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen decide that handing out pamphlets isnt good enough anymore so theyre going to build barricades i dont know about you but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades etc eponine does die for marius thankfully br br the rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that javerts suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown he saved the mans life earlier why let him die now then theres the whole skipping of valjeans confession to marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his sidebr br overall i can blame the script mostly for the problems while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene the elimination of fantines suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her that cosette knows valjeans past from the start messes with the plot a good deal i did not even see thenardier and mme thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time the same with gavroche i did like frederich marchs interpretation of valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie on the other hand charles laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with javert the lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong he also like many javerts i have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the characterbr br again this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book i would not recommend it to book purists though i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before
