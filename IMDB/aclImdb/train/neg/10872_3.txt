heres an indie film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture the story is a nonsensical mess that isnt worth trying to figure out i quickly became bored within 10 minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minuteshoping for the bestbefore hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasnt worth the extra effort ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix as a result theres very little in ozark savage that hasnt been done before and better this film would have been much more fun as a 1020 minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced of course theres no money in shorts so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes director matt steinauer shows great promise and i wish him luck
