this film is so much of a ripoff of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terriblethe action scenes are speeded upthe script is almost painful and budget non existentbr br if you think this film is good then you havnt seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
