this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen from the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission as it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a nonchalonte manner with pledge over reacting and overdoing the whole eager to be popular role what really took the cake with this one is the final battle absolutely horrible special effects with the guns for example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and viceversa this is accompanied by stopanimation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowherebr br overall this movie is crap just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place
