this film wasnt programmed in italian cinemasi have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestivali find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and theres no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i dont have words to describe the visual effectsif you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busythe story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
