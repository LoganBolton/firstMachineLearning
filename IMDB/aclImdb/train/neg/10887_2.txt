this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worsebr br the jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style bloodteetheyes give it that awful look and the script is direthis film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it its also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesnt let the film down its also terrible
