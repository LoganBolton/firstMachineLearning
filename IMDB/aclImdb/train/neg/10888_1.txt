this film is absolutely horrific one of the worst movies ive ever seen the story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the specialfx only make you laugh the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officerbr br if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didnt quite get the point if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughsespecially when the first specialfx appear on the screenbr br but if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a mustsee for you
