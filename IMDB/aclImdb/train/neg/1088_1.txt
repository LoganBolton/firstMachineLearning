rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings actors of stature  robert duvall robert downey jr  are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffeestained camera lens a writer john grisham who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of undermotivated incoherence the film has a cheap lecherous feel about it  but barely at the level of commentary  its really part of the aesthetic normally i come on to the imdb to write balanced generally appreciative comments this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless bilious rant i wont but only because i no longer want to occupy my mind with this trash
