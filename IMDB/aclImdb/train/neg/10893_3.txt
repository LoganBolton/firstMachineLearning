this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be i dread to think what the blockbusterapproved edit must have looked like because the directors cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions naturally you dont expect it to be the godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handybr br also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully underexploited i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy but even i have a right to expect a little more it wasnt a total loss though at least we got a peek a drew fullers covered junk and truly upsetting haircut and theres huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in bring it on and acting about as well theres always a silver lining kids you just have to look really hard for it and occasionally you have to make use of your pause button
