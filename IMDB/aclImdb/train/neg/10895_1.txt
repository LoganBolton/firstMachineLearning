i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremesbr br it is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finishbr br a blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costsbr br
