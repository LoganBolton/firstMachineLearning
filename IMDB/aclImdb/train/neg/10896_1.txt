i know youve read that before on countless other films no doubt if youre reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film ive been able to track down no doubt the really bad ones arent even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel its fair to qualify that im not just some dumb renter who picked badlybr br ive seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb and im ticking of the remaining ones with every chance most of those stand head and shoulders above this excersize in absolute monotonybr br i like to rate truly bad films as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through if you can watch it by yourself it isnt that bad if you can watch it with one single friend its bad but could be a lot worsebr br it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films spotting the boom mic for example 3 times in this one if im not mistaken could take away the dry taste in my mouth yes id watched it but id also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that endbr br i hope and pray we saw the directors cut to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me so much of the film centers around thisbr br i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes but it isnt a good film the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money considering inflation and was an utter gem its not an excuse for how bad this baby isbr br spoilers aheadbr br its not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters the pacing of the film is insane nothing is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging no matter what your alignment or sex rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen timebr br the acting is cheese but not overly amatuer ive seen a lot worse in better films but somehow its the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines youll ever hear in a film that really gratesbr br rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if youre going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair its an endurance test you probably want to skipbr br im sure there is worse but i wouldnt be surprised if it has decoteaus name on it
