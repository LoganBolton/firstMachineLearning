you cant hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days and i had expected it to be campy anyway its not all that campy in reality with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter who dont take themselves seriously the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight riley smith is exceptionally bad the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to which kind of shocked me i assumed the whole purpose with these ultralowbudget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story but they use lots of words like technological and physicality in the script to get their point across although its possible that the story is important only to explain why theres so few cast members nobody cares about this stupid storyline and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the softcore homoeroticisms which arent all that edgy i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason the film is grainy with a tvquality look and acting level there are a few sexy scenes that are alright  the boys writhing in bed in their boxers feeling themselves up or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them  and some of them are kinda funny and i liked the digs at l ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones but it still isnt any good 310
