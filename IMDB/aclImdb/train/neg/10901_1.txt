and a few more nos on top of that voodoo academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time what exactly is it trying to do tell a story obviously not as has been pointed out most of its just barelylegal guys rubbing themselves could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact which is to the delight of none repeated about eighty thousand times well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his workbr br never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing ive ever seen its like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a grinder then runs them through a coffee filteronly instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans its the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting the result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm wateronly without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort
