i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow which i enjoyed however this dud seemed to last forever its one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg13 while not being kid appropriate the jokes arent just lowbrow or ft jokes theyre crude lewd and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg13 ratingtoo badit might have made a bigger splash as an rrated film if the funny was left in overstatement probably i do not recommend this movie it is a fullon waste of timeand im a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot at 45 minutes in the movie felt like it should be winding downand boy were we ready for it to the ending is quaint but doesnt salvage the rest of this quagmiretourist trap of a rental 12 star glad i saw it as a freebiewould have been sickened to pay hardearned greenbacks for this tripe
