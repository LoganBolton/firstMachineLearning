nothing in this movie is funny i thought the premise giving a human the libido of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs wrong there is simply nothing funny about the movie for example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmers yard is not funny it borders on obscenity they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level and it just aint funnybr br we all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime the main character doing this with everything everywhere everytime is also not funny it becomes a clichebr br rob schneider is i guess acceptable in the role by this i mean that hes not a bad actor but with rotten material its difficult to comment on quality however coleen haskell the other half of the humanromantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum detached from all the other actors in the movie br br see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material
