this is a very bad movie i laughed once or twice and the storyline sucks there is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring through the whole short movie i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to endbr br no one acts human and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous rob schneider acting like an animal isnt something i would pay to see it looked funny but the bottom line dont waste youre precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid moviebr br i was wondering when it was going to end even though it is a short movie in the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse stupid all the way to the end i walked out of the theater and i would remember that movie as extremely bad foreverbr br the writer and coproducer of this film is a simpsons tv writer but this is nothing like the simpsons this movie sucks
