i didnt really like this movie that much at all it wasnt really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but thats about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and im not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average moviebr br final querybr br theaters so glad i didnt squander too much money on thisbr br dvd purchase ummm let me thinknobr br rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not
