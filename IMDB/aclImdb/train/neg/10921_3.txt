i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently and the scifi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find as such im sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion the acting was uncharacteristically subpar as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display scifi usually has in store for us there are a few cameos made by people youd most likely recognize although you may not know their names by heart the cgi special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy in a scifi feature is lacking sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl hes known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and i consider that a major disappointmentbr br if i was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge madefor tv movies id probably give it a 4 maybe even a 5 a real shame that i may have to wait till the next scifi original movie to get a good laugh and i really hope that this movie isnt part of some overall quality increase in scifi original movies
