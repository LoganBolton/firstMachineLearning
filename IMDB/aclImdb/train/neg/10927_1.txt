reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice tremblays supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain its audience i didnt hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through its pagethin story line and onedimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldnt seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper lodyss√©e dalice tremblay is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you
