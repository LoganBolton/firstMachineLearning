this movie is a total dog i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldnt feel like id totally wasted my moneyand my time the writing in this film is absolutely terrible its a shame its not up to the standards of other hale storm moviesbr br they should have saved the money on getting dlist actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right even gary coleman wasnt properly utilized for his rolebr br this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot wasincluding the subplots after viewing this movie im left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamitelike humor where its not so much the lines as the character and the delivery unfortunately this movie fails to deliver the lines the characters the delivery or the humor i should have gone to the dentist instead
