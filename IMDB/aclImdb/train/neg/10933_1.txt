trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation youve heard about semidevout mormons and youll see theyve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt hales fortunes have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theatersbr br the cinematography was amateurish i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didnt understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a 300pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painfulbr br the only reason i didnt give this movie a negative rating was because the scale wont let me
