first lets all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy however in this piece of  called snakeeater the film industry as a whole sankbr br first lets start with the plot a vietnam vet named jack kelly aka soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys feet and pins them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister had some potential but still pretty thin to begin withbr br now the acting being an actor myself i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art lamas is well himself the jackasses playing the clampetsdeliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their socalled performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big breakbr br finally the action the gunfighting is soso at best and the fistfighting is deplorable ive seen more reallooking fights at the renaissance festival and those were pretty fakelookingbr br readers listen to me avoid this piece of caca at all costs if it were the only film in existence you still would want to avoid it for the sake of your braincell count do not watch this thing
