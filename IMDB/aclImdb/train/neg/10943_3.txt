this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though all the characters are just annoying except lamas and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for plus the action is very boring the film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up plus it looks very cheap and amateurish lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma but he cant save this piece of crap and believe it or not the opening was really cool as was the ending however the middle is incredibly boring and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button plus the dialog is especially laughablethere is a cool bar scene that i really liked but once lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart plus the scene where the villains torture jennifers family and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though however it is not enough not recommended the direction is very bad george erschbamer does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work bland location and keeping the film at a boring pace the acting is pretty bad except for lamas lorenzo lamas is awesome here and while he isnt required to act he is quite fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma however even he cant save this oneand he had no chemistry with the cast either lamas rules josie bell is terrible here and while shes decent looking she isnt very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas cheryl jeans is hot but does not have much to do but scream and scared she did okay at thatrobert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain and wasnt menacing at all he was laughable as were the other 2 rest of the cast are bad overall avoid avoid even if you do like lamas like me  out of 5
