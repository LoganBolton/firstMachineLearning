now ive seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies ive seen and enjoyed all of jeanclaude van dammes movies including the one where hes his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where hes a cyborg i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians hey if nothing else hes got a great ass and you almost always get to see it with dvd you can even pause and zoom in thats why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad it makes plan 9 look like citizen kanebr br everything about snake eater is bad the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad the fights are bad the stunts are bad the fx are bad the acting is spectacularly earthtimebendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every socalled actor in the cast including lorenzo lamas and thats really saying something and id be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot especially lorenzo lamas br br it does manage to be unintentionally funny so its not a total loss however i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundrybr br it didnt help much but it was better than nothing one point for ron palillos cameo as a gay arsonist
