that malcom show on fox is really making a killing cant we do our own version i speculate and paraphrase of course but in our hearts we all know its true and that the only thing nbc added to the malcom metric was sex and boy did they add sexbr br thirteenyearold tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window and this is all in the pilotbr br take it from a grown man a boys puberty is so sexcrazy and testicledriven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies and you can count those on one hand so its no surprise that tucker has the warmth and appeal of a stripclub bathroom did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty isnt this the stuff people go to jail for if you doubt the shows depravity consider this 13 episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only 4 episodes aired they then made the unprecedented move of burning off the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them ironic since kids were originally the target audience br br apart from its general scuzziness tucker features a running voiceover from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing even in 2000 it was horribly dated with its ska incidental music and supersarcasm i couldnt like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didnt exactly come a mileaminute shame on nbc for this dirty ripoff theyre better than thatbr br grade c
