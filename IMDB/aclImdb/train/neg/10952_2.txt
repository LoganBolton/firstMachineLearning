i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input i know theyre going for realism but to be frank i just dont want realism realism is boring if i want to see daily life ill uhm live tell me an interesting story and well talk i can deal with the low production values hell im a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously im supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out i can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see rosetta walking to someplace rosetta working in a bakery rosetta eating a waffle rosetta carrying around bags of far rosetta walking back home rosetta walking someplaceits just not that entertaining there isnt really a deeper meaning either i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but its just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business i guess im supposed to love this but come on theres nothing in there
