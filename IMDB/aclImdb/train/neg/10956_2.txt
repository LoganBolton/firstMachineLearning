i bought this movie from gamestops discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for 99cents the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkeybr br the director more than likely committed a murdersuicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also doesnt help that he wasnt even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasnt even known for producing a poopchute filmbr br why was this movie ever made
