i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a cyber kungfu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering is this the film thats going to break the mold lets face it america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar after such great classics as monkey trouble and dunston checks in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes funky monkey i laughed i cried i contemplated suicidebr br now ive read about demon possession in the bible but that still doesnt explain why someone would create such a product of evil first off having at least a shred of intelligence i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all however i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film they didnt let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of zit has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers why i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesnt seem costeffective well anyways zit brings in a cia specialist matthew modine to train clemens the chimp clemens is everything zit hoped for he can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that were watching a kids movie as you may have guessed modine finds out that zits intentions may be evil gasp and decides to break clemens out being a cia agent and all modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everythingbr br zit finds out where modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis or was it turner and hooch it doesnt matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win yay hooray for predictability throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get funky monkey the climax to the movie a football game played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football gamebr br funky monkey never lets up its edge of your seat entertainment some might even call this the american beauty of monkeyfilled features after finishing this epic i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe funky monkey is a metal rod among movies
