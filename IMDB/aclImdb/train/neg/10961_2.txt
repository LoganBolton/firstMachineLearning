though the movie may have been true to lewiss book in that the script was basically wordforword verbatim it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this the mythical creatures unicorns centaurs griffins ghouls ghosts are drawn in and as in the previous review the greenscreen flying sequence was very hard to swallow i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth i nearly cried when i heard the wolfs howl a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly couldbr br all of the acting is tremendously forced especially that of little lucy penvensie i could only take so much indignation desperation and buck teeth in the what felt like fourteen hours of watching the movie the actress who plays the white witch in all her histrionics seems that shed be more at home on stage where a booming voice spread arms and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome br br the sets feel claustrophobic whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors indoors its as if bbc could only afford to spend 100 on constructing a set and so it is very small and all the characters are constantly huddled together the white witchs castle is a rundown rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods actually any scene in the woods feels like they are simply wandering around in circles br br the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan but you can bet that bbc probably blew the films entire budget on building the mechanical feline it looks great when its standing still and before it starts speaking but once it starts moving you cant help but pity the poor man who has to be the rearend in the lion suit br br yes if you are a hardcore narnia fan you may want to see this version simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote but lewis was certainly no screenwriter and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen during the scene in which the children are at the beavers and getting ready to flee from the wolves mrs beavers incessant oh just one more thing dearies and then we will be ready to go punctuated by the childrens simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of no mrs beaver please  a scene of comic relief so incongruous they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have in fact the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these br br i would recommend seeing the new narnia disney 2005 the new movie with updated effects spectacular computer animation great timing all around and a gorgeous and scene stealing white witch who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician as opposed to a shrieking banshee captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewiss original vision i think lucy is a lot cuter no buck teeth yay as are the beavers and realisticallysized and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine desperatelyhungryforacceptanceinsecureand angstingwithaninferioritycomplex edmund that the new disney version fronts br br unless youre the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies i would not recommend this film to anyone
