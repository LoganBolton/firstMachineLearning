i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a devout fan of lewis carrolls alice books i was very excited about this movies premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally im enthusiastic about modern retellings if they are treated well usually its interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion the adaptation of the originals characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didnt help that the actors werent very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfmans work also id have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave danceoff was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the filmbr br what a joke dont see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry
