im actually watching this film as i write this    if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it   br br but    i thought am still thinking as im presently viewing that this film    to put it mildly is very very overrated again verybr br it looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources    and who didnt pay that much attention to detailbr br i dont want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but    well    i just dont get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe its me thats the idiot here  not the film maker  for not getting this piece of imaginative genius    i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding   br br sheesh
