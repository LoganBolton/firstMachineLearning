a friend once told me that an arthouse independent film ran in a cinema when upon the closing of the film  audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats of course my imagination ran amok trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work wellnow my imagination can be put to restbr br i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work i have come across many people who thought tarkovskys films are slowmoving and inert opinions being what they are i found this not to be true of the late directors wonderful works which are wrought with meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky i was excited to experience his filmsbr br with the exception of the open air ride through the fields stalker this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning even on a completely mindless level its supposedly gorgeously stark cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft there is a no balance no proportion and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow the main character is so inept and indecisive it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind soonerbr br i am also not adverse to nonplots or story lines that progress on multiple nonlinear fashion but there isnt even a nonstory here one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost as hairpulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin shortbr br i wont rule out that this may be one of sokurovs stinkers tarkovskys solaris but to conclude that he is one of tarkovskys heirbased on this film would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle cmon guys dont be afraid to say it no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life i dont profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably dont have russian values but i immediately picked up on tarkovskys work as something magical a treasure and a gift to viewersbr br if it didnt have sokurovs name on it and it aired on say saturday night live im pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick
