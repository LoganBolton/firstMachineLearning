believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like lowbudget b movies br br sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars br br it just doesnt work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia and the many allusions to male genitalia in a very freudian waybr br i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiencesbr br i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen br br about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was stupendous if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended br br to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldnt be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed 15 was it the dialog emphatically no the music perhaps but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked br br much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
