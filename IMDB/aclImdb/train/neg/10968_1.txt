 this contains many many spoilers not that it matters since everything is so patently obvious br br oh my god where do i start well here  this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now it is my civic duty such is the badness of this flick br br begin digression but let me just state one thing before i start im not some harvardartmajorfilmnoirweenie in fact i went to the college at the other end of mass ave in cambridge the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go which should put me squarely in the nerdwhowouldobsessivelylovecomicbookfilms census group and still i hated this film my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards bond flicks clerks and the grail i wish the titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldnt have been subjected to that dungheap of a film and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on imdb for gods sake so im as shallow as they come therefore im not criticizing this film because im looking for some standard of cinematic excellence  its because elektra stinks like a threeweekold dead goat end digressionbr br ok theres so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it here goesbr br ms garner one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar i have no idea why my wife wanted to i think that between this and finding nemo the latter was the sexier film you know the red outfit shes advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see you see her in it twice  once at the beginning once at the end bummer in the rest she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female  lots of pouting and black clothes which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting  ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying oh my god youd think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that um waitbr br the bad guysgal they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that youd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit at least next to jgars performance it doesnt stand out too badly one guys role is to stand there and be huge anothers is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the womans role is to stand there and breathe on andor kiss people they manage to pull these incredible feats off the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all  he has to simultaneously a appear angry and b appear asian he does a fine job at this i think there was a fifth bad guygal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in selfdefensebr br plot twists this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention lets just put it this way  my wife who has only been in the us for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english  whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jgs pad and i swear to god i am not making this up she go to house to kill girl and father too and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen now my wife isnt stupid but she isnt being courted by mensa for her gifts either and shes had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre and she figured this out in 00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information such is the blatant obviousness of this film br br rarelybeforeseen stupidity ok so theres this big dude in the film he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like its lint and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it  or something  more defenses kicking in thank god but jg jumps on his head and he explodes an achilles noggin ok such is the mindnumbing stupidity of this filmbr br ack im starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so i have to stop but you have been warned if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie do it and if armageddon is going to come please let it be before this comes out on dvd
