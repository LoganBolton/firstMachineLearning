this is absurd  aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick i cant help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra considering how generous they were with their praisebr br admittedly im not really a fan of comicbooktomovie conversions so i didnt go in with many expectations yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained that left you thinking huh what relevance does that have to the plot or so how did that aspect of the character come about i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil which i have no intention of seeingbr br furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an aboutface at random moments to suit the storyline and dont even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic subplot im also still scratching my head over the fate of caryhiroyuki tagawas character which seems to have gone by unexplainedbr br if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra i know were supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasyaction films but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing even by action film standards that it simply frustrated mebr br well hell at least jennifer garner looks damn good
