this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervouslaughter urbanlife affirming film but its more of a camera jerky mess its a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldnt care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasnt any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong
