im irish and ive been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission and i will go on record as sayingbr br this film is awfulbr br it is not quite as bad a something like the most fertile man in ireland but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments i went down or michael collinsbr br some aspects of the film are actually quite funny such as colm meaneys americanstyle garda but the film itself is shot completely wrong the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoomin zoomout tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama but it isnt this is an irish lock stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next the film just looks sloppy and thrown togetherbr br the performances are okay given the awful script a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag but it no way compares to his performances in minority report tigerland or phone booth the best performance was from dierdre okane who plays a sexually frustrated middleaged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman i think she should leave her godawful standup and focus more on her actingbr br all in all its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films everbr br im expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great but before you reply ask yourself would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america
