usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesnt have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case herebr br bonesetter is a perfect example of a 010 film it does nothing right and it doesnt have the chance to because it doesnt really attempt to do anything there are strands of a bad dd novel kind of plot which doesnt hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons hard work would amount to more a truly awful film
