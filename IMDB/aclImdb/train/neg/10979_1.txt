words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is i wish it were so bad its good but its not its just dull lifeless and boring its so bad i couldnt even laugh at itbr br in response to other posters annemarie frigon is not the highlight of the movie the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead they both look like inbreeds sister and brotherbr br the gal sherry thurig is a looker the complete opposite of annemarie  attractive this girl is tall and willowy and can act although you can tell shes holding backbr br all the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male mark ive seen less wood in a rain forest but hes still better than kelly why would kelly keep his actors from acting is he really that bad a director everyone else has summed the story up perfectly  there isnt one kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime i know how he felt stepping in the poo its how i felt after watching his moviebr br yes i tried to get my money back from the rental store this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director and if you search them out youll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks
