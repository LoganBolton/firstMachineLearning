or listening to for that matter even the soundtrack is a bore br br honestly this isnt the worst gay movie ive seen that would be regarding billy but its down there very close to the bottom of the barrelbr br this thing drags and drags and drags its not that the plot is inanein the hands of a good writer it might have worked    it certainly could have been much more entertaining theres not one plot point you cant see coming for ten miles down the road the dialog is flat the jokes are old to add insult to injury its full of onedimensional stereotypical gays br br nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other    were just told theyre in love hard to figure when they have nothing in common and arent compatible sexually they like the same book huhbr br the acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow i mean almost jarmusch slow but without jarmusch quality in fact that would be a good barometer for you if you like jarmusch films avoid this one
