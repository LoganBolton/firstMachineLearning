when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago it would have been something quite different for the time so therefor some people would have found it quite scary and may well have been impressed with the special effectsbr br looking at the play in this day and age it doesnt seem to be all that scary anymore even the special effects can leave a lot to be desiredbr br would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel i dont think sobut if you watch this play again you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes straight through the red light maybe thats how it was in dickens timebr br you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting i cant help but notice things like thatbr br i will not take anything away from the acting both denholm elliott signalman and bernard lloyd the traveller gave wonderful performancesbr br i am not at all sure what is going oni mean was the ghost the traveller or what does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story well maybe i am the only one that dontbr br to sum upbr br the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character it suffers from not being that scary these days and a little if not very confusing in places and has some rather unusual signalling practisesbr br thanks for reading my review
