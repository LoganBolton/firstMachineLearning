i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what its about somebody got murdered or maybe they didnt and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didnt this brought back memories of the good old days bad old days when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time ive never found margaret atwoods books easy to read this movie continues that fine canadian tradition it isnt easy to watch maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious
