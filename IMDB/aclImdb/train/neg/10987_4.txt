i greatly enjoyed margaret atwoods novel the robber bride and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an excop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead womans crazy female friends its fortunate that the movie script fixes ms atwoods clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming womenbr br heh okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and im pretty sure theyre entirely made up for the movie ill eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel arent enough to carry the movie zenias manipulations arent interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a mans life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories  to a man because its not important if a man doesnt hear thembr br i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a mans story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i hadnt read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the excop and you want to read more about them youre out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot its the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst its like zenias revenge on margaret atwood
