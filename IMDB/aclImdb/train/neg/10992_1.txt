the underground comedy movie is possibly the worst train wrecks ive ever seen luckily i didnt pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was i love off color comedy i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained no instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found maybe there wasnt supposed to be a plot so i cant hold that against this movie its pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a batby batmana man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat hilarious simply genius i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didnt understand or perhaps its the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic oceanbr br ps dont buy this movie
