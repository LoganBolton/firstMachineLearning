the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies ive ever seen i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laughbr br this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic batman sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit they just arent funny the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between  watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin for example  but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offers ineptness at comedybr br keep the underground comedy movie underground bury it
