i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberals fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrells character was allowed to get away with by his superior officersbr br i kept thinking hey theres a reason why boot camp is tough its supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit theres no room for cocky attitudes and men who wont follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with peoples feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unitbr br br br
