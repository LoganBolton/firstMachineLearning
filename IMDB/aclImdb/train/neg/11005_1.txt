this movie shows a row of sketches which partly pass over into one another i realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only irritated me br br many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact using absurdity and obscenity the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits failsbr br my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie my god it hurts in my head every time i call it movie a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great but it failed at least the director made something out of nothing but it isnt something goodbr br many movies didnt turn out as funny as they were planned but this one tops them all its the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making no to correct myself its even worse than that a movie with gags so bad that they arent funny at all its not even fun to watch the leadactor writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies the movie is too bad for that
