i rated this movie as awful 1 after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to offendeveryone the trailer said wellit did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and whats with all the gays in this movie im not gay and i dont have a problem with those who are but whats the point of adding so many gayscenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like thatbr br so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy youve already seen a million times youll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedys it really is total crap
