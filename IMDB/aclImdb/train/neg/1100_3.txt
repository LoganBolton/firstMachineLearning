since most reviews of this film are of screenings seen decades ago id like to add a more recent one the film opens with stock footage of b17s bombing germany the film cuts to oskar werners hauptmann captain wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitlers fuehrer bunker once inside they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel the film then cuts to one of many conference scenes with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officers to ultimate victory while werners character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizens are caught up in a fantasy worldsome nonbunker events are depicted most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak units and his familys difficulty in survivingthis film suffers from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 years after ww2 should not have included the actor portraying goebbels willy krause wears the same uniform as hitler including arm eagle goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armbandthe ss soldiers wear german army camouflage the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boys of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker it was done outside in the courtyard and lastly hitlers suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model 1922most accounts agree it was a walther ppksome bits of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable this bit is shown as a cabaret skit with a intoxicated wounded soldier his arm in a splint maniacally goosestepping to music while a nurse does a combination stripteasebelly dance all by candlelight this is actually embarrassing to watchthe most incredible bit is when werners captain wust gains an audience alone with skodas hitler hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench drugged and delirious when werners character begins to question him hitler starts screaming which brings in a ss guard who mortally wounds werners character in the back with a gunshotthis fabricated scene is not based on any true historic accountwerners character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepares his own ending hitlers farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is offscreen the final seconds of the movie show hitlers funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar wernerhauptmann wustthis film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent films such as the 1973 remake hitler the last 10 days or the german film downfall der untergang if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story these last two films are based on first person eyewitness accounts with hitler the last 10 days being compiled from gerhard boldts autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and downfall being done from hitlers secretarys recollections the screen play for der letzte akte is taken from american nuremberg war crimes trial judge michael musmannos book ten days to die which is more a compilation of events many obviously fanciful than eyewitness historyit is surprising that hugh trevor ropers accountthe last days of hitler was never made into a film
