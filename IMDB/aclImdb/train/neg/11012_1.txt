and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right comedy is hard this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think its atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically these bozos are comparing their socalled comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers come on ive seen pauly shore movies that are 10 times funnier than the underground comedy movie heres a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named dkman the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen thats it thats the whole joke wow this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch theres a bag lady beauty contest in which were exposed to the horrible sights of bikiniclad middleaged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny its a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satireis truth for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags some of the sketches mightve sounded funny on paper but anybody whos taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably wont be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin whos saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a lowbrow comedy like this for not being funny theyre regarded as stuckup squares i just saw white chicks recently thats another lowbrow politically incorrect comedy but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is its not funny what the writers and directors dont understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesnt work there has to be more just think of the famous scene from theres something about mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list the joke about the semen wasnt just funny because it involved bodily fluids there was a buildup ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didnt go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released a knock is on the door and he has to answer it his date mary is at the door and thats when its revealed that the semen is hanging off bens ear in this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever as jay leno always says this comedy things not so easy is it keep that in mind vince offer cause you werent cut out for this genre the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip lets face it nowadays its hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is subjectivebut this movie shouldnt be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncans fame in movies like armageddon and the green mile there cant be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either nonactors hasbeen actors or bmovie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces but i dont think shes done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee nolin is nothing without baywatch angelyne is the films biggest star keeping in mind duncan wasnt famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who havent heard of herfor good reason usually im in support of extremely lowbudget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this doesnt become a cult classic shouldnt there be a law against distributing crap like this
