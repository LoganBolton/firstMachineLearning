this is the worst movie ive ever seen in my life this is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices ive made in film rentalsbr br i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spenderbr br the skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and lockerroom gags and its such a blatant and poor ripoff of the kentucky fried movie that youll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of vince offer whoever that isbr br unless you are a masochist avoid this pile of rubbish
