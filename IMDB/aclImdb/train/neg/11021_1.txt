hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterwardbr br it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten theres like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops and habits in a church tower like quasimodo only he is much less sympatheticbr br theres a strange love story involved which doesnt have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what we know he misses his mother thats what the first ten minutes were about they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a ok short film now its a portrait of a character who doesnt change he is a guy that stuff happens to the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a jobbr br theres this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character he paints his face dresses in womens clothing and wears a dead badger on his head a badger youve got to see the ending he returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky horror film to kill his dads new wife which he had sex with in the beginning and somehow they thought this wouldnt be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background ive got to admit though im kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose it feels like this mackenzie directorguywhatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school you are so smart thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories you really dug what a wallraff okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book but anywaybr br photowise it is boring a lot of talking heads plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe hallam foe is both a feature and a test film for color blind people or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldnt be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they increased blue so that we really get itbr br im not even gonna comment on the cliché indieohhowhowhowcute drawings they have made in the presentation and all the cute sex stuff going on this whole film is an independent cliché but i do recommend it i laughed more than a few times though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine
