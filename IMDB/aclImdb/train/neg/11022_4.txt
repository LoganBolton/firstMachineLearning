in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe Â– i cant see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeurcreep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of peoples lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kates situation would be repulsed and frightened  she would probably call the policebr br these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallams mother has died and his father married a woman with whom hes been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kates some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issuesbr br forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie whos afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesnt always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the endings plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens
