david mackenzies followup to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feelgood underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psychosexual issues with his dead mother it wants to be gritty realistic and mysterious at the same time it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adultbr br to meet this end the film tries hard to be youthful its poster has handdrawn letters looking like that of juno its original soundtrack is comprised of fastpaced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok just a little misguided but strangely the film is anything but youthfulbr br like young adam this films central mystery concerns a drowned woman in this case hallams mother young adam keeps its mystery quiet contemplative and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come hallam foe does the opposite it foregrounds its characters psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend hallam swiftly interrupts asserting his presence in the household here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the moviebr br the mystery surrounding his mothers drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his fathers girlfriend the audience can never really trust hallam because besides being creepy we think his obsession has led him close to insanity this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable right when hes found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home at first it appearing to be looking for the police then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery elementbr br while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs this movie is in no way mysterious yet it is not blunt either it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues but it adds a very selfconscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite it goes for a soundtrackheavy trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings picks locks and camps out for the sake of voyeurism these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inwarddrawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy giddy or pleasant they are more neutral than anything not propelling the character or story mackenzie makes you understand hallam yet he fails to build common groundbr br he expects you to enjoy hallams trials and tribulations without much ideological justification the film hinges on its audiences perspective on voyeurismthe kind of person who engages in it obviously most people would be disgusted by it and hallam foe realizes that but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions he goes from person to person trying to fill his deep void there is a particularly disturbing line from hallams love interest kate where she drunkenly says i love creepy boys perhaps asking the audience to do the same the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him her motivation remains vague throughout and tries to further us from judging him its not hard to like hallam but it is very hard to participate in his adventure if it is even an adventure at all all the while the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive moodbr br great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act muddy development and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie recently this film was renamed for a us release and for what reason not only is it more unappealing but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title mister
