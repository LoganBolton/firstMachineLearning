once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing i just recently reviewed baby face nelson now ive seen dillinger and ive had itbr br this movie is garbage i dont know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde this movie is far from a classic someone called it brilliant thats an insane thing to say this movie cant get any facts straight and it has the worst casting ive ever seen i dont know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger first of all he looks nothing like him second of all by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31 when oates made this he was 45 you could even tell that hes older than the real dillinger just by looking at him not only was he too old but so was ben johnson as melvin purvisbr br they show baby face nelson die then homer van meter and finally john dillinger john dillinger was killed before both of them the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson not only do the writers not know when they died but they also dont know how they died baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns homer van meter was cornered by the police in st paul and gunned down with machine guns another member of dillingers gang harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie pierpont wasnt shot harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so im not going to go into it again here let me also add that richard dreyfuss portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic theres a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming leave me alone baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought maybe dillinger didnt agree with nelsons bank robbing methods but they never fought nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten they keep calling him lester baby face nelson he was never in his life known by that name nelsons real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood john milius doesnt know anything where the hell did john milius get his information i could probably make a better movie than himbr br finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette by the way billie frechette wasnt even there that night but a girl named polly hamilton was melvin purvis yells johnny dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away they didnt even have to shoot him they were so close that powder burns were found on his face it was murder they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillingers death i could go on and on how the man they killed wasnt john dillinger but ill stop here if you would like to know more check it out herebr br see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want but dont waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie
