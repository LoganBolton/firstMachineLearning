anyone who visited driveins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever moviegoers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles  in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalonannette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouselevel trash like cannibal girls and sugar hillbr br dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drivein filmmaking it is one of those uneven overthetop flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriterdirector john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive careerbr br the 109minute dillinger  epic for aips scope  follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 19334 dillinger is basically a chase film with purviss entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hooverbr br dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around blackandwhite photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillingers strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american lifebr br this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isnt there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly bloodfilled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967s bonnie and clyde but we simply dont get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shootemup persona when its characters could have been explored in detailbr br aside from this the pictures main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film its films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as miliuss screenplay and the films documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldnt have stayed with the facts and written a great story around thembr br warren oatess performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his largerthanlife image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and its really too bad that miliuss screenplay didnt flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a coldblooded killer other than the stereotype of an easygoing girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a brieflyappearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talentbr br as a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgms dvd release for 499 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drivein flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillingers theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drivein enthusiasts the film doesnt really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre its certainly worth checking outbr br  out of 4br br roving reviewer  wwwgeocitiescompauljohnr
