first off i must admit that both films ive seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points my czech isnt bad but having sat through two of his films i wish i hadnt even tried to learn samotari is too cool way too cool its about ten different story lines that weave in and out together thats not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague tiny really the main characters are between 20 and 30 theyve got jobs and only one studies the best character is the young balkan girl her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day thats about it the only great character everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film if you like alright music see this film if you want to laugh at others stupidity see this film if you like irony and dry humor see an original jarmusch not an imitation and under no circumstances see ondriceks film septej whisper that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes
