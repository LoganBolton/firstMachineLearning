i recently watched this film at the 30th gothenburg film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films ive ever had the misfortune to watch dont get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films eg manos Â– hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason vorhees from friday the 13th the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep
