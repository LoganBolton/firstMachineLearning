its interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film but the problem is that its not very good there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didnt bother for any of thembr br rather bland and sometimes downright bad photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you cant expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it its unfair to review the film and compare it to other highbudget films but alas that is what one must do on its own its not very good and compared to others its still not very good but it is not without its good points i liked the plot it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end sometimes in the really dark scenes it managed to build up a creepy feeling as wellbr br however in the end the film fails to impress the characters are pretty much nonexistent and we dont care for any of them any of them might die but its possible to pinpoint the final survivor from very early on
