i love new york is another entry by vh1 mtv networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ebonics speaking craziest contestant  and her mother  and give them a show on this network many will argue this is a show true its not as bad as its previous show flavor of love  but its just as badbr br it reminds me of a skit from the 90s show in living color where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on the love connection dating show and he picked robin givens for a date mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in this show reminds me of thatbr br the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more  i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her  and her mother  to give you a name that is so ghetto youll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv but these are professional reality actors so why botherbr br it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network well you cant hate them for trying to make a buck maybe the wonder is  who would want to be with this woman past an hour or wonder if she and her mothers next show would be on the wwf any way you slice it its a train wreck youve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nilbr br no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately
