all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish how can that be funny of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed but jims character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic mannerbr br and why it that my guess is that its because he should now better jims not a stupid guy he can take care of things and hes got the opportunities to do so but he chooses not to its a conscious choice he makes when he chooses to not play with his kids not go shopping because he doesnt want to buy lady products and its a choice he makes when he puts down his relativesbr br the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to if the cheryl character was a real person she would have left him years ago and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years but alas shes just a catalyst for jims quirky middleclass extreme selfishness
