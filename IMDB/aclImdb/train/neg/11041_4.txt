the show is average it doesnt make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesnt look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like lets pretend im yelling because i shouldnt be too loud on the set br br she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing its annoying you cant really get her personality because she doesnt really produce emotion and doesnt get upset she has this husband whos doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting
