i wish i could say that this show was unusual in its banalitybut it is usual in every wayit has the dumb husbandhis smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic reliefit sorely needs itstale predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack punctuate this noxious mental narcotics nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identifya regular guy just like you and mei live in the southern us so to me this show is just the opposite of escapismdown here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or anotherseeing him on television is brutal overkill
