this is one of the worstwritten movies ive ever had to sit throughbr br the storys nothing new  but its a cartoon so who cares as long as its pretty and fun br br im not going to go as deep as the characterisations or ill be here all day except to say that there arent any the characters change personality whenever its convenient to the plot but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper thumbs down id vote to cut their thumbs offbr br narrow in on an objectprop cut back to character closeup character gives a knowing look which the audience will not even remotely understand repeat that several times with different objectspropsbr br make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around crashing into each other generally raining destruction all over and which could kill them all at any moment  but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmlesslooking almost pastoral green rock in the distance br br the whole thing is a long succession of events actions and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properlybr br this is the plan 9 of cg cartoons except that it doesnt have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watchbr br do yourselves a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies
