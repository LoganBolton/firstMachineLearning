terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction that villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks ive ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music and whered they get their props that ship looks like a milk carton i did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13br br id recommend any film student should watch this flick 5 minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the editors faultbr br its really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around sorry malcom you should have sent a stunt double youre too good an actor for such a stinkbomb
