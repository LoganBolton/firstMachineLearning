a terrible movie containing a bevy of dlist canadian actors who seem so selfconscious about the fact they are oncamera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettablebr br this film is badly written badly edited and badly directed it is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre  but not in a good way mcdowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so  he really has a bad story and script to work with its not even camp enough to be funnybr br i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner and even the subcharacters like eisen with his nasal whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africabr br didnt the director see that the creature looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleskes orange wisps of magic  for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer overlaid with completely derivative special effects was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind br br learn from the mistakes of others  dont even waste your time with this one youll regret it like i did i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
