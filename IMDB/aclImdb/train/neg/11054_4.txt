i find it heartwarming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a lowbudget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it cant muster the filmmaking prowess to pull it offbr br the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesnt take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity  and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horrorbr br the surreal nonsequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon a scruffy and halfmad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her fathers paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirreleating albinobr br part of the movies charm is precisely this brand of bargainbasement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didnt really expect it to come out this way but its good enough  wrap scene blur hopelesslybr br take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drugaddled feverish streamofconsciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her fathers voice as she reads his diary br br while were still talking about a living dead picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one  at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious dark stranger who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of massconsumption criticism in a flesheating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theaterbr br i generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses  how is the absurd to work if its not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks br br the general filmmaking level is also pretty low  after the halfway mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyucks general inability to capture true atmosphere  the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused  and id file messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate  even though its not particularly gory trashy or sleazy
