disappointing and undeniably dull truecrime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last centurys most recognizable degeneratesserial killers released straighttovideo back in early 2003 dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snorefest of a truecrime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was overall 2003s dahmer is one that truecrime buffs everywhere might as well skip because im not kidding when i say that its one of the worst serialkiller biopics ever done its even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straighttovideo trash like gacy bundy ed gein and the night stalker turkeyzero stars
