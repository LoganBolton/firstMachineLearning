dahmer is an interesting film although i wouldnt use horror or thriller do describe it its more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killerbr br jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer who drugged murdered and dismembered his male victims the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and rodney wellplayed by artel kay√†ru br br rodney is almost the more interesting character enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attackbr br i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmers formative years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmers belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victimsbr br the roles are well played but the story is thin
