oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad i mean even uwe boll doesnt make crap like this there is not even a hint of a decent story multilayered characters or attraction its just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a movie i suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it but then again its far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age that theres probably no one that should watch this movie at allbr br take my advice and stay far far away from this movie your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isnt able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to and please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of  ill give it 2 out of 10 and thats exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful theyd deserve a negative ratingbr br and if you decide to watch it anyways remember that i warned you
