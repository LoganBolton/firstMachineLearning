it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of americas most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesnt even come close terrible editing direction bad acting you name it this movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father but thats not nearly enough to save this stinker a 1 out of 10
