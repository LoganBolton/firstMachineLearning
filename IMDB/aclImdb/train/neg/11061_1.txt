curiosity led me to this masterpiece unfortunately i didnt rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that its not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer are you kidding me the man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good and with all the flashbacks and flashforwards i had trouble following the story all in all jeremy renners performance wasnt too bad you can catch him in swat in which he plays a disgruntled excop anyway i would rate this as a 110 it only got a 1 because of renners soso performance there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmers crimes avoid this one
