way to go ace you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror or documentary right this was neither it wasnt close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all it wasnt really morbid or scary or didnt even try to be very disturbingas if you wouldve had to try what the hell was this writerdirector thinking heres one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parents house i think jacobson was actually trying to present or invent the soft side of jdahmer
