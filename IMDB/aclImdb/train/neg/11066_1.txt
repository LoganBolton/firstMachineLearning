prior to watching dahmer i thought no movie could be worse than freddy got fingered i was wrong to sum dahmer up its a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmers encounters with gay men before they were killed there is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about dahmer all youll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything if you have to choose between watching dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours go with the vomiting  it wll be less painful
