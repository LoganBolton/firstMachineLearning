dahmer a young confused man dahmer a confusing movie granted i had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesnt explain why i got so bored by this flickbr br its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and theres no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie the inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time br br we never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmers dreaming the entire thing but you know he isnt since itsbr br based on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it but what happened its not easy to tellbr br i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie ibr br didnt like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended br br
