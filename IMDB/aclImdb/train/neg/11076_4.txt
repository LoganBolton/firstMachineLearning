skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its wellmeaning tone skullduggery simply isnt a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which cant make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into scifi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that youre watching a muddled disorganised moviebr br an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange apelike creatures these primitive longlost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continuedbr br this was a very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like hes in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hydewhite a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective makeup used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuckon hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and thats just not the right idea were meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but thats awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesnt do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless
