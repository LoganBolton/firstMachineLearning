honestly where can i begin this was a low budget horribly acted film it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was the sword fighting scenes werent even sword fights they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at walmart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there it was the sawtooth island movie i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scenebr br oh and the plot of the film the story board the script etcwas a bunch of garbage that i dont even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it but if you happen to stumble upon this moviedo not get it
