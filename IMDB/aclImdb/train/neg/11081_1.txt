while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now 2002 an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction feats like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homers the odysseybr br my beef basically is that i couldnt relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middleaged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didnt find myself saying ack i would have done the same thing it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to highbudget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfishteenagerbitterafterdivorce image changing into the wereabighappyfamilyletsneverseparateagain feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the everpresent selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smartaleck little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character moviebr br i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me dont get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical
