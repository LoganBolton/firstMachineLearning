this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didnt convince me as a whole i am no tyson fan in fact i dont like boxing at all its barbaric obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other upbr br nevertheless i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott as cus damato i dont know how reliable the flick is i havent read books and books about boxing or tyson i dont know anything about the man but it was quite entertainingbr br as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of its charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough
