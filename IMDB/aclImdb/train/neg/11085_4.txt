tyson br br aspect ratio 1331br br sound format stereobr br reverent  though scrupulously fair  account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson given his conviction on a rape charge the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain but paints a wartsandall portrait of his rise to fame the pressures of success and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad constrained by time limits the script gallops through a succession of relevant details alighting briefly on significant events culminating with tysons temporary downfall in 1995 novices will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edels straightarrow approach to the material he portrays tysons life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success in fact the script reserves most of its venom for tysons exwife robin givens characterising her as an ungrateful golddigger who took advantage of his naivety production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character george c scott plays tysons mentor cus damato through acres of gritted teeth and paul winfield was surely born to play don king
