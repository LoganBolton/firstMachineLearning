i had high hopes for this film because i thought clean shaven kerrigans first feature was absolutely terrific the most assuredly cinematic low budget film id ever seenbr br but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or characterbr br is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not hard to tell why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color why does claire accept some johns and not others the filmmaker doesnt seem to knowbr br it feels as if everything is improvised though i understand this wasnt the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentarybr br after the screening i saw kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative it sounded like learned rhetoric i think it was a copoutbr br i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches
