the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isnt really saying what it thinks its sayingbr br in an audacious  i hesitate to use the word inspired  act of street theater vit klusak and filip remunda two student filmmakers from the czech republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store built an entire ad campaign around it  replete with billboards radio and tv spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise  and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day they even built a makeshift fa√ßade to convince people that the store itself actually existedbr br one might well ask why do such a thing well thats a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isnt all that satisfying a one essentially were told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something  even something thats not true  simply through the power of advertising and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real ie higher purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union fair enough  especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising in a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the rusebr br but in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it for it is they themselves and not the goodhearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains or that theyre stupid and gullible because they dont suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real worldbr br no im afraid this smartalecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots and indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick thats been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor im not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their positionbr br im not saying that the movie isnt gripping  something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action  but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return redfaced and emptyhanded to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed
