i have this film out of the library right now and i havent finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although shed pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film its really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicidebr br there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadowbr br who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffanys twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obviousyou sure dont have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cinemusique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at youbr br reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburns chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like annmargret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloidlevel situationsbr br hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesnt take it seriously at all couldnt be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many waysbr br and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomsons oftused phrase losing hisher talent never has made more sensebr br ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburnwho could ask for anything less sandra dees last pitiful film lost from 2 years later a lowbudget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 audrey hepburns accent just sounded silly shed go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculousbr br to think that breakfast at tiffanys was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the worldshe was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuffcorny witless and stiflingbr br i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburns singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffanys and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregationbr br a great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nuns story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who became a truly bad onethats not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilesslywhich all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburns miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill
