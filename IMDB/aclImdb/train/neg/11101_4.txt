i heard and read many praising things about midnight meat train which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original hellraiser that he directed himself but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating the violence is sadistic and extreme which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts but its also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative normally speaking im very proviolence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose the butchering  literally  depicted in midnight meat train is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs and even that isnt fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects there are more shortcomings some even bigger than the pointless gore but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the freezer room for example are literally oozing with nailbiting suspense and macabre atmosphere unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones the plot introduces leon an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train leons right as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer but the killers motivations and behavior suggest theres something far more substantial going on the rails at night midnight meat train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood but director ryûhei kitamura versus godzilla final wars doesnt take full advantage of it all the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and even if clive barker meant to have like this i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale midnight meat train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film but not without defaults its not intended for easily offended viewers but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well
