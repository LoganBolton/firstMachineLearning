i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made if you doubt me please look at my other reviews however for the first time ever i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even overbr br i love bad movies to me ed wood is a genius i thought bloody murder jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good however there is not a single good thing i can say about this filmbr br the plot is basically non existent if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can discern for themselves what the plot might be but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this moviebr br the special effects are badbr br the acting is badbr br the two leads are attractive but thats all there isbr br i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarkingyahoocom to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it i will tell you anythingbr br i love bad movies and i love horror and i love new inventive movies i even love horror porn stuff like hostel which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever madebr br and before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead but actually bought a copy of it
