this was a terrible film there was no story line whatsoever to top it all off when they couldnt explain the blood and gore the only good part  they threw in a few aliens i hate when directors or whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens watch this film if you like but dont say i didnt warn you two things how could vinny say welcome when he didnt have a tongue its a pity mr jones didnt have a bigger role second thing that bugged me why were we shown vinny jones boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role why not i dont like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever in short bad story i wouldnt waste my time  wish id have watched mirrors instead
