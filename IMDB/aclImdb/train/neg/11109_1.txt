i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this i havent seen such a bad movie for yearsomg this was a really bad movie splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary nearly funny blood scenes if you didnt like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween 2007 well this is 10 time worse the story remind me rl stine goosebumpsbr br i cant tell about the acting since the script was so terribleclich√© all the time why i must write 10lines i never understood thisbr br here comes spoilersbr br the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice actually those people are just missing and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy and as usual no one believes him what a surprise in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher
