one hour eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame that was right after hopalong chris lybbert drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidygreat bar 20 gimmick which didnt translate into anything at all obviously the name coppola in the credits couldnt do anything to guarantee success here even with more than one listedbr br if you make it to the end of the film youll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did what exactly was the hook with the gloves whats up with the rodeo scenario who was the stranger supposed to represent why did they make this film br br i could probably go on but my energys been drained look theres already a western called the gunfighter from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad that one i can recommend
