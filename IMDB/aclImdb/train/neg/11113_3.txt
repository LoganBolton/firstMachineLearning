i often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about  or i write the review to balance unwarranted raves i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fastforwarding not only through dull clichéd dialog but even dull clichéd musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film  unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation  is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thoughtprovoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but cant carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal theyre both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty onenote the best part of the film to me are june havers beautiful costumes and great body
