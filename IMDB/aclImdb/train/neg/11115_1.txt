one previous reviewer called this film pure visual joy i am wondering if she saw the same film that i did high art had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since seven one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the clich√© of going to a bb for their first time of course before they do that one has to watch opiumden parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types the girlfriendboyfriend at start who are well aware theyre going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now what did she do retire at age twenty
