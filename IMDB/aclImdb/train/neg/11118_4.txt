this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fastmoving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc funny thing is you probably couldnt make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police br br nonetheless woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipesbr br snipes had a lot of funny putdown lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film  which doesnt bother a lot of people  is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters that includes woodys girlfriend played by rosie perez there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i cant honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
