you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of jeopardybr br the saddest thing about white men cant jump is that it had tremendous potential for several years i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone a film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men cant job left something to be desiredbr br the movies sequence of events is cyclical first billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated most stories build up to a climax of some kind but the climax i saw was just another sequence in this repetition this case being billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketballbr br in order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well apparently the writers of white men cant jump forgot this rule as the plot can be summarized as billy needs to pay the bills i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies but  im sorry  this was just plain awful i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartmentbr br despite all this white men cant jump is a successful film apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them others im sure were lured by the big names playing the leading roles this leaves me to wonder if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse would anyone have bothered watching this movie i really dont think sobr br ill give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the jeopardy scene which kept me awake for a few minutes thanks trebek
