ill say this muchthis director is all about raw imagesthings most of us are not ready to confront headon images of sex suicide murder and people relieving themselves are constantly bombarding the viewer which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release although i dont think that i could ever see this movie again i will say that the director does have a good eye there were some really nice shots and picture moments in the film the fans the wire fish in their hair but the story left me needing more strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves what the heck did we just seebr br note if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easilydont see this film
