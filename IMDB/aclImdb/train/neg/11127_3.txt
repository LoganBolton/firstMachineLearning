im not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wrights novel which the movie is based onbr br we read the novel this past summer for ap english 12 and just watched the film during periodic notetaking and checking of the clock i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning of course the sky was completely clear and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie and then write a 5paragraph essay on itbr br wrights novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it silvers movie turned a murderer into a victim which is not what wright wanted see how bigger was born 454br br im going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness in raphael lamberts words unsullied skip the movie and read the book the 1986 adaptation is not thoughtprovoking materialbr br  sigh now i have to write the essay
