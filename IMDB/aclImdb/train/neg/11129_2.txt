watch the 1936 version as personally annoying i find charles boyers voice hes more of a match to pay cosmopolitan depressed rudolfi mean omar sharif tries but notoo cute and vibrant catherine denueve sp besides being too old looks nothing like marienothing she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashionbr br the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role theyre playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief and look up pictures of the empress theres more than a passing resemblance as historically empress elisabeth wasnt involved that much in rudolfs life
