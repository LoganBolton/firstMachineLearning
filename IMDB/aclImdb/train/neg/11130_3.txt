despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky or think hes a tired relic from the 1960s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist although i could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings so stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 911 i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so whats all the fuss aboutbr br for a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the new york times according to the dvds case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldnt even want to watch what a william f buckley could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things hed say rather than being on linguistics so maybe thats the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertiseÂ… even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that its difficult to separate all of the jumble his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that 911 was a great thing for the chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since thenbr br not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background its assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that and slackjawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor filmmaking by director and editor will pascoe who in the dvds filmmaker statement shows hes yet another uncritical acolyte of chomskys other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no boundsbr br given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomskys lectures at mcmaster university in ontario canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals as example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims trilateralists run the world and that peoples fear of crime is yet another cabals result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great sponsors of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up speciesmixing impregnation centers up in idahobr br in his simpleminded world without grays chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals in short chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this films end he warns be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didnt like no matter how barbarous their crimes and antiintellectual their posit please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd
