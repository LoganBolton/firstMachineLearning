let me start by saying that id read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect still i was surprised by just how bad it was br br i am a big werewolf fan and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one most of them have subpar effects poor acting and weak storylines at best rehashed from earlier films so far with the possible exception of some of the later howling series films this is the worst of the lotbr br first the story its been quoted several times in reviews on this site so i wont go into specifics however it is very obvious that the writers had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves above such fare they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos thats fine but a nonhorror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted tv news footage for example never pans away from the reporter to closeup on someone in the crowd behind them give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign and thats just the tip of the icebergbr br as for effects i have never seen a less believable werewolf id have been happier with lon chaney jr in crepe hair the beast they used look a great deal like well like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics and i know that many people have already criticized the cg but my god it was awful one scene features a woman changing and starts with a completely cg version of the actress nude but for some reason without nipples my first thought was hey why is one of the characters from reboot turning into a silly looking werewolfbr br anyway i like to look for positives in any film and there were a few the cinematography was passable the film was shot alldigital which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the worlds most well madeup homeless woman and kane hodder as the title bad guy also the yellow power ranger got all growed up and well damn and if youre looking for skin theres some pretty tasty examples this ends the malepig segment of the reviewbr br overall if you want a good werewolf film try an american werewolf in london the original the howling dog soldiers or even the wolfen though that ones got more wolf than were if youre a lycanthrope completest then take a gander otherwise give this one a miss
