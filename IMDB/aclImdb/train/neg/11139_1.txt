there isnt much to say about this film it is horriblebr br the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolfs is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and therebr br cgi is something you wouldnt like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomitbr br the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth rentingbr br just stay away of this
