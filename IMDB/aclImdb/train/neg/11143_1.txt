hi im a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least althou i wonder why i havent heard of it beforebr br first of all the movie starts with tits lots of tits tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shotsbr br so about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares hes your average everyday biker not even supertough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than youve ever faced before just by describing her a tattooed bikertype of a guy pretty original i even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes special effect i mean my god that letsplantreddotsoneyeswithcomputer effect has been used since the seventies it looks plain ugly here and dont get me started with the werewolf 3dcgi as said before like an bad and old video gamebr br and finally as i do like werewolf films like i said they prettymuch always build a werewolflegend of their own darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybridwerewolves and the ancient bloodline but it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts randomslashing which just doesnt make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they arent even gonna play by them aplus the wolfpointofview shots are made with a sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls just add growling noises and youve got a super werewolf effect the gore is partially ok but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesnt do the trick for mebr br truly who gives money to make these heaps of junk straighttovideo horrortitles they arent even funnykind of bad movies just sad
