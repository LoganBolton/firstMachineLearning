this flick reminded me of those lame erotic thrillers i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was 13 id label this flick softercore since there is just no simulated bump and grinder there is however a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club we see kane hodders keester or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munsters for a costume 13 year old boys rejoicebr br other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi ive seen in years the shots look like fmvs from the video game resident evil in terms of quality the wolf is too bad to be explained and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way way too many timesbr br the plot and acting make no sense there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybridwerewolves the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do look human change to a wolf an kill people the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly cant find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches once more this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched met or even saw as best i can tell the mate doesnt know shes a werewolf and shes fighting the transformation or somethingbr br youd think itd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but well they did want quality lowend werewolfism go rent dog soldiers want a ton of ta this is your flick
