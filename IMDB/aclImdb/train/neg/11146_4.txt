well no not really its not really a good movie but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be i really didnt feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for the plot is ok nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty the directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem there was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasnt all that hot all in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film ive ever seen and if youre bored a genre fan check it out sometime id even watch it againbr br bonus fact for horror geeks kane hodder jason vorhees in a few of them plays the werewolf
