this is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line lets bring back samaire armstrong having seen her work on the oc i know she can do better then find a better script and budgetbr br the special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen onscreen and samaire armstrongs alertchanging into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to changefinal fantasys humans as well as pixars made these laughable think of the figure as a nude barbie dollbr br the story of was interesting though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new as it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of humankind should the two lines mate the subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spelllike manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past br br bring in a better script and direction and id come back again
