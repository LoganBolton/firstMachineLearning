darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie samaire armstrong who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary tippi hedren is killed by a werewolf you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america  there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley ryan olosio who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself  that a socalled dark prince werewolf kane hodder wants to mate with her  create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world or something like that understandably josie has a hard time believing it that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes its up to werewolf cop steve to save josie the day  the worldbr br coexecutive produced  directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didnt really do anything for me the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show  then theres a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence its pretty much down hill all the way im afraid for a start its slow going its dull its predictable  its populated with highly annoying characters who come out with lots of bad dialogue  do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they dont i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead the script is dumb  doesnt explain itself why has josie never turned into a werewolf before is she really the only one why cant this dark prince find another female werewolf there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about halfway through but you get the idea anyway as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the leastbr br director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original  doesnt really improve the film as a spectacle now lets talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi  its among the worst looking cgi ive ever seen seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics its easily the worst werewolf transformation ive ever seen an american werewolf in london 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally lightyears ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf who says special effects have improved over the years the animatronic puppet effects arent much better either although at least theres something psychical on screen the gore isnt up to much after a gory opening kill theres some blood splatter  plenty of dead bodies but not much else thres a fair amount of female nudity if thats your thing but dont get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it is it really worth itbr br technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever its reasonably well made  it at least seems to have production values the acting is what youd expect reallybr br darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves  clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations i didnt think it was as bad as some but its like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said  done theyre both horrible still
