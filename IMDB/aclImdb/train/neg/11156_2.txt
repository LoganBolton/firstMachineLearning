dark wolf quick review lets get right to it this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sht on it its just an awful movie its an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80s high school drama film whats worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf kane fcking hodder someones trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film careerbr br anyway former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too its kind of a crappy cop drama with the worlds worst looking werewolf in it but it does have moments of nearrampant nudity but thats about all want to know more okay the werewolf is generally an uglylooking black blur zipping around the screen and when were privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence were presented with something that resembles a fullmotion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation the first playstation the cg animation is really that primitive only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit 210br br wwwresidenthazardcom
