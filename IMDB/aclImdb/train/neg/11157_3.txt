hip erotic wickedly sexy  whatever its the terminator with werewolvesbr br no seriously the cop saves the girl waitress from the big monster and refers to himself as her protector the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese  theres a massacre in a police precinct  the bad guy is muscular with red eyes  and it even contains dialogue along the lines of you said it yourself he wont ever stop never the dire script comes from a firsttime screenwriter who thank god hasnt sold anything since this and its all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedmanbr br the movie opens in a strip bar always a good sign and a meanlooking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason pursued by three cops one of them is black and shock horror hes the one who gets killed in the first five minutes the film goes downhill for the next hour or so then picks up a little with some decent action sequences before rounding it all up with an abysmal endingbr br for the most part the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director whos willing to settle for less if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio along with some of the supporting cast shows signs of talent darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder  famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the friday the 13th movies hes decent enough especially considering he isnt used to speaking rolesbr br its become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former power rangers actresses and its unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene  anyway the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good and the design of the wolf isnt bad at allbut the cgi is bad just plain bad i mean seriously if you cant reach some level of realism  why bother just throw a little extra money into the makeup aside from the terrible script this movie does have its moments many of which are unintentionally funny its good for a laugh if you dont have anything better to do but just dont spend any money on it please
