this kind of inspirational saccharine is enough to make you sick it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess youd need such prompting to feel if youre stupid enough to watch a film as simpleminded and sappy as this streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if its just thata display switched on and off like a light because i cant for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film even though its based on a true story and an inspirational one at that im sure the setup execution and performances play like a thirdrate tv movie or halfwitted high school drama
