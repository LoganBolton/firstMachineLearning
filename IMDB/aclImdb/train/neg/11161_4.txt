nacho libre 2006 br br directed by jared hess br br starring jack black ana de la reguera héctor jiménez  darius rose br br mpaa rating pg13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog br br say what you will about it i know some people who despise it to no end but i have always thought that napoleon dynamite was a funny movienot the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless jack black is also a very funny manirritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree so i was very happy to hear that jared hess the writer and director of napoleon dynamite and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie this plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as saturday night live or possibly even mad tv would have worked flawlessly unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this onejoke comedy falls flatbr br nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord feeling shunned by the entire monastery nacho black now the monasterys cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler as the monasterys finances hit an alltime low nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monasterys orphanage this plot sounds so sweet and caring it seems like the perfect movie for jack black look what he did with school of rock after all well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie it is again hollywoods way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course for all i know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but dont expect to get an award for putting it in your movie a sevenyearold could make up the same jokebr br the performances in nacho libre are actually good jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical unfortunately this movie just wasnt enough for him it didnt give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before but now i can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well héctor jiménez who plays nachos bumbling partner esqueleto kept me laughing continuously he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack blacks darius rose who plays an orphan named chancho didnt have many lines but what can i say i just enjoyed him he was adorable the rest of the cast did their job it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a subpar moviebr br nacho libre just does not work its plot is stretched far too thin the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just dont work i very rarely laughed and if i did it was because of jack black or another member of the cast and that leads me to the bright side of nacho libre yes the cast this cast was justwell for lack of a better word they were on they all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script after jared hesss napoleon dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie i was surprised to find myself so often bored with nacho libre something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was all i know is that nacho libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless there is a small reason to watch if only to watch jack black work but if you are not a fan of jack black then avoid this movie like the plague i like black but i am done with this movie and with this reviewbr br final thought yikes this is jared hesss surprisingly disappointing followup to his hysterical napoleon dynamitebr br overall rating 410 c
