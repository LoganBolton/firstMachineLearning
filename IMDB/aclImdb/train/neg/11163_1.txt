we loved school of rock and jack black we couldnt wait to go and see this movie it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out my husband hated it too the only funny parts were in the trailers my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money the writing was awful it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended the movie wasnt that long but to us it seemed like an eternity the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts but there werent save you money and your time
