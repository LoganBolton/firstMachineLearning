i mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie its stupid ridiculous and just not funny at allbr br since i saw the preview i knew it wasnt going to be a great movie i just didnt think it was gonna be that badbr br what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie when the actors didnt have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny now we find ourselves with movies like this one borat little men scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny partsbr br just skip this piece of garbagebr br ps sorry for my english
