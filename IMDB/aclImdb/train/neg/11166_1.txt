im sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isnt you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single departmentbr br i just sat there through most of the movie thinking is this supposed to be funny and this is the guy from tenacious d right the truth is this film has nothing to offer at all its a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction youll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesnt i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up it didnt 90 minutes later id barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painfulbr br its like remember years ago when youd see anything with your fave actor in it even some of their really early pap from before they were famous and youd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop yeah its like thatbr br ive enjoyed some of jack blacks earlier movies like shallow hall and im really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man if you do this to us again jack im gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something at the least give you a serious talking tobr br i know its a clich√© but this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen and for so many reasons
