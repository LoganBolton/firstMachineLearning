jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing but in this moviebr br besides the direction writing lack of plot constant mugging aided and abetted by constant straighton camera shots and a 050 joke batting average it was still an utter waste of time the idea sounds promising but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction ive seen this side of youtubebr br i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively while thats no doubt true i really dont think this movie is meant to be racist i think thats its more a result of a creative team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera hey look its an ugly mexican laugh people please for the love of all things tenacious laughbr br but put the racism charges aside when you get down to it its anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended imo
