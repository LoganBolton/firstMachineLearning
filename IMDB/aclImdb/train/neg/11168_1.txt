 a mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something br br i went to see this movie because it was about nonwwf wrestling and so i thought it might be funny it wasnt it is excruciating to watch embarrassing any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered br br i admit i dont like jack black anyway after this i have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed the only thing i can come up with where he was ok was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in high fidelity jack black is one of those awful relentless flatout hamitup knockabout guys like the little fat one in abbot  costello or jerry lewis who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny br br it is not even slapstick its just irritating its not even stoopid its just stupidbr br i heard good things about napoleon dynamite too but if this is anything to go by i wont be rushing out to find it on dvd
