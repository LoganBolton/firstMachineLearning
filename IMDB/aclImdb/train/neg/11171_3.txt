very much a film from the times  extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast the two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for menbr br otoole is riveting whenever he speaks unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery alastair sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underusedbr br the film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of british fascism and fascist sympathies such as the casual appearance of the mosley graffiti that many people today are unaware of too many of todays films about wwii paint the allies as allgood and the axis as allevil when history tells us people are far more complicated than thatbr br this would be a good movie for when youre recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex if you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize this is the movie for you
