2002s undeservedly popular i love the 80s is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting popculture mess of a show that was the first in a longline of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 which was at one time the only real musicoriented channel left on tv i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter i forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever out of sheer morbid curiosity id guess thats what youd call it i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a looksee anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap at least i can honestly say that i wasnt a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basementlevel to begin with the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980s and what was and wasnt culturally significant or popular which is what i was expecting to see but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really godawful noname comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyesmore like lackthereof if you ask me its pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at socalled humor that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid oneliner they shot off one after another altogether i have no problem in saying that i love the 80s wasis trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore
