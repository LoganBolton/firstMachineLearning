saw this movie in an early preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was from the very beginning the audience was groaning over pacinos awful southern accent poor al looked really really haggard and i cant decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist or perhaps he just didnt get any sleep before coming to the set much worse than pacinos close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot early in the film we are given indications that pacinos character is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended later however we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking effeminate man with the ridiculous accent the worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of reshoots and editing but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters
