in what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 ive had to endure in a long time al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure not his usual typecasting which was nice but his character was just truely pathetic someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy but in this movie we needed someone to like and for some reason every character in the picture said i dont know why i like you eli to al pacinos chracter and i couldnt even come close to liking himbr br all the other actors played their usual styles tea leoni richard schiff and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films and kim basinger wasnt even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kindbr br the movies story had no momentum most scenes never driving the story forward but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anticlimactic ending it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the storybr br whats the point of the film daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe once hollywood has you you cant get out yeah right and thats why so many people get fired in hollywood
