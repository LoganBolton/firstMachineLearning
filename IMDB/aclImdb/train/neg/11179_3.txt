much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accentbr br the plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels and then retreatsbr br kim basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other theres no energy therebr br tea leone on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment
