i dont know what this movie is about really its like a students art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main characters apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think its about but i wouldnt wish this level of hell on anybody else
