the only good thing about people i know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in the first big turnoff i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot the story overall is a real bore and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awakebr br this movie will surely bore you as wellavoid at all costs
