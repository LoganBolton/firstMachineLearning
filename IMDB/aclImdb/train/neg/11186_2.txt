i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off characters dont seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tirebr br i shut it off when they go to ask somethinga demon or something i stopped caringa ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body questionbr br 0 out of  stars
