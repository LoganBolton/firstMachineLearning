this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actually paid Â£350 to watch this steaming turd of a movie incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that dont seem to have any relevance to the overall film like when heath ledgers priest partner gets nailed to a wall by a ghostwhat was the point in that scene answers on a postcard pleasebr br i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for its entire running time i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film againbr br this should be cast into imdbs bottom 100 hopefully my vote of 110 will help it on its way
