the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts  demons named brother dominic francesco carnelutti is found dead cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier heath ledger is contacted by topbrass cardinal driscoll peter weller who asks him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominics death along with his girlfriend mara willims shannyn sossamon  fellow priest thomas garrett mark addy alex travels to italy to delve into his mentors death as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a sin eater someone who absorbed others sins  lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully  that the church wasnt happy about his activities alex must do whats right even if it goes against what he believesbr br also know under the title the sin eater this american german coproduction was written produced  directed by bian helgeland  didnt really do that much for me if im honest  i usually am honest that is anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but its throughly predictable excruciatingly dull  boring really silly at times  it takes itself far too seriously the whole concept is daft  while it thinks its clever with its oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up  brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious  lazy way to end things theres the usual religious themes here morality sin forgiveness faith belief prophecys blah blah blah you know the sort of thing then theres the twists which arent hard to see coming theres the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen corruption greed evil etc you know the sort of clich√©d hollywood ideals  themes that get reused every time it deals with the church the order has nothing new to say  as a serious piece of filmmaking it sucks a lot im not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to as a diehard horror fan i didnt see much horror in this at all as a thriller its less than thrilling as a mystery its too predictable  theres nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest  for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as its as exciting  actionpacked as the average episode of sesame street 1969  present harsh maybe but its what i thinkbr br director helgeland does an ok job the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme  it all looks a bit drab grayish  dull for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements in fact there arent any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason dont ask forget about any gore or violence as there isnt any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable according the imdbs trivia section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they arent exactly brilliant as it stands nowbr br i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about 28000000 which is a hell of a lot of money  i just cant see where it all went apart from the sets  production design which are good the whole film looks  feels very average  utterly forgettable the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foulmouthed comic relief irritates a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than thisbr br the order i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much misses all of its intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as im concerned  is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so dont do it not recommended
