ok i didnt have high expectations but this film descending into depths i could not imaginebr br the plot as it were involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater the sin eater allows for catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui nevermind that this makes no sense since then a baptist could give you salvationwell move onbr br ill layout the plot wo giving much away the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate he brings with him a mental patient im not making this up who shot him during an excorism and who loves him not one lick of this btw is explained a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal they get to rome find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film meet with a bondage gear sm antipope that the drunk irish guy knows not explained and who gives information by killing people oh btw hes a bad guy so he has an industrialtechno soundtrack and thenumm seriously im not sure the plot meanders about heath chills with the sin eater flies to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then all off camera the antipope falls and the film endsbr br about 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened by the end something has happened but you cant be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or offscren youre really feeling cheated
