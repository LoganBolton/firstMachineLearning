this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about gigli that ben and jen flop earlier this summer the order was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot now im a heath ledger fan 10 things i hate about you a knights tale and particularly his supporting role in monsters ball but my man needs to find himself a better agent keep accepting scripts like the order and four feathers and hes going to be on the fast track to movie oblivionbr br here are the problems i had with the film firstly the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with well much of anything plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope while mildly interesting did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best secondly please dont insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory we had manufactured angst manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of matrix reloaded with skullnumbing techno music rather than developing character these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were a halfhearted attempt at putting popcornchewing adolescents in the seats thirdly and most importantly this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept we have scandal we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play why then do we learn almost nothing about anyones background we learn a little about alex but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past and alex is the most developed if you can call it that character in the entire filmbr br as the cliche goes nowadays if youre going to see one movie this year make sure its not this one theres about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who im rather fond ofbr br 1 out of 10 im disappointed file this one firmly under had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing heath my man go back to monsters balllike cameos they really suit you
