i shouldnt even review this movie since its not actually a horror movie  and thus not worthy of dr cheeses attention at least its not horror in the usual sense its certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap thats why i turned it off after the first four hours imagine my surprise then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed yep thats right in plain terms this movie is boringbr br the order had lots of flaws not all of them unique in particular it seems to me the main problem with the religious subgenre of horror films is hollywoods unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox just ask william peter blatty in fact without orthodoxy films like this are just an anythinggoes smorgasbord of the filmmakers usually dull and illogical imaginationsbr br think about it if someone made a movie ostensibly about say physics but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot the same goes for these sorts of moviesbr br in other words the orderand many similar movies before it invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions unsurprisingly the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growingbr br avoid this steaming pile
