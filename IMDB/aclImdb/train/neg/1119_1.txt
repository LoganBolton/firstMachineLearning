even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics its still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good jokefirst off jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor mans gerard depardieunaturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that the poor mans box office poisonreally that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisiewhat am i saying it isnt lets just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasnt sharp enough satire is a tricky thingif it isnt sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke insteadi think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way eitherfor a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel filmvery sharp satirebr br potential spoiler alertbr br really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbés character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of controlthough im guessing he didnt cast jeroen krabbé because hes the worst actor and every character hes played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except hes incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well i just dont see it so you understand the dilemma im faced with here right it is the worst film ever because hes supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th mans deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhovens reputation as a good director etc etc
