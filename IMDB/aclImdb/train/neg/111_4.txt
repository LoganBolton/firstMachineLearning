my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actorsactresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasnt that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburns last movies ill always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here
