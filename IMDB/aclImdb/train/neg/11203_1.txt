the screenwriter poorly attempted to recreate the exorcist but put in some blahblah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking aboutbr br they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thoughtprovoking and slowpacedwithoutactionbecause its an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and theres some mumbo jumbo about the sineater movie was originally going to be titled sineater lame concept but the movie took the sineater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sineaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesybr br nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemarys baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mindnumbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
