raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thanks to his affection for his friends wife angela lansbury this was a full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his castingbr br there isnt all that much else here thats interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious theres an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter whos also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward its frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films ive seen him in theres no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burrs character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesnt notice when she comes into the room i guessbr br a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv
