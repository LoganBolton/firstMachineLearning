i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go this movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the nextbr br the 4th man is about an alcoholic writer named reve who has visions of his inpending danger he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is to put it plainer reve likes the dutch sausage so reve concocts a plan to seduce christines boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him but its later discovered that christine has had 3 previous husbands who she all murdered now reve and christines boyfriend could be the 4th man the storyline makes sense with no plot holes the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts basically this isnt my cup of teabr br the movie opens with reve getting out of bed in just a tshirt so in the very beginning you get to see reves lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum plus theres a lot of blood more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combinedbr br not that i have anything against shocking scenes but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking the whole movie is revolved around the shock valuebr br so if any of this is your cup of tea watch this movie otherwise stay far far far far far away from this one my mind is still scarred
