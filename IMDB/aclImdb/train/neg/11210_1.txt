i read john everinghams story years ago in readers digest and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it as far as im concerned landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more closeups of landons puss than should be allowedbr br this movie reflects everinghams story as much as little house on the prairie reflects the books is was based on its just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair
