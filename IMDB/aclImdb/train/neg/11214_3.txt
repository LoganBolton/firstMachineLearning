i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago first im going to say that it looks great cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks i would not call this a horror movie putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie theres no mystery theres no suspense you know who did it the entire time br br its a drama you know whats going on with both sides the entire movie the acting was okay i guess but nothing specialbr br and the tagline revenge can be deadlyreallythey should have check how many hundreds of horrorthriller movies have that exact same taglinebr br it pains me to say some of this but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and i know they dont want people blowing smoke up their ass so i give my honest opinion
