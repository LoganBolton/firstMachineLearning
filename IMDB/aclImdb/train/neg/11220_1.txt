for a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievablethe plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and its the worst clich√©d ending ive seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadnt been so painful to begin with i was numb from the very first scene  one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting ive seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word
