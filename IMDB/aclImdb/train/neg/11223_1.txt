i watched the movie and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience the language would put to shame the street loafersbr br the plot a father forcing none of his son to marry seems farfetched br br the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble mindeds attentionbr br and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first lookbr br hope it saves your time
