im kinda torn on dark angel the film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pinup to ever live  but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless i cant really see what the motivation or point of this film is  as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative  so those who dont know much about bettie arent gonna know much more after watching dark angel eitherbr br the film basically chronicles the last few years of betties career in bondage modeling almost the entire film is comprised of reenactments of some of betties more famous photoshoots and loops these reenactments take up literally 75 of the films runtime and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person the film touches briefly on her shortlived legitimate acting pursuits and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious  but all of this is pretty much glossedover in favor of showing long and drawnout reenactment scenesbr br dark angel isnt a horrible film  theres just no substance to it the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots  upclose its a nogo the other thing that irritated me is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots  the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits the film itself is obviously extremely lowbudget but does what it can set and costumewise within its limitations  so no gripes from me there the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved in fact  the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaws real name is dukey flyswatter no joke  check the cast list cant say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her and if you are that bad off  then you need to seek treatment anyway410
