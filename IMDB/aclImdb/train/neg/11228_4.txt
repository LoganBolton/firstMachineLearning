the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it plods back and forth between vignettes of betties story and recreations of the klaw short films while the klaw recreations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stagey but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thoughtout to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel
