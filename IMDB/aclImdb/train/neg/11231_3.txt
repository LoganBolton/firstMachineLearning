i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level its boring the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls it should have been 65 minutes the best thing about the dr jekyll is mr hyde who isnt seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimoreanbrits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a backwater stage play committed to videobr br noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead its just a lame retread
