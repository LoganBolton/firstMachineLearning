it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there   the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop
