as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values arent bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbingbr br the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how regressive it is in its view of women has the writer been living under a rock br br although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldnt suggest this movie to anyone its terrible its an embarrassment to the city its named after
