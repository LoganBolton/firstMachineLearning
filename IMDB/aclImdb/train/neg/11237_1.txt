i went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film sadly thats about all i got the story covers familiar territory the high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this wellworn theme though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling the sexism of the film was blatantwomen are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married procreating or both though this was couched as a postfeminist choice  worse still was the racismthe shrill jewish mother the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty tormenting the class geek we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen
