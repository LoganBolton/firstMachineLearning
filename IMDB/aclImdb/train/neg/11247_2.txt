this movie was way overhyped a lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the 2 dont mix very well in this movie even with special effects you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying its the greatest movie ever done its just crap on a stick it also didnt help that the story line was sooo crappy i dont understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and i also dont understand how actorsactresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this its almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine printit will all be done on a computer this was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary im very upset with myself for paying money to see this whatever you do dont waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow
