a gave it a 2 instead of a 1 awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork but that wasnt enough to save itbr br the sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies nothing new there i can see there were some hattips to other old classic movies ok no problem with thatbr br but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleepbr br the story line and the script of this movie was awful the characters two dimensional slow moving some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring i couldnt recommend it
