sky captain is possibly the best awful movie ive seen in a long while rife with amazing cg and special effects studded with an alist cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi and racing along with an overused but indiana jonesesquire storyline this should have been a great movie to watchbr br should have being the key term here of coursebr br jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of overtheshoulder heartmelting smirks but you cant make something out of nothing and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks cant save the movies stone dialogue if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said good boy dex just one more time i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me gwyneth paltrow as polly perkins is nothing less than nerve grating her nasal whining and notquitesarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30s comic book heroine who knows i expected more from her an example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late 90s flick the phantom starring kristy swanson and billy zane rent the movie and youll know what i meanbr br giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch ill admit it in just a few short scenes both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry twodimensional castmatesbr br the plot and steady story progression were old boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years the pace is rapidfire in the first half of the movie and a snails pace in the second giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film but to figure out who the key villain is as well the pairing is rather clich√©d also polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterlyended romance and their story isnt so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film nobodys surprised and nobody really cares eitherbr br props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout but sky captain despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on its face not even worth the 275 i paid to get into the theater
