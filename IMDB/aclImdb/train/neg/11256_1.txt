what a waste of time ive tried to sit through sky captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes i start doing something else  anything else its a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a firsttime director because its stiff and i wanted to love it i love scifi the old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests she told me theyd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie lets not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes paltrows performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad  it couldve worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky captains director will keep getting work even after this dreck its commerce not art
