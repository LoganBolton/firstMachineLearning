i gave 1 to this film i cant understand how ettore scolaone of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantialboring and not interesting too longtoo boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film
