this movie should be called plan 9 from joseph smith i think its weirdness is underappreciated the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlichs the population bomb 1968 and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of heavenly fathers gods plan and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad get itbr br this version was filmed in 1989 which is confusing its utah so it looks and feels like 1983 the play was actually written in 1973 and of course the theology is part 1840s part battlestar galactica some of the action takes place on earth and some in the preexistence an aimless romperroom where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries losing their shot at celestial glorybr br it is as stagey as they come but dont let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the cool kids are all into population control presumably counseling their parents not to have any more children having big families was at the time the play was written the cultural norm in the lds community and more importantly considered part of gods plan the church has since done a 180 and have made family planning a choice of the parents and large families are much less the cultural norm now making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modernday mormon mootbr br ahhh but its really only as good as the music there are some catchy tunes here that just wont let this movie die the 1970s death it was predestined for the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there wink and the tough cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica so cheers to all that gather the family around make some jello shooters and enjoy the showbr br
