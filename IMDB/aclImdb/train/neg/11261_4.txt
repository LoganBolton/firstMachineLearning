to start with i have to point out the fact that youre gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour yeah some things happen but you dont know why or what for when you finally figure things out you just realize that its nothing but a twisted soad opera dealing with mature prostitutes dead mothers illegitimate sons the characters are rather poor and the actors specially the young ones dont help that much to makeem look credible only marisa paredes stands out but shes a superb actress no matter if the movie is pure rubbishbr br the only positive things to say about frío sol de invierno is that débutant pablo malo seems to have good intentions and hes filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense well maybe the next timebr br my rate 410
