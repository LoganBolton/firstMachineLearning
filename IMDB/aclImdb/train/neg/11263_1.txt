for shame for shame that a fine actor such as joseph fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel the movie was not only bad but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality the plot was there one seemed to go no where the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances i gave up about 34 of the way through and turned it off a 1 for awful only because there is nothing lower dont waste your time on this one youll not miss anything
