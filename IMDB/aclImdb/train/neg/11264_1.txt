i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as the worst film i have ever seenbr br even if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour filmbr br the simple answer is  they didnt characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches its climax you dont care what happens to any of thembr br i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happenedbr br they even change the true meaning of the books title rancid aluminium by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool titlebr br a real mess of a film from start to finish
