i rented this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner hard to follow strange editing disjointed storyline the characters mumble all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time i just couldnt get into it and didnt care what happened to the characters  not even ian holm could save this film unless you need a cure for insomnia id skip it 310 and thats being generous
