this is a truly abysmal lock stock clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadnt have paid good money for it id have turned it off after 10 minutes not the worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a Â‘movie i use the term loosely gummo i feel like suing that so called director for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen stuff like this reminds hollywood that they dont have a monopoly on truly awful films
