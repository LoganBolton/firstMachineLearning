there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesnt help with the major downsides to the movie i never understand why directors ask actorsactresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they cant convince fiennes just cant do irish and fitzgerald isnt much better at russian when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing as the for the major problemthe plotwas there one i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldnt wait for the film to endit was ridiculous save 90 minutes of your life and dont watch this movie
