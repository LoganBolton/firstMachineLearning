i usually try to construct reasonably wellargued critiques of films but i can not believe this got past the script stage the dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is scrappy at bestbr br i dont remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad joseph fiennes pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it startedbr br the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage
