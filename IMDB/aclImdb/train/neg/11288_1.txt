in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and king arthur on dvds chosen by others for an evenings entertainment and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern moviewatching public totally lacks discrimination and is content as long as they get action both movies were utter rubbishbr br whatever happened to character development whatever happened to meaningful dialogue whatever happened to acting and when watching something that vaguely purports to be historical whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy some realistic idea of the political map of the time even some slight flavour of the era especially in its social attitudes why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that little was known of the dark ages not so considerable amounts are known with much learned scholarship on the era but these jokers simply couldnt be bothered to do any homeworkbr br i only wish i could vote 010
