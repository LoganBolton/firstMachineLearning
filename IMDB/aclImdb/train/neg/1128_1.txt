this movie was one of the worst ive ever seen pure drivel how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine or have empathy for her is beyond me i felt i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder just terriblebr br in its most generous light this can be seen as an attempt at producing and art film  except i could not for the life of me find any art in it at allbr br if this woman had lived in todays world she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with antipsychotic medications that or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her  and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress  speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort
