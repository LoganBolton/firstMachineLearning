this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so selfevidently a bad thing that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts  all thats missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking whered you hear that or that cant possibly be true  yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless em the regular folks in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the filmmakers but equally fairly its a condition shared by the movies rock starsbr br as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music ive enjoyed and im sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor nash seems to be trying too hard  he looks like he cant possibly believe the things hes being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever stand and fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when theyre not being patronizing nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesnt mean much to them at all its worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the 70s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one its worth noting because thats symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly lifeordeath but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like theyre playing the catskills except maybe gilscott heron  his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a highschooler impressed with how controversial hes beingbr br only bruce springsteens performance raises a pulse ive never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely smokes no question part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general blandness and air of selfsatisfaction here its no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rocknrollbr br but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting i dont expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by splitsecond cutaways to a backup singers tonsils now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the filmmakers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage  but all you have to do is watch rust never sleeps or the last waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians br br so really theres only two things to watch this movie for springsteens stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counterculture in decline
