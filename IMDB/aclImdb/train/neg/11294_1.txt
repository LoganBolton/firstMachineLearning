ok i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film lets name the problemsfirst this film has much of the same crew that the first two had it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion why is it that they cant get shetans dams name correct or her color in the black stallion returns we learn the sagr was the blacks chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny wtf and its set in africa in 1946 and 1947i could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940s as well when the ship wrecks time line doesnt sound quite right to me also as a goof there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetans fatherupon further notice it appears to be a gelding ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way might be a cute family film to some but its my biggest movie disappointment of the year
