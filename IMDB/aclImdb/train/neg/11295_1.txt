i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that dont particularly hold my interest but i can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their childrens activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in childrens movies disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their namebr br technically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds overdubbed and unnatural personally i hate that but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project the acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices thankfully it was a very short moviebr br now before i come off like a videogeek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst childrens movie is a positive message far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given br br if you are lost dont worry you will inevitably find your way homebr br approach wild animals without any fearbr br you can win any competition just because you know you canbr br and my favorite the final message left in the film br br its okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right
