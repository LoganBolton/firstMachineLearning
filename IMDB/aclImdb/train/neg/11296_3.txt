this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the pavlov dog experiment amongst horror movies you remember this famous conditioned reflex experiment from your school books right the russian scientist pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animals reflexes pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and lowbudgeted aussie slasher flick i hear you think well the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in nightmares is an exact variant on pavlovs experiment each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because heshe insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims so this means that after a short while inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass that way they still dont miss anything special br br regarding the quality of nightmares as a film i can be very brief this is a cheap uninspired and largely imbecilic aussie cashin on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies in the early 60s a fouryearold witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident twenty years later the same girl  helen selleck  is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares she auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part shortly after the big premiere everyone whos even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killers identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already i dont think ive ever seen a more obvious whodunit than nightmares and the creators should have just showed hisher face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment the murders are explicit and very bloody and theres also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy however the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible
