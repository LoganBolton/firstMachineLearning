the mummys tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummys hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the pastbr br while i absolutely loved the mummy with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep and quite liked the mummys hand with tom tyler as kharis which is the direct prequel to this film i was not as taken with the mummys tombbr br it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting lon chaney jr is okay as kharis but doesnt really stand out and i guess thats my main criticism of this moviethat nothing really stands out theres nothing really terrible here but nothing really outstanding either so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummys tale
