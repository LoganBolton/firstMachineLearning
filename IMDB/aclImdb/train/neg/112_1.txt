this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing pratt falls 75 of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didnt think id ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film there are at least 3 others that suck more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasnt dead inside even bogdanovichs kids are awful the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible theres a reason bogdanovich couldnt get another project until 4 years later please dont watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it youre better off finding another soulmate id rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity
