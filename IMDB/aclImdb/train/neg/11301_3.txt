nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction this is the case with the mummys tombbr br the script is leftover ideas from older better universal horror flicks like dracula and frankenstein the direction is trite and stale the acting is mediocre even chaneys kharis is feeble compared to tom tylers in the mummys hand and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy cabannes vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own filmbr br universal realized how bad this movie was and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as the mummys ghost with a much better script and better director the result was likely the best film in their four film mummy cycle although not anywhere near as good as karl freunds 1932 originalbr br cabannes footage raises this film to a 3 the new stuff is a 2 at best dick foran and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldnt have to appear in dreck like this anymore
