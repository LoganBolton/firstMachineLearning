br br get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick speakmans considerable kempo skill nice spin kicks decent with the sticks  poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting the plot isnt half bad just executed pretty poorly but if youre seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts youre missing the boat entirely and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown way way too few korean actors even extras
