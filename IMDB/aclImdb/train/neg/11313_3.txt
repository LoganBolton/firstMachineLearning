and it doesnt help rohmers case that a few years later syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject with a little help from wagnerbr br maybe this movie didnt look so paltry when it came out without the syberberg film to compare it to which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources i actually cant recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film all i know is the german version is pure magic while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposesbr br the music la musique isnt even credited here on imdb but someone based it on airs from the 12th14th centuries or something well it isnt a great help to the film it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy comme le frommage mon cherbr br rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive too and that doesnt help matters syberbergs parsifal was adorable and can be seen on german television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented  br br i shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like i remember that the last time i saw the film in a theater the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty but even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer im afraidbr br points for earnestness for chutzpah but this film simply needed beaucoup more bucks it doesnt look like a medieval manuscript it looks cheapo bon marche oh and yeah it just ends very arbitrarily with parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected blah
