this movie is probably the worst i have seen bad acting bad script bad everything comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting both cyborg van damme 1989 and nemesis olivier gruner 1993 are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still its albert pyun who has directed these two as wellbr br the story is not original the world has become a terrible place possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances a special breed of robots cyborgs live on human blood and theres the story the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them one girl together with a robot kris kristofferson built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankindbr br in this movie the director tries some hongkong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far the movie fails miserably in this attemptbr br i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to and to fans of the genre i recommend cyborg since i think its a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor and if you cant stand van damme then check out nemesisbr br i rated this movie 110
