knights was just a beginning of a series a pilot one might say the plot i really shouldnt call it that there wasnt any plot wasnt logical at all and there were many mistakes like warning im summarizing the plotbr br in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs the bad guys but after the climax nea found out that there were many many more left of them and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill but after a months training nea could kill them with a single blowbr br the movie was just pure kicking i wasnt surprised at all when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxerbr br there was one positive thing in the whole movie it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends i recommend watching it if you are in need of laughter
