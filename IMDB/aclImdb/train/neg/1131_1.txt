a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleaklytalented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actors plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of esthers struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechins instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esthers pain we never feel a victory in phoenixs talent
