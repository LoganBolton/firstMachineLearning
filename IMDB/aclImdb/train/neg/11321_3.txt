you cant really go far when the initial story isnt all that great the premise of cyborgs needing blood is just dopeybr br the script is blas√© the actors dont have much to work with the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs its a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no budgetbr br lack of budget is okay if theres a story solarbabies and blood of champions are examples of decent work from no  but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich again forgivable if only the story didnt just plain suckbr br finally this movie commits the biggest crime of all it doesnt finish it simply ends as if its a commercial break away from the rest of the movie but the rest never comes just oddbr br just bad
