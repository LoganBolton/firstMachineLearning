there is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel it was drivel when it was a vhs rental and its drivel on satellite reruns nowbr br it might fool you because it has 2 moderately wellknown names in kistofferson and henriksen reasonable soundtrack music and nice monument valley scenerybr br it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lotbr br if thats all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you happybr br its still drivel though
