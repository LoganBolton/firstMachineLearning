i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so i didnt know who had done it at first the longer i saw it the more i started thinking jesus this looks like an albert pyun flick wasnt quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the utah desert scenery was beautiful and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor paulin must have adlibbed the many clever oneliners he shot out because albert pyun hasnt written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career unfortunately paulin doesnt have all that much screen time before hes gone and the movies the worse for it lance henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as hes done in countless other movies like this i dont know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it he goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent kathy long the nominal hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesnt have an iota of acting talent but that doesnt matter in a movie like this this being an albert pyun film its full of the trademarks that weve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured ah nobodyll ever noticebr br as bad as this movie is however its a shade above most of pyuns other effortsthis is citizen kane compared to his brainnumbing adrenaline feel the rush for example the fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying alright already go to something else and long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great derri√®re its not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but its not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyuns usual extravaganzas you could do worse than rent this movienot much worse granted but worse nonetheless
