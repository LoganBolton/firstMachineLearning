this is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that albert pyun made in 1993  and its the bad one apparently all his energy went into nemesis which was an entertaining nonstop action movie and had a much more expensive look knights is clunky and cheesy a bottomofthebarrel scifi that too often resembles a video game new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long not a particularly attractive woman but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine as for kris kristofferson considering his age at the time 58 i hope his stunt double was well paid 12
