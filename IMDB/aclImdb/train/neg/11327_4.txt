set in a postapocalyptic environment cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population they basically keep them as livestock as they need fresh human blood to live off nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid and years have past when she came facetoface with the cyborgs again but this time shes saved by the cyborg gabriel who was created to destroy all cyborgs job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city while nea with revenge on mind pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and shell get him to gabrielbr br cheap lowrent cyborg  postapocalyptic foray by writer  director albert pyun who made cyborg prior to it and the blistering nemsis the same year is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story as the turgid script is weak corny and overstated the leaden banter tries to be witty but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine the material couldve used another polish up as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone the openended cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt especially since a sequel has yet to be made makes it feel like that that run out of money and said time to pack up lets finish it off another day or maybe in another decade theres no rush however it did find it rather diverting thanks largely to its quick pace some wellexecuted combat and george mooradians gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop performances are fair kris kristoffersons dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a selfassured psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression however her acting is too wooden a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouthwatering performance of pure ham as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slowmotion seeping into the background is a scorching but mechanical sounding music score the special effects and makeup fx stand up fine enough watchable but not quite a success and its minimal limitations can be a cause of that
