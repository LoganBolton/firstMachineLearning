every once in a while i will rent an actionadventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important this is why i own a copy of charlies angels 2000  not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reasonbr br in any case i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged for the most part i got what i wanted the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode and the kathy longs acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys  unfortunately most of them die pretty darned quickbr br like most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasnt strong to begin with deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting however the more kathy long fights the more time the director devotes to her backside by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy longs tight red shorts were center screenbr br unfortunately there just wasnt enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours  by all means go to the grocery store and spend the 50 cents on the rental there are some strong similarities between the show and this moviebr br just dont expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hoursbr br unless of course you happen to like kathy longs derri√®re then you might want to purchase a copy
