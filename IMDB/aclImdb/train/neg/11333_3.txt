this movie is just crap even though the directors claim to be part of that oiculture its still a very very bad directorial debut the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing theres no timing at all in that movie i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie its their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell i met ben one of the directors on several occasions and hes a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesnt make him a director i think that american history x is full of clichés but somehow manages to transport a story oiwarning is full of clichés doesnt tell anything new or provocative and thats the sad thing about this movie its far from any oirealitybr br if you wanna see weird but great german films watch the movies of michael haneke christoph schlingensief oskar roehler hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegelbr br bennys video funny games die unberührbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmäuschenstill br br  out of ten because of the topic and the photography
