heres yet another blasphemous european story in which they blast the religion of their country these atheist filmmakers are relentless here we see a brutal blasting of catholics andor the catholic clergy and i am not catholicbr br this won actually won an academy award for bes foreign film thats probably because the story made catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else hes portrayed as nothing but an idiot no wonder the secular dominated academy loved this moviebr br also there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story the daughters take turns seducing the seminary student who states he studied for six years but says hes an agnostic i mean how blasphemous is this filmbr br this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secularprogressive bigotry of the film business worldwide not just hollywood
