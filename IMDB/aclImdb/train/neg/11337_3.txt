i am normally a spike lee fan it takes some time to really get into his mojo but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart lee is a genius unlike the 25th hour or bamboozled two of my favorite films of his there was no clear story in this film i was able to understand the struggle between washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others but for some odd reason lee was never able to get the true feeling out washington did a decent job with what was handed to him but you could tell that this was not lees favorite film not only did lee direct this film but he also wrote it you could tell the camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film this film was coming full circle and it wasnt going to be pretty lee was not 100 behind this film as he was with do the right thing of all the films i have seen lee direct this was the brightest and more modest of his films it was almost as if he created a hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own i dont know if he saw the money from do the right thing and ran with it or what Â… but this film did not demonstrate his true talentbr br for anyone out there that has seen this film and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by spike lee afterwards due to this film i suggest you give him a second chance dont get me wrong i see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you but lee does grow up his work becomes more of his own and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films it took me awhile to watch the 25th hour but when i did it was sheer brilliance perhaps it was the actors perhaps the story but lee crafted an amazing film out of one mans journey into the unknown i guess that is what i was hoping mo better blues would turn out to be this really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up but instead all i got was denzel being denzel he really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation and i do consider him the sydney poitier of cinema but this was not the film to showcase his talentbr br another issue that i had with this film was the use of spikes sister playing one of the love interests i dont know about you and your family but i do not think that i could have filmed a sex scene with my sister i dont care who the actor is or how much money i am getting paid i would never do it it is just something that i never wish to see but apparently that is different for spike he went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse it was sad and it even made me blush also i need somebody to answer me this what was flavor flav doing introducing this film so i am sitting there on my couch ready to start the film when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film then he acknowledges himself that did not build for a strong remaining of the story again i felt that lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent perhaps that is how he could afford both denzel and wesley in the same movie without any explosionsbr br there were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end dont get me wrong this was a very bad movie but there is always a diamond in every alleyway the scene when bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing he continually went back and forth weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that lee was actually behind the camera it was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes the other scene that was worth watching was the way that lee introduced and ended the film by keeping the same pacing and direction he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life other than these two moments the rest of the film was pure rubbish not worth viewing unless you are about to go blindbr br grade  out of
