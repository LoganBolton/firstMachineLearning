i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiestworst attempts at one a lot of the scenes work in a plugandplay manner inserted strictly to conform to the romanticcomedy genre usually this is okay because were dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive this movie fails to do sobr br there is no sense of who the characters really are apart from sylvie moreaus who is the real star of this movie not isabelle blais they fit into this onedimensional clich√© and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrativebr br the pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary closeups i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious of course along with that you have the rightoncue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatchedbr br i cant believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive if you expect a good lighthearted romantic comedy this is not it or rather this a poor attempt at it you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicksbr br les aimants is a good movie for what it is but its a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteurs
