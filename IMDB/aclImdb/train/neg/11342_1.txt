i should explain why i gave thispiece of art 1 star rating out of possible 10 simply because its hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased probably it would have been the same if i had given it 1010  explanations anyway would have followedbr br i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so  i think thats disgusting and pretty terrible in all the possible contextual meanings but as i found out after watching this movie  there is a genre called historical drama  and probably it would have been the case of 1010 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it and made kill bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible but the thing about historical drama genre is that its a subcategory of the trash movies where john romero is the undeadgoryemperoroftheguts and so automatically it cant be rated as your default movie  as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you cant really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so or it was simply bad its for the people who like to enjoy bad acting bad screenplay and bad everything else and by some turn of faith  i am one of them too there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go  the day is saved but thats definitely an opinion of mine and doesnt have match with anyones elsebr br what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie  then fellinis casanova is definitely the choice but heed my advice and dont rate it by default means
