1st watched 222003  4 out of 10dirjim kammerud  brian smith drab and unspectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated 101 dalmatians yes the movie continues where it ended in the first one but the problem is that it plays out much like the original one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story which this one doesnt have the animation is also very unspectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and redos etc etc probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out
