i mean the word pedestrian seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen faith domergue can do better than this she is supposed to be the mysterious vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson theres an idea eh instead shes a common wouldbe housewife of the fifties and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee as for the rest of the cast they are all so earnestly allamerican that the result is laughable this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in the cat people i think cult of the cobra should really be titled cult of the contractual obligation why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slowmoving predictable derivative failure like this
