cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie unfortunately that is not saying muchbr br it has a competent cast of secondrankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances it is efficiently directed entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot it looks ok but is ponderously overplotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily paddedbr br for example the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too manybr br the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia nor is shebr br julias feminine intuition is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development but it doesnt similarly petes investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen timebr br these are just symptoms of the underlying problem the movie is structured like a mystery but it isnt as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already knowbr br the ending is particularly lame julia is menaced purely by accident lisa has no reason to want to kill her  she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have donebr br it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads then it occurred to me someone said those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko so why dont we make one like thatbr br cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people mysterious troubled shapeshifting woman falls in love with the hero is apparently frigid kills people arouses the suspicions of the heros woman friend and dies at the end but modelled on doesnt mean as good as  by a wide margin it copies but doesnt understand what it is copyingbr br it is obviously trying for the lowkey suggestive lewton style but this approach doesnt follow through into the story lisa is no irene she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york there is never any doubt about her purpose neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snakebr br then again during her nocturnal prowling we get not one but two attempts at buses neither come off because the director doesnt understand what makes a bus work and in any case they happen to the stalker not the person being stalkedbr br these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitationbr br plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little timepasser came out
