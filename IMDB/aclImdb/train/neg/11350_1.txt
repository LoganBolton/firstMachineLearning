as long as theres been 3d technology 1950s i think theres been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i dont remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960s if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in 3d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses this claim was a bad move because its not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie
