with the massive advertising this is getting on nickelodeon and nick jr and that ilk my son was bugging us to see it between dvd and the theaters ive seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding incredibles shrek to the really bad walle brother bear but this was easily the worst movie ive ever seen kids or no kids it was a when it this stupid thing going to end kind of experience ok its aimed at toddlers or it better be  its insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 but ive never seen something so predictable repetitive and slowmoving then once youre finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke but there isnt one  its serious though its hard to tell what theyre trying to accomplish the 3d effects yeah if youve never seen a viewmaster theyre a big deal otherwise no if you look at the screen without glasses it appears to be the same process even my son was bored by the end both my wife and i looked at each other and said wow at the end bad in every respect
