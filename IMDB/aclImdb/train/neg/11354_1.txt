i also having endured hundreds of childrens movies in the past consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seenbr br 1 i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not the bad guys also that mocking russian names like poopchev is inappropriatebr br 2 the grandfather flys birthday party scene contained a quasisexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone two other flies also needlessly use the word crap twicebr br 3 the whole movie largely smacks of 1950s stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we as a nation were proud to have risen abovebr br in all its just crude badly animated even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
