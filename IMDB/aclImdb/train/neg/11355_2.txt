nat voiced by trevor gagnon along with his brainiac friend iq voiced by philip bolden and the always hungry scooter david gore are kids with big dreams they want to be the first flies in space and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the apollo 11 is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang outbr br the first thing you notice is the animation of the film i found it done very well done the scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes i didnt see the movie in 3d as it was broadcast on hbo however i could see that there really wasnt any scenes which took advantage of the 3d effects except a fight between characters near the end i also wasnt really impressed with the design of the characters to me they didnt look like anything resembling a fly especially in the coloring the flies were an unusual bluegray that was kind of distracting to mebr br the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasnt good either there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story the writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh i saw nothing for adults like jokes that theyll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaningbr br history was not followed in this film in fact i think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on apollo 11 i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration thoughbr br if you are an adult this is not for you it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids but save this one for a rainy day
