i havent read a biography of lincoln so maybe this was an accurate portrayalbr br and maybe its because im used to the equally alienating and unrealistic worshiping portrayals that unnaturally deify lincoln as brilliant honorable and the savior of our countrybr br but why would they make a movie representing lincoln as a buffoon while henry fonda made an excellent lincoln his portrayal of him as an aw shucks im just a simple guy seemed a little insultingbr br granted that was bushie jrs whole campaign to make us think he was just a regular guy so we wouldnt care that hes a rich  privileged moron  but thats a whole other storybr br not only did the film show lincoln as sort of a simple almost simpleminded kind of guy  the film states that lincoln just sort of got into law by accident and that he wasnt even that interested in the law  only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law being about rights  wrongs in the film hes not a very good defense attorney he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses and the outcome is mostly determined by chanceluckbr br furthermore partly because this was financed by republicans in reaction to some play sponsored by democrats that had come out and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times the film is unfortunately religious racist and conservativebr br dont waste your time on this film
