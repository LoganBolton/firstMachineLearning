okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon so they did someone somewhere was an idiotbr br i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware as far as i can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on the graphics in general were pretty good  the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my popular mechanics flyingcar gearhead blood still runs strong and the 3d was pretty effective the cg wasnt pixarquality but it was generally good the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some halfassed late60s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies africanamerican flies with giant afros and black shades etc and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made suitably gross squelching noisesbr br the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clich√©s 60s gender politics including mostlyuseless female characters racial stereotypes evil russians a fat fly who only wants to eat gradetwo level grossout humour in a movie aimed for imax they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel  they didnt get their physics right zerog in the lunar module during landing burn please they couldnt even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crapbr br but we liked the maggotsbr br so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots uh yay 155
