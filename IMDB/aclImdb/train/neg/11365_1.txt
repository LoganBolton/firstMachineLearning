this is a very sad movie really nothing happens in this movie the script is bad i guess theyve just copypaste the first 15 pages to 90 pages the producers must have thought lets create a hollywood movie here in belgium they didnt succeed now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at 22h45 or something in the past we have had really good movies in belgium like daens shades is a waste of your time maybe you could sneak in the theater after youve seen a real movie if youve seen 10 minutes of shades youve seen it all it was advertised to death on local radio and tv i hope it will disappear in the shades soon
