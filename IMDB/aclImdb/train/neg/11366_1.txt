the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it hadnt even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there dont even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and hes stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor whos star has long stopped rising hes helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shadesbr br as soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a nonenglish speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressivebr br we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for the 10
