this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one and im jewishbr br anbody go to journalism school read an editorial freshman year rhetoric these alarmist assertions presented in a palatable way might prove persuasive but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments nor viable or any at all solutions few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an ineffectual diatribebr br and thank goodness for that  i wouldnt want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrapbr br a good lesson for me  and hopefully a cautionary tale for you  to actually read about a film before seeing it
