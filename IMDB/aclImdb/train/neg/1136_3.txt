every movie from the thirties is dated but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others ie grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama with ford theres always the hardsell of someones nobility abe the joads always the overemphasis of some heavys badness always the poorly crafted awkward and obvious scripts this is no exception its just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment and sentiment is all this has going for itbr br what ford does here doesnt make me appreciative of lincoln it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here ford went on to make decent movies this is too dated to be anything but bad it feels entirely false br br henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing s or say shonuff
