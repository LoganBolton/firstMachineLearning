this video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam its a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it perhaps as an american citizen every person must protest against this kind of crap if you want to know the truth about islam dont let nobody tell you the quran is public you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say its true or falsebr br the video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see even if they dont really understand whats going on in there they use images that are misplaced from their original contentbr br to end the comment i would like to make a reflexion dont you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world
