i couldnt relate to this film it failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or aesthetically the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving i couldnt connect with and hence care about any of the characters and im finding it hard to find much thats positive to say about itbr br ive read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology ill admit that as an atheist i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and dont rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs
