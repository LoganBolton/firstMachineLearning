you talking to me 1987 is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big when he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image he goes from good fella to a surfs up dude over night his friend cant believe the change but he scores with faith ford and gets a cool paying gig can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it bigbr br this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this timebr br dont waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gumpbr br xx
