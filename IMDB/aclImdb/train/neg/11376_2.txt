despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy the inconsistencies of its main character bronson green aspiring new york actor easily turned la phony makes it hard to take the story seriously green who is constantly rejected by los angeles casting agents for being obsolete ie too new york when the 80s is looking for big blonde and dumb he finds success comes easily when hes willing to succumb to falsifying his image unfortunately the new hair dye and pacified surfer attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the jericho church which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the aryan nation green is willing to easily forget his past and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years in order to be the churchs new spokesman this makes no sense seeing as how principled our character initially is it is this sudden and loose change in character coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened deniroobsessed as his taxi driver character form who is able to battle the villains a noble attempt on the filmmakers but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but seriousbr br the other characters too are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily  the psychotic paranoia of the church leader the selfinterested actress girlfriend the first girlfriend bronson has when hes in la and the new blonde girlfriend whos character lacks so much development she is for the most part just a walking talking void we are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters but there is really little development of any of thembr br the other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters obviously and later we see bronsons difficulties with breaking into the la acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection but after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happensbr br for films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism this was not one done with enough credibility
