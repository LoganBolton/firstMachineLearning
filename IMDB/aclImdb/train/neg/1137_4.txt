i tried twice to get through this film succeeding the first time  and it was like pulling teeth  and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer the problem its simply too boringbr br if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene which takes up most of the second half of the film you have it made but its tough getting to that point there are some interesting talks by abraham lincoln henry fonda during the trial the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screenbr br its a nice story wellacted and suchbut it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film
