when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is goodbad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hypersmart boy beaten by his older brother parents who dont understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a supermodern robot who works on two aasize batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and superactivated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society
