anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressionsbr br 1 the angry eyes look he gives every enemy 2 the holding of the hands to face mouth agape and frightened eyes 3 the smiling tommy turnbullbr br i have to say that i pretty much hate this show i dont watch it but its like code lyoko weve all watched at least one i must say that this show is borderline racist uninteresting and pointlessbr br every episode ends with robotboy winning except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpackbr br the jokes are pretty crude too i think its mostly people saying the word suck or farting i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking toobr br isnt there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate and the other uses a chain for god sake what kind of school is he going to not to mention his older brother who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualitiesbr br the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters like you could say the trio of coop jamie and kiva as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and hes free spirited despite being a robotbr br there is simply no appeal to this show im surprised that its still running
