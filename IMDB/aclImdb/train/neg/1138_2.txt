this was a complete disappointment the acting isnt bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is ok if you are ok with cheesy moral plots and dont mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it
