when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring its not that i dont get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact its just that in this film they are very boring if you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships youd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you it is realistic but you wouldnt go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie
