for years i remember reading about this show trouble with tracy in the tv guide cftotv toronto every saturday morning at 6 am i lived about a twohour drive north of toronto and we couldnt get cfto but you know how it is  we always want what we cant havebr br well i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this trouble with tracy was all about did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role was there nudity was there suspense was it a comedy it wouldve been fine if there was some promotion of the show at least i couldve known what i was missing but no the mystery drove me bonkers until ctv affiliate ckco built a retransmitter in wiarton ontario and began to broadcast trouble with tracy at the same time as cftosaturday mornings at 6 am one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at 559 and at last i got to see what the trouble with tracy was yes the trouble with tracy was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it wasbr br talented canadian actor steve weston died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed part of me died too
