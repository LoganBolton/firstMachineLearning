wow i cant believe people consider this a good movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romanticfunny comedies with john cusackbr br this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasnt terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that dont show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they dont know themselves well enough to realize that they dont love the people they are engaged to how do we know they arent in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two showbr br the movie doesnt even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who cant commit to anything unlike cusacks previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etcbr br the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actionsbr br it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with everyone is too cynical criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saintbr br if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything grosse pointe blank high fidelity keeping the faith charade rear window north by northwest or theres something about mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs todays society
