not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work a young manjohn cusack and a drop dead gorgeous womankate beckinsalekeep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other although both are promised to othersoddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere a little sappy in some places but viva la love being a romantic i am almost obligated to be riveted my favorite scene is where cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling the finale is almost too sweet but most deserving this is not one of cusacks deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by beckinsale notable support is provided by jeremy piven and molly shannon john corbett plays the worst role ive ever seen him in on the other hand eugene levy is quirky and funny watch this with your soul mate
