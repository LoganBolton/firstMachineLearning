the master of cheap erotic horror rolfe kanefsky finally makes a movie that doesnt go straight to the playboy channel the hazing borrows heavily from everything that came before it from nightmare on elm street to evil dead but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable just barely the characters are cardboard the dialogue is wooden the story is paperthin and the actors couldnt act their way out of a grocery bag put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie sometimes when im bored i like to eat paper watching this movie is a lot like that chew on it for 90 minutes and youre left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value
