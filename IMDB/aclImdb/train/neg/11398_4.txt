i saw this movie primarily to see brooke burke as jill who i had meet briefly in la at a modeling trade show in her first feature film i was hoping to see more of her but thought she did very well acting her role since she is such a beautiful and poised tv host and model it was not surprising i was left wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result maybe i just missed itbr br i wasnt really sure about the genre of this movie and although i liked the actors i felt like it was for a college audience i tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasnt my favorite genre but felt like i had outgrown the gags it seemed to drag out in some places leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had and like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying endingbr br having written a couple of scripts i know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions how many movies you have seen  studied and those you relate with at a point in timebr br in a nutshell i found it interesting but not a satisfying plot and ending for me if jill brooke burke would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyones ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating
