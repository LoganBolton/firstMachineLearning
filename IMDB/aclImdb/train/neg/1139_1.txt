please note that i havent seen the film since i discovered it in 2007 and my town is smaller and doesnt carry it however i really want to say something about it im actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywoods ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film i think its laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr bucke and walt whitman please dont waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry
