today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of 60 was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin  marsha porter video  dvd guide 2003 and  wow  four stars so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but i have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of a centerfold the dorothy stratten story the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fiftytwo years old audrey hepburn and the song amigo from roberto carlos although i do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60s and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly dorothy stratten my vote is fourbr br title brazil muito riso e muita alegria many laughs and lots of happiness
