exactly what you would expect from a bmovie deritive gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy specialeffects of course it could have been better better acted defintly better written directed etc but then i guess it wouldnt have been a b movie the actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nuditybr br tiffany shepis must be singled out she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors shes also smokin hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie  wow her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekkedbr br so if your a looser bmovie horror buff like myself check this out if not you should probably avoid at all costs
