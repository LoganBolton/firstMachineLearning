i love horror films low budget 50s 60s 70s 80s but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film lets compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the changeling the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better though still far from great demon seed ok ill be fair lets compare it to madefortv horror films dont go to sleep waaay creepier and better done salems lot the night stalker night gallery even dont go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better spoilers first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers terrible also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and its a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or entity its a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suziemargaret our protagonist now that im on the topic of suzie another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse pours her heart out falls in the boiling pool struggling in agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn hers life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but thats where the positives end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either havent watched it since it originally aired or remembered it scaring them as children this film was pretty much merit less
