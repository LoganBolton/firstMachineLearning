i had to watch this in school and to sum it upbr br talentless actors talentless script and a talentless directorbr br this movie is such a waste of your time dont even watch the movie dont bother you will be so disappointed my teacher said it was supposed to be good how wrong she was she even slept through it a little the movies actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and thats not saying much its has horrible plot with awful characters so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point the script was unemotional and confusing there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said what also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes it was just absolutely horrendous
