this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen there is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful to top it all off the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible bridget fondas acting is decent but everyone elses acting is totally amateur i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cutscenes bad transitions and acting that should have been reshot read the book and dont waste your time with this film
