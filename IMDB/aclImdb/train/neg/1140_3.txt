scary but mostly in the sense that will it be over before i turn 70 i saw this as a late night rerun in about 1976 and thought it would never end like crackers its better than nothing but justbr br ray milland is a little scary because he looks as if hes been stuffed by a taxidermist yvette mimeux looks as if shes smoked up all the beautiful downtown burbank brown br br its a sort of roy rogers version of rosemarys baby this is one turkey that should never have been made if you have insomnia and its 130 on saturday morning and theres nothing on but replays of the 1972 roller derby chamionship then i guess it beats that but god help you if this is your only choice for entertainment
