this film is so bad you cant imagine the acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas an it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in switzerland the interactions between the soldiers didnt make any sense at all the story could have been taken out from a bravo photostory the dialogues were as wooden as treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy but nowadays it doesnt need much to satisfy the audience the actors were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung woah and there certainly was much abuse of drugs thats real cool man particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens but the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you dont go along with the other sheep and sayyes that is exactly what it was like when i was in the army thats exactly what im going to do when i must go to the army to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness and dont think i like the army i was there and i hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush which i was forced to do because i offended an lieutenant it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and i think its not a bad thing but this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots but since i now that my opinion isnt very popular i will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your witsbr br 210br br sorry for my bad english
