seriously  avoid this movie at any cost i just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although i paid nonrefundable money for it i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave first time ever i walked out of a movie and i lived through some pretty bad onesbr br its one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language it relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book on the military what do we do once we reach the fighting zone  you get out of the car and die actually its much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high  all badly written and acted on women in the army why do we only get trumpets we were promised guns  thats the way it is thats the way itll stay argh okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare mebr br additionally i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv so it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited Â– it just didnt work at least not on any level used as a measure for filmsbr br i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee germans and thats saying something if you like stereotypes which i dont its nice to play with them though just in case somebody thinks im not being pc enoughbr br instead of going to see this film do something useful try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand einsteins theories convert to a different religion and back  in fact go and listen to last christmas by wham on endless repeat anything but dont watch this awful flick
