well awful is just the first name this movie is a clichéridden piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp im sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deservebr br this may contain spoilersbr br just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the hepo military police will not come to get you if you dont make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didnt work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldnt have been able to save the scene br br next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my lifebr br there are also girls in the campexcitingone ofem even a model though not looking that greatand the baddest actress ive ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie br br okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire br br there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty no the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted no one will notice the engine sounds especially not at nightbr br there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well switzerland is too small a market for any feature film well donebr br one sex scene takes place in the kitchen surely none of those facilities are ever locked the military routines are as sloppy as they can getbr br in the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him because he deserted his fiancée sure i buy that the italians are that waya jealous bunch not br br the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses not at night in a dark alley again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there there are no such things as guards or fences br br the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians car the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiancée off their feet no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens its a comedy rememberbr br okay its a comedy i got that and i can live with that no realism needed filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging unfortunately it is none of those its just embarrassing a ripoff from brainless american comedies the latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actorsbr br it is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did yawn
