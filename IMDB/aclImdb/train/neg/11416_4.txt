the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerlands film history makes me shake my head its true but pitiful at the same time a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal betterbr br the story sounds interesting at the beginning antonio carrera michael koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love laura moretti mia aegerterbr br the acting in some way doesnt really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying br br the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected the romancepart is too trashy and the comedypart is not funny at all its just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever its funny for preadolescent 1213 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy the humor is weak except for some shotsbr br dope cool stealing cool if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then dont expect too muchbr br ill give it 4 out of 10 stars because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time not a hell of a lot screen time though
