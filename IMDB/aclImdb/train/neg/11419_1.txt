i think ive seen this sort of thing before college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives suckbr br this movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bites from what i can make of it they practically have the same plotbr br if anything good came out of this snorefest it was the music that was itbr br as far as im concerned im not impressed but then again i never expected anything less this movie was directed by the same person that directed batman and robin another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in towbr br now for the verdict its a 1 out of 10
