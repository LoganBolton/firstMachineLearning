i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are selfabsorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her longsaved virginity in a throwaway onenight stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that were supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywoods concept of young america permissive detached promiscuous conceited
