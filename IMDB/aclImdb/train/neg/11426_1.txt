heather graham couldnt play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie ive seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to signup on imdb and make sure the rating of this film dropsbr br omg im heather graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while shes passed out im really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and id like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while im at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character whos mentally unstable like your socalled lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly btch get a grip br br what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but im so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if youre a smart person youll hate this movie and if youre not a smart person then youll love it its as simple as that
