i dont know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobicbr br i can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled antigay or they dont get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway its not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do its full of clich√©s and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing  much less funnybr br i hated it and im not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb werent as unbiased in their judgment
