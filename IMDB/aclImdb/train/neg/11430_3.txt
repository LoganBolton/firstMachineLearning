okay let me coin a new word here polyphobia the fear of polyamorous relationships this is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them blehbr br mark my words a few decades from now polyphobia is going to be just as big a fauxpas as homophobia but guess who was too closeminded to realize this right the first time the producers of this movie and so many like it why even make a ridiculously conservative and oldfashioned type of movie like this priding itself on being limitlessly openminded about gayness it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory open your eyes people pleasebr br this is a disappointing runofthemill chickflick but damn i gotta say heather graham is the cutest thing alivebr br 3 out of 10
