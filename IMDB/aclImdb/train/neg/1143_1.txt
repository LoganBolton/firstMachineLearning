even 20 years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy submachine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and smokepainfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of 3 asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much nonexistent  then again ninja cant act save yourselves  avoid watching at all costs
