otherwise it is one of the worst movies ive ever seen  and i mean ever my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable women nonlesbian dont bathe together  nor do they accidentally kiss brothers and sisters dont live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park men dont find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife absolutely ridiculousbr br heather graham is possibly the worst actress in films today she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights  and that is because she wasnt actingbr br i cannot stress enough how bad this movie was
