after a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside youre pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy then the movie takes a turn for the worse br br the warm feeling might still be there but as others has said the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that its almost unbearable to watch br br the movie gets sped up and you get the impression that youre either fast forwarding through it or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes outbr br realism isnt a goal onto itself but as a viewer im pretty convinced that this comedy isnt intentionally unrealistic it just happens to bebr br on the plus side this movie has a couple of nice interiors and despite the bad script i think that the actors performances are mainly good if i could rate the first 25 minutes only id probably give it an eight as it is now it gets a four and thats being nice br br if youre a sucker for romantic comedies youll probably have a great time anyways if not id recommend that you watch something else
