quite possibly the worst movie ive ever seen i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners dont get me wrong i love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor stunk it seemed to me that they were going for a napoleon dynamite feel  strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience instead it ended up being forced awkward and weirdbr br the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she and sissy spacek had signed up for this horrible thingbr br thank gosh i didnt pay for it
