by no means is this movie as bad as perfect stranger but it just wasnt funny it couldnt stick to one type of comedy  it jumped from snl to adam sandleresquire to romantic to little guy scores big to slapstick to loser the movie types of comedies although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments the fall down the hill no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way schindlers list was funnier and felt shorter you never knew if andy samberg was supposed to be in high school a college dropout or just a loser living at home with his mother  sissy spacek in her worst choice of roles and poor ian mcshane the serious actor if i only had to name one is given crap to read into the camera the story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end no spoilers here in case adam sambergs mom wants to see it dont spend any money going to see this movie and maybe lorne michaels will get the hint and start producing quality yes waynes world and tommy boy are quality movies
