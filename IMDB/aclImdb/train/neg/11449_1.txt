when viewing a movie as silly as hot rod one must sit back relax and alter ones intellectual capacity to a like state  which is in this case a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy with a brief runtime of 88 minutes this film was long past drawnout and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and werent even funny in the first place hot rods base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004s cult hit napoleon dynamite though its much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter in fact the movies blatant desperation to be compared to napoleon dynamite is scornful and offensive and left me ticked off instead of just being annoyedbr br the movie if one were compelled enough to call it such poses a paltry story that puts selfproclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses one more than his idol evel knievel jumped so were told by rod and raising 50000 dollars for his stepfathers impending lifesaving heart operation all so that he can fight his stepfather once recovered and gain his respect because in order to gain ones respect one must first fight them huh whatever each character is no more interesting than rods stickon mustache and from the films opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion each scene played like a nonsensical and terribly unfunny snl skit  which with the addition of an extra 85 minutes is essentially what hot rod strives to bebr br the films star andy samberg contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last dripdrop of his comedic capabilities unfortunately  rather realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a fiveyearold retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and peepee gags and if thats disappointing pull a chair hide your face in your hands and brace yourself for the real blow he is the films humor to rescue them of their mortification ill willingly omit the ghastliness of sambergs costars roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team director akiva schaffer to his nonexistent talent as a director or a comedian basically every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crashcourse comedy is perfectly portrayed here and done so arrogantly as though the film would be funnier that way trick yourself into believing that theres even a single laugh in this heap or treat yourself to another movie  any other movie
