first off to give you some idea of my taste in moviesbr br 2007 comedies i enjoyed superbad knocked up hot fuzz blades of glory br br 2007 comedies i hated evan almighty the brothers solomon good luck chuckbr br i should have followed my first instinct and turned off hot rod after i got to about the 20 minute mark i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once the script is absolutely brutal  i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on imdb any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defectivebr br this doesnt come close to anything with will farrell and its clear that andy samberg cant carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on youtube or snl i dont know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie they must have owed favors or something i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie but i thought it would at least be funny i didnt so much as smirkbr br i dont normally comment on movies at imdb but this was so awful i just had to warn people this is only the 4th movie ive seen that ive felt compelled to rate 110
