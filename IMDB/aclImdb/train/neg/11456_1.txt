this is one of those movies which makes you think would hulk  the real american  hogan have done the same frankly i dont think so and hed have been right im italian i cannot go proud of my country for many reasons but i wouldnt have rowed for another team the french for example simply because im in love with juliette binoche besides the protagonist doesnt fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman so why rowing against yale as far as acting is concerned well all the players act very poorly and then  you know i hated that dead poets society  atmosphere in fact thats another movie i hate
