ok i know that the wannabe john hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat so the expectations for this film ran pretty lowbr br still after sitting through this crap theres one key thing i cant seem to get out of my headbr br i just sat through an 80s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in thembr br the acting is awful the characters boring and flat the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult and the rowing scenes unexciting uneventful and inaccuratebr br unless youve got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays or i guess rob lowe fetish theres really no reason to see this one
