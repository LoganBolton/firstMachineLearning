this film cant make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or dont ever go in the water again a fisherman nolan is out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow  and i use the word in all senses  who is obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece  throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself i doubt it was her first when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous selfinflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychosbr br the film reeks of halfthought out antihuman message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all its true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whales pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little betterbr br the films final journey in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of melvilles eerie manwhale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident its clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss however it never goes there the whalecharacter has no compassion or respect for anyonebr br the final scene loses this focus and becomes jawslike where the seamonster finally kills everybody and nolan and nodoubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whalehugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier i love animals and i detest whaling and what is more i love orca whales but if this films goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maimingbr br the only message one can walk away with is if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you
