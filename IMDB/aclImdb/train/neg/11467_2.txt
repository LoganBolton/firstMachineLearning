many have stated that orca  killer whale is a jaws ripoff this is not really true though the enormous commercial success of jaws undoubtedly made these man vs beast stories more attractive propositions for filmmakers in the second half of the 70s orca  killer whale would be better described as a modernday retread of moby dick its a story about obsession on one hand a whales obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate on the other a bounty hunters obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives sadly orca killer whale emerges a very disappointing film its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plottingbr br shark hunter nolan richard harris encounters a marinelife researcher rachel bedford charlotte rampling diving off the atlantic coast of canada their meeting almost ends in disaster when rachels team are attacked by a great white shark but a killer whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark after this nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a killer whale and selling it to an aquarium but his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on rachel tells nolan that a killer whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human worse still native umilak will sampson warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it eventually nolan is forced to pursue the killer whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the arctic ocean where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each otherbr br two things stand out in this film one is the haunting score by ennio morricone perhaps the greatest composer of film music of alltime his talents wasted on various tenthrate clunkers during the 70s and 80s the other is the amazing widescreen photography of ted moore which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye in every other department orca  killer whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew harris appears extremely ill throughout the film his hair bedraggled black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale his performance lacks the usual vitality rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her longwinded and illinformed explanations about the ways of whales the rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles the most memorable of which sees bo derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale the plot is total nonsense from start to finish with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery although its credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd orca  killer whale is really one for completists of the man vs beast cycle from the late 70s most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair
