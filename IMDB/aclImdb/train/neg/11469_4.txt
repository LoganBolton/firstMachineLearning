orca is not exactly bad but its not really richard harriss finest hour either as a demented ahablike fisherman harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whales wife and unborn child charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone he doesnt listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whales eye  there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is bo derek as one of harriss crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast including robert carridine will sampson and keenan wynn dont fare very well either
