orca starts as crusty irish sea captain nolan richard harris  his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called ken robert carradine comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale this raises nolans interest in killer whales  decides he wants to catch one of them instead however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female  injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess  enrages her mate nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least  kills one of nolans crew before they reach the dry land of newfoundland in canada once there the killer whale conducts a series of attacks on the town  its people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the deathbr br directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant ripoff was terrible im sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous  utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes the script by producer luciano vincenzoni  sergio donati is so stupid im lost for words the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesnt help  if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whales are just one more time ill scream im sorry but i simply dont believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to  sink it i dont believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there i dont believe a killer whale can identify someones house know someone is in there  then wreck it on purpose i dont believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat i dont believe killer whales can physically recognise people  i dont believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out maybe im being a bit harsh i mean its only a film after all but its a film which is trying to be serious  things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan  hand or should that be fin deliver it the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold seriously thats a statement thats no more far fetched than anything else in this film i found the film very boring totally dull  had awful characters with no on screen presence at all it goes without saying this is a jaws 1975 ripoff which doesnt even come close to spielbergs classicbr br director anderson is no spielberg thats for sure this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense scares tension or atmosphere at all all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater  totally forgettable theres no build up to them  virtually no pay off either as orca doesnt get to eat a single person then theres the scenes which literally had me laughing the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy  the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a loving  caring couple but i couldnt help but think that this is the closest well ever get to killer whale porn hilarious stuff the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland  boring instead of footage which matches  enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else do you get the impression that i dont like this film good forget about any gore or decent deaths either theres a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and youll miss itbr br this probably had quite a big budget  it still sucks theres nothing outstanding about orca its well made i suppose but flat bland  totally forgettable the cinematography is quite nice though the acting is bad rampling is awful  the late harris irish accent is embarrassingbr br orca is a lame jaws ripoff which completely ignores or messes up everything that made spielbergs film so good this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws the revenge 1987
