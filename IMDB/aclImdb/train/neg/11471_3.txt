is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws orca isnt exactly a jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jawss success first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at bestbr br the plot is basically a male killer whale orca after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge i couldnt stand to watch this movie again the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentlessbr br as for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters arent the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty goodbr br the violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer whales dont mate with only one mate as depicted in orcabr br overall this movie was badpoor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so im not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like itbr br my rating 3510 but for its concept possibly a 510
