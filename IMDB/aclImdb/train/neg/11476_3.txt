i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently in my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sourbr br the story a us soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the us has sent out to troops for christmas he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while we learn that he doesnt have a family back home the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company the family comes to love him and viceversa the soldier also becomes in love with the familys daughter  the woman that sent the christmas card theres only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that shes in love with its also a long distance relationship the boyfriend is very different from the soldier he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors the woman prefers the latter throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the womans boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants whats best for her daughter spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common they happen to spend a lot of time together she gradually becomes attracted to his persona then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back now shes so confused shes in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but shes become so fond of the soldier soon enough the boyfriend who doesnt know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts his plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family he wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along this doesnt sound too thrilling for the woman however the soldier feels bad about what hes done and doesnt want to make things worse so he decides to leave town despite the dads urging him to stay and be with his daughter it all comes to a head when at the christmas eve service with church we find out that the soldier hasnt left yet the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he brokenhearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting togetherbr br things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film hes basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a longlasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong br br things i dont like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically applauds this behavior  the family goes with church and participates in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language br br conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough so the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself therefore i dont recommend this film to anyone
