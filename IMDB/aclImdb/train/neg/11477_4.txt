sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors but this one is badbr br brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire moviebr br alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside she was stiff throughout the moviebr br i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work i would have guessed that they were firstyear studentsbr br ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line ed certainly has not lost his charisma i wish id taken the time to meet him while he was herebr br i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because ive been there i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere i was sadly disappointedbr br sorry
