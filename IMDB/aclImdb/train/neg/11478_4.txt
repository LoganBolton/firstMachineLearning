im stunned that the reviewers  imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did its an innocuous sweet uncomplicated clich√© of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels i like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and i were watching thisand before we saw the ratingwe said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because theres nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences its possible to make a good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone its miles ahead of this schlock
