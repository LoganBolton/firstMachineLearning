watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channelsbr br i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie but were extremely disappointedbr br the actor playing the soldier seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether hes chopping down christmas trees seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend or when hes happily surprised by the girl he loves hes an awful actor and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at himbr br then theres the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count dots and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dotsbr br so its basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend its as predictable as it gets and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because its all so cornybr br i love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine and they all laugh thats the hillbilly attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like id tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he lets everyone boss him aroundbr br the movie is what first blood would have been if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world
