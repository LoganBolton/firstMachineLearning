is it just me or is that kid really annoyingbr br hideos sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so as for him well i know hes a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far im only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i cant not know what its all about although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards ie dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning as yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie ill update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement
