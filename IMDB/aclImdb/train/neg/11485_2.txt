forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 so many 2s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority dont translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfullybr br theres a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers dont look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailingbr br naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with whats going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly illplacedoutofthenorm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until its explained much later its one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes coveredbr br despite it clocking in under 90 minutes  i think its a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark  it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but its a classic case of too little too latebr br what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as youll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel  it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latterbr br the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit  its still not worth the time so better to avoid this
