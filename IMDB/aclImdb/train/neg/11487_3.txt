the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps accidents and destruction mostly caused by stan but with ollie receiving the bulk  of the punishment see the great the music box 1933 or towed in a hole 1932 as some some classic examplesbr br here however for some reason is it because it was based on a sketch by stans father the boys play it straight in a comedy built around jokes and supposedly funny situations it doesnt come off its merely another thirdrate tedious 30s comedy heightened only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures ollies finger wiggling stans blank stares etc or comic abilitiesbr br the film begins with them running from the police since we never see or know why its hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in colonel buckshots mansion the premise for the humor ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging they are not playing stan and ollie in this film their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poorbr br stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny but he doesnt get the chance to do any of that here hes constrained by uttering too much dialog to move the plot but none of it rises much above the silly we are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing lord plumtrees name the call me a cab okay youre a cab joke cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns and a nonsequiter ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two and james finlayson is still doing his silentera full body takes and keystone kop jumping jacksbr br stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in sons of the desert1933 where we get to see them do what we love about them  be themselves in fact 193234 seem to be their best yearsbr br since this film does not play to any of their strengths why bother with it i have to give it a 3
