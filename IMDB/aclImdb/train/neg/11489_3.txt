in the us very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of julius caesar or shortly thereafter hollywoods sword and sandal epics mostly have a christian theme which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in itbr br its interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of caesar and christ but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated king tarquin and formed the republicbr br however this is not a historical film its peplum and while the production values arent rock bottom the acting and characterizations are cardboard i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian but with wooden english dubbing its very campy i got a few good laughs out of it at firstbr br i havent seen many films of this genre having missed most of the hercules movies of the 60s its amusing up to a point but as the film goes on it gets somewhat boringbr br one things for sure if id seen this movie when i was ten years old i would have loved it at that age i went for anything with romans and swordfights in it so at least this flick brought back some childhood memories
