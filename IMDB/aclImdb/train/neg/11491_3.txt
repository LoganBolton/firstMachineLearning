this is a fascinating filmespecially to old movie buffs and historians i am both during the first half of the twentieth century sadly black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters as a result theaters catering to black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the black experience and showing black actors in many cases the films were essentially similar plotwise to standard hollywood fare but with a much much lower budgetand usually horrid production values you really cant fault the film makersthey just didnt have the money and resources available to the average film company as a result they had to make due with a lot lessincluding an overreliance on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for reshooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene autry filmstarring herb jeffries instead jeffries was a lightskinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films in each he sings a little fights a little though very poorly and loves a littleeverything you need in a cowboy believe it or not jeffries is still alive at age 96br br the general plot was indiscernible from an autry picturecomplete with anachronistic items such as telephones out west the problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through stymie from the lil rascals flubbed a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music leaving the film strangely quiet and the acting was pretty awfulbr br now this does not mean that the film isnt worth seeingonly that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher one reviewer oddly scored this film a 10 how this can be with all the problems is beyond me however i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems the plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and its a very important piece of american history but a 10 br br by the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost whiteskinned jefferies is paired with short dumpy and exceptionally dark mantan morelandas his brother also spencer williams may be familiar to you he played andy on tvs amos n andy
