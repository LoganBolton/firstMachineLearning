how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this its amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent  even the wellknown gottfried john is acting very poor  especially in the double murder scene  how amateurish the screen plan is very  very extended  perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie be careful not to fall asleep while watching the set is obviously very often a blue screen fg the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor  probably reason different languages of actors  but other international productions do handle this much more professional advice do not watch  its a diabolic waste of time
