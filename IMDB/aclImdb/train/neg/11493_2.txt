störtebeker is truly one of the worst tv miniseries ever made on this planetbr br the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense just two examples visby was shown as a village of three houses instead it was a major city at this time its best days already passed by secondly hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea hamburg had no access to the baltic sea the major town at that time was lübeckbr br but worse than all that the directing how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this impossible there was not a single believable scene it the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern scenesbr br i cant understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent
