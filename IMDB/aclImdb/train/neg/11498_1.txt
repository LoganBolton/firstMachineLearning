gadar is an example of one of bollywood worst overrated movies ever directed by anil sharma who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie the songs were boring and aint the kind of song you want to listen to in your car full volume sunny deol is famous for making daft movies where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own he even kicks a metal jail door indian and kicks a moving car far away teesri aankh i can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by sunny deol but im sure most people know this already sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role a guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece by using violence amisha patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone but even she couldnt save the film from being a disaster instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie she doesnt maybe cos she was playing a muslim but she doesnt act like one in the movie overall this is a poor show all the way im sure it will appeal to some people who love seeing the bollywood actor beat up 100 guys give me a break
