gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake storyits too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistanthe movies aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and its government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws wont workand all the songs and music of the movie are all badmost likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguidedthe movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster
