whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmullers film is incomprehensiblebr br this new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because ive never walked out of a moviebr br but i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took linas movie and turned it into another blue lagoonbr br this is a film that you wouldnt even waste time watching late night on cinemax time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this
