i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an arthouse theatre no less but couldnt make it there in the one whole week it played but yesterday i finally saw it on cable andwelli wasnt disappointed thats for sure madonna has done it again yet another bomb when will this woman learn when will the studios learn or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little fanfare and deadly wordofmouth one would hope that being directed by her talented husband whos created some interesting andor terribly entertaining work would bring out the same quality madonna showed in desperately seeking susan alas it just isnt meant to be for here she is at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness the smugness permeating every frame shes in made all the more unbearable by her wavering fauxbritish accent an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman and look at her films of say the past decade like a latterday bette davis there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body which here despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace are done no favors to her credit the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the worlds greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess no one involved escapes unharmed bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be onscreen though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if shes actually in something good which had me thinking all the while denial aint just a river in egypt adriano giannini son of giancarlo giannini star of the italian original swept away is like his father before him immensely attractive and isnt altogether bad despite winning a razzie nomination for worst actor but like almost everything else about this production it all comes back to madonna on whose shoulders rest the blame why her why not her husband director guy ritchie just who do you think was behind this remake what actress wouldnt want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her with only a relative nobody sharing the screen oh sure ritchie deserves some blame surely he  or someone  anyone  should have and could have taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings for her performance is so wooden its a surprise the rest of the cast didnt get splinters or at least display a semblance of warmthbut she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole above and beyond anything else this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it a film like this an odd coupleish war of the classes should be light and fun with leads who can bounce off one another with witty even romantic dialogue for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded really be honestly i dont think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy i defy you to laugh even once or romance madonnas iceprincess routine precludes any chemistry its not even bad enough for us badmovie lovers to enjoy a real shame
