igor and the lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazyhippiecultkillingspree horror movie apparently even nearly twenty years later charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trashfilmmakers this is a typical troma production meaning in other words theres a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot theres a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isnt bad  but its all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at igor and the lunatics is so desperate that its even using a lot of the footage twice like the circle saw killing for example the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drugaddicted and charlie manson wannabe paul one of pauls lower ranked disciples named igor becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitchhiker girl theres an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudoartistic camera tricks like slowmotion footage and lurid dream sequences maybe theres one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete for no particular reason the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds
