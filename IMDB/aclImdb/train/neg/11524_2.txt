pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult who fights them sixteen years later the man has a child with one of the other cultists who during a raid by the police is hidden away and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town its hard to keep track of who characters are or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place the leader gets paroled sixteen years later i got that from the box  i missed the amount of time in the movie nobody is made to look any older not noticeably anywaybr br one murder is done with a large circular logging saw others are done with knives or a crossbow i never heard the title characters name mentioned in the movie but hes the one who overacts the most hooting and holleringbr br the movie is patched together pretty poorly with voiceover helping not much to explain what is going on some of the sound effects were pretty bad a man is getting punched and we hear the sound of a whip cracking a woman fires a gun and we dont hear it fire but hear a ricochet instead it doesnt seem to have been done for comical effect
