simply terrible why wouldnt you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using nonactors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these lowbudget filmsplease for the love of god use real actors most will work for freetake advantage of that now back to my commentanyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasnt funny on any level as for the qualityin one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crewguess what it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetishand it wasnt even good gore
