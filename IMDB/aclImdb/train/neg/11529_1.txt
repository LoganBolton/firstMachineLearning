yeah unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awfulbr br first of all the characters suck i mean come on if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself orange sherbert is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character then they should definitely not be in the filmmaking scene poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charismabr br the wrestling in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline they make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a toddlers playtime than a wrestling deathmatchbr br basically splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone only instead of blood weapons mayhem and wrestling we get a trampoline giggling kids terrible audio and some guy called orange sherbertbr br wrestling fan or not avoid this dvd its awful
