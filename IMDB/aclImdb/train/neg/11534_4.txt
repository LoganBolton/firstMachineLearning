warning contains many spoilersbr br let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian andersons incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress  which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof br br the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thoughtprovoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed souffl√© it exemplifies why i hate 99 of british cinema it feels too long its tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes just when you think theres a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot there isnt much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of alice f off adam stares adam runs off into woodsalice follows alice adam adam i suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts what few lines there were didnt have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the fword that would make bridget joness friend shazza proud there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic oh thats terrible reactionbr br alice isnt the kind of woman who courts sympathy either shes got a great job an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sortof explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a toughasoldboots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living instead she found a group of stereotypical middleclass toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated securityentertainment system ie becoming mrs robinson to a wannabe cockney wideboy electrician someone pass me a tissue the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson in the hands of a lesser actress she wouldve been intolerably onedimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when shes sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assaultbr br i cant say that adam fared much better either danny dyer played him well as a fishoutofwater jack the lad but a good performance couldnt save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background br br this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end as for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes on a side note only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on  talk about stiffupperlip taken to the extreme if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then im not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week br br saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit i didnt care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion i want that oneandabit hours of my life back please
