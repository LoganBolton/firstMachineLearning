gillian anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun after a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked after recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revengebr br i thought straightheads was terrible violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant if i didnt dislike the phrase a great deal i would call straightheads a video nasty certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980s frankly i dont know how straightheads got a cinema releasebr br i am not a prude i dont mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both straightheads had neither no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid luckily straightheads went nowhere fast it was only 80 minutes longbr br it was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third how often do i say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly what a shame i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film she especially is very underrated and is still particularly fitbr br if you want to see a good british revenge movie rent or buy shane meadows dead mans shoes it is a little masterpiece last weekend i should have seen his this is england instead ce sera sera
