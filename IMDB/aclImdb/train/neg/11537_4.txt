id been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didnt work for mebr br the problem lies in the fact that the film doesnt really seem to understand which genre its falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well its a bit of a jack of all trades and master of nonebr br the premise as with most revenge films is simple couple meet and go out something bad happens and they get their revenge its a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years unfotunately in this case its as if dan reed thought itd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail wrong there are also a few key elements missing in this type of movie theres generally some kind of warning a dont do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but theres nothing of the sort here it just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it endsbr br theres a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing id say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film hes making instead of trying to be too clever and hell have a quality movie on his hands
