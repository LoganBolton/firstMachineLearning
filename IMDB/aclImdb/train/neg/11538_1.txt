a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand not the actors fault but the writerdirector producers financiers etc need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is profound it isnt this rape and ultraviolence unlike that central to clockwork orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding its no straw dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that im probably being a bit unfair on pete walkerbr br revenge is a powerful human desire but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effortbr br i dont think its particularly misogynistic merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details  the blood running down gas leg post rape par example its neither challenging nor confrontational though im sure the filmmakers consider themselves very daring just deeply unpleasantbr br is this as high as we can aim is this why those involved wanted to make films  i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times oh the customs but the new spellcheck on imdb wouldnt let me post until i had removed it likewise i had to remove square parentheses get it sorted imdbbr br where is the lofty aspiration the noble impulse when you look at british film  the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers carol reeds work with graham greene on fallen idol our man in havana or the sublime the third man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads the work of powell  pressburger or if you want to talk about sex violence and male emasculation look at the offence dir sidney lumet from an original play by john hopkins check out tunes of glory for something worth making that has something to saybr br unlike the foregoing straightheads is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid
