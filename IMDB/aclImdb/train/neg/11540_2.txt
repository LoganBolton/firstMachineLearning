this reminded me soo much of michael winners crappy dirty weekend with its awful english low budget feelbr br firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say demented for its ineptitude and last house on the left for its sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offsbr br this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought lets remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostelbr br the whole thing just doesnt hang together or have a point whats with the rapistss daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy
