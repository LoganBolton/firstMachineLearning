may anne reid and toots peter vaughan are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son bobby steven mackintosh and his family in london even as the visit begins toots suffers a fatal heart attack leaving may adrift unsure and questioning her life and future finding herself attracted to her daughters boyfriend darren daniel craig her actions lead to inevitable consequencesbr br beautifully filmed but for all its heralded realism and acclaim the mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant even repellent characters and asks the viewer to engage with them reid shines as may and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire but michell and kureishi have allowed craig mackintosh and cathryn bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to may as written the characters played by mackintosh and bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and coldhearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was kureishi trying to say as directed they are either unwilling or unable to lift bobby and paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness br br worth seeing for reids performance but little else a crying shame
