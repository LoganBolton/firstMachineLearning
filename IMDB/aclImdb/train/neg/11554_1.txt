this movie is an embarrassment to filmmaking i cant believe it was even listed as a comedy  not funny not only was the script atrocious but the casting people should be shot gail ogrady is just a great actress but beyond that 99 of the rest of the castouch pretty much everyone elsewow it is hard to evenwow here is the number one rule about comedy dont try to be funny there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy  none of them were used in this film canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad filmmaking in canada i realize this is technically a us film but look at the director actors location etc i just saw this on bravo  they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film again there are a lot of great films out there that cant get airtime and they show this crap
