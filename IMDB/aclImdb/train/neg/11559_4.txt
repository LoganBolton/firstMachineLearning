the night evelyn came out of the grave emilio miraglia  italy 1971br br i only watched this delirious piece of eurotosh in the way of alpha videos dreadful dvdrelease looks like an extremely bad videotransfer but from what i saw not nearly interesting enough to purchase no shames recent dvdrelease considering their excellent track record it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases and dont pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here its not taken from this film some girl holding the head of a jim carrey lookalikebr br spaghetti western star anthony steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of lord alan cunningham a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife evelyn this leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic once released cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle subjecting them to vicious acts of torture his doctor and friend richard timberlane what do you mean italian horror names sound made up advises him to forget the past and remarry but cunningham is obsessed with evelyn and even organizes a s√©ance at the castle eventually after killing some more girls he meets gladys another redhead and marries her almost immediately but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events bloodthirsty creatures strike at sir alans family killing them off one by one becoming more distraught cunningham visits evelyns tomb and discovers it to be empty soon a number of outsiders begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and lord cunninghams treatment might not have been that successful after allbr br director emilio miraglia tries to blend gothic horror with giallo conventions with limited success as usual not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in england the cars drive on the right side of the road everyone looks very mediterranean and the castle and the rest of the architecture is patently italian this is common practice in italian horror but sometimes they just take this a little too far the bad print made this even slightly bearable since its so dark you couldnt see much of the surroundings anyway but then again this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isnt really the issue a large part consists of sadomasochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber but most of the time anthony steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible overacting i guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if youre in the right mood i just couldnt take it at least not with the print i watched a pleasant score though by bruno nicolai which combines easylistening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbersbr br camera obscura  410
