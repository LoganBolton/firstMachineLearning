never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just direi stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choicemaybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a filmi found it unbelievablelacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilteda musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop aintthe acting by dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didnt fit into any genreit didnt elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspensein fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters
