lord alan cunninghamantonio de teff√®is a nutjobseen early on trying to escape an insane asylum with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife evelyn a woman who betrayed him for another man with those red locks this nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring he however is overrun by his obsession with his late wifes memoryspecifically her adulteryhe saw her naked with the lover while the memory of evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with gladysmarina malfatti who spends most of the film nakedthats probably her lone attribute since she isnt a very good actress who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right awaytheres a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worthbr br the only real person alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital dr richard timberlanegiacomo rossistuart there are other key characters in this film that revolve around alan alans cousin georgerod murdock seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victimsi mean dates while holding onto hope of getting his lords estate some day albertroberto maldera evelyns brother is a witness to alans slaughter and instead of turning him into the police squeezes him for cash aunt agathajoan c davis wheelchair bound lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors we later find that she is having a love affair with albertbr br all that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of evelyn haunting alan someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around alan and the body of evelyn is indeed missingbr br the ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after alan and gladys are married where is evelyns body and will alan go over the edge i have to be honest and say i just didnt really care much for this film its badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place it looks great on the new dvd and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable you really have a hard time caring for alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity he can be quite volatile who commits the crime really isnt that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there arent but a choice few who could be doing it what happens to alan doesnt really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument hes just getting what he deserves those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to alan as i pointed out before arent that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstancesor advantages theyd havethat would benefit them with the collapse of alans sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar i thought the editing was choppy and unexciting but the acting from the entire cast is really below par some stylistics help and there is a sniff of gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some
