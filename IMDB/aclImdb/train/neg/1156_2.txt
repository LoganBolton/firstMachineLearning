watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the nonaction  and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbocroat indie and find them fascinatingbr br the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and overorchestrated one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more conceptual which it didnt this leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems twodimensionalbr br the worse for this is the character of bill spear aka snoop dogg i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic at one point i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the characters aggressive violent and monotonal delivery the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities however one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly 70s it feels and looks more early noughties if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s his character might have seemed more understandablebr br the lighting of the film was also awkward all the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazzinfused atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too welllitbr br the tenants to me is an unbelievable film it doesnt depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or blackbr br strangely i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch his eerie clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable
