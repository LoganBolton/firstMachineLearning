i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of and those i found made this one look unmissable how misled i feelbr br firstly it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewifes daytime movie the performances are wooden every sentence is an attempt at poignant in the way that housewifes daytime movies and bad soap operas always are and it is based in that predictable and welltrodden premise that men particularly soldiers are essentially violent and incompassionate the whole movie is about the drama apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimensionbr br if that sounds tolerable or even enjoyable to you then be warned linda hamiltons german accent while quite good is painfully distracting  as is her face for some reason the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day there are few surprises but do watch for the monty pythonesque endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers knapsacksbr br i wasnt expecting action but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged what i got was a particularly bad christmas feelgood story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it allbr br watch it under the folowing circumstances 1 theres nothing else on 2 you are a fan of predictable housewife takes on men and wins tv movies 3 the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film 4 youve imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling
