i have to admit i dont remember much about the characters or the story though im not sure there was one i was soooo irritated by this movie that i had a bit of a hard time focusing on it how can you name a movie keys to tulsa and then film it in texas the flat desert country around arlington  i think that was the location in no way resembles the green rolling hills around tulsa and a celebrity in tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in obviously no one in the movie has ever been to tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it hadnt anyone at least seen rumblefish or the outsiders i know this sounds picky but i cant help it i watched this because i love james spader and i usually find eric stotz interesting but even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meanderingand mean story of selfinvolved people who are not in tulsa im sorry it cant be more expensive to film in oklahoma what if to live and die in la had been shot in toronto would that suck well so does this
