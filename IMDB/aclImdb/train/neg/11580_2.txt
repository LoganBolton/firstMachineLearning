if you want to see a mystery dont watch this though there are elements straight out of elmore leonard territory this comes closer to an episode of dynasty since the filmmaker focuses on character development  ie long boring talks between stupid uninvolving characters some people can make fascinating movies without real action see exotica but not this one avoid it especially if you like the actors involved in this one
