i am glad to see most other people here dont think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but thats it there is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand filmsbr br the story involves nothing but unlikable selfcentered chainsmoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to likeand most of the public cant stand br br the oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood 101 and the story is depressing
