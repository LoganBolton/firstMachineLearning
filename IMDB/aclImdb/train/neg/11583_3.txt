this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first halfhour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing thatbr br if you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isnt worth recounting not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the scriptie i thought it stunk a look at the credits will show you that theres a pretty strong cast here used to no avail most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadnt seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger thats about all that i can find good to say about this picture
