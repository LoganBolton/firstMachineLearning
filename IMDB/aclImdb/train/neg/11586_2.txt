a nightmare on elm street the dream childbr br this is a bad movie theres no escaping it i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies but even being a fan i cant help but see this movie is mediocrebr br theres not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters by now they had just given up they dont even try they are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollarsbr br the story doesnt grab your attention its so simple its almost absentbr br alice a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant freddy is coming back through the babys dreams at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother and thats it br br the story advances slowly since theres so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting in fact thats the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool br br the characters are so uninteresting we couldnt care less for thembr br the girls are as unattractive as possible the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group ive seen better actors in school plays its embarrassing reallybr br lisa wilcox still manages to bring some class to this she is beautiful sexy and has some talent but the material just didnt let her shine what a pitybr br stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to renny harlinÂ´s brilliant direction in dream master he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension harlin and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be foundbr br the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel its the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name br br the end for the once scary freddy its too sad to see him now a clown thats not funny a bad joke goodbye freddy
