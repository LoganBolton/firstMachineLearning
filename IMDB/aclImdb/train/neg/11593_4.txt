i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series it was so boring that i couldnt remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over it even tires me to write a review on itbr br okay 4 was a joke and freddy was the joker 5 tried to return to the roots of the series it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4 which is a good thing basically they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares because of that nightmare 5 the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors maybe with the exception of lisa wilcoxbr br the plot freddy killing lisas friends by using the dreams of lisas unborn child has a good base but it just isnt enough for 90 minutes of film sometimes the story gets very confusing maybe because there isnt any and you cant stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself let me say that i dont like cheese though even if i am from switzerland not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4br br dont bother to rentbuy this film if not for completeness its quite a messbr br my rating 410 get used to it 6 is also a messy one
