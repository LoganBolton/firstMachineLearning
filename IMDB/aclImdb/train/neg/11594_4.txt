like freddys revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesnt go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wisecracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy br br  ive not alot to say about this its moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series
