the dream child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage the only good films in the series were wes cravens 1984 original and the third part the dream warriors of 1987 the second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence the rest of the film consists mainly of our razorclawed maniacturnedjokester yelling stupid oneliners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a superdumb eerie childrens rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel in short no originality just a decline of the old formula and an overload of painfully annoying jokes my generous rating of 310 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel freddys dead which is awful beyond belief in case youre not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast the dream child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint
