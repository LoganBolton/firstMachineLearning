when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddys revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series yes theres the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing super freddy but even scenes like that arent used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boringbr br this marked the official death of scariness to the series freddy seems to be the comedic relief nowbut to whatbr br my rating 410
