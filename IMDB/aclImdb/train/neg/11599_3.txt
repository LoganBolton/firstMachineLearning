the only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches br br moderate spoiler alert death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in twilight zone the movie which delivers death by cartoon still this was handled nicely especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped outbr br additionally there is one other good scene with a demon motorcyclebr br having said that i was glad i got the dvd cheap at a store going out of business sale because this was pretty awful i bought soul survivors at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream however  where soul survivors has nothing to redeem it or have it make any sense this at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to abovebr br interestingly the dvd lets you go to the 8 nightmares where something actually happens which is the only way to watch this the scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearablebr br 3 out of 10
