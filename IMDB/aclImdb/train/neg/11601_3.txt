a nightmare on elm street the dream child the fifth installment in the nightmare on elm street series and the worst sequel ever in the series even worse than a nightmare on elm street 2 i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street dvd box set for my birthday and i watched all the sequels the dream child was the worst without a doubt i was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels but i guess they just lost the charm the story was just ridicules and i wasnt happy with where it went alice just became more annoying shes not nancy or kirsten so her carrying this film on her own didnt work for me freddy is also loosing his scare this was just getting a bit sillybr br alice is back and shes carrying a child she couldnt be happier with her life but freddy is also back and hes not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie but anyways he wants her child and to be born into the world again did you ever wonder if freddy had parents too well thats what a nightmare on elm street the dream child investigates and alice soon finds out what freddys childhood was like and that maybe thats the one thing that can defeat himbr br a nightmare on elm street the dream child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series i dont think anyone could be happy with this sequel just the story was really silly i mean it could have possibly worked but once again it was just executed the wrong way i know that if youre looking to see the sequels for the nightmare on elm street series you should watch it but i really wouldnt recommend it its not worth it at least in my opinionbr br 310
