if this guy can make a movie then i sure as hell can make one toobr br in fact if you hire me to make a movie for you i promise to do the followingbr br 1 i will add more naked women this movie had none i think cheesy bclass horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body i wouldnt want to let my viewers downbr br 2 i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out its only a dream i think horrorvision had about 4 of these scenes and considering the movie was only like an hour long the dreamtomovielength ratio was quite high and if i do decide to do a dream sequence i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on i mean who sleeps in leather pantsbr br 3 i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for bigbudget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine br br 4 and finally i will not mix modern technology with the undead i mean a palm pilot can only be so scary  at least they turned it into an evil rollypolly monster before the screen blew up or somethingbr br so if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production count on me wannabmovie director extraordinaire
