no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer after all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much sinatras modus operandi on setbr br i feel that as the 1960s wore on the quality of the mans films really started to tank the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martins matt helm series which came out at the same time perhaps even a james bond competition but nothing really worked for frank during these years his personal life in shambles his music fading outsinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950s the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryans express in 1965
