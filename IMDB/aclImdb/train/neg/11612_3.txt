detective tony rome frank sinatra returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time its a film thats played for ermÂ…laughs while on a diving trip rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain waldo gronsky rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone the portly sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy raquel welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project the frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera director douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles theres even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality its a shameful shambles
