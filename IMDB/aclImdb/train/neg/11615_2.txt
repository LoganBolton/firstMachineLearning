though not a fan of sam rockwell i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of joshua heck i wasnt even aware he was in joshua until i started the movie so it goes without saying i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads a sort of rosemarys baby the omen or any other demonic kid movie joshua was billed unfortunately it fell flat slow incredibly slow and flat yet i continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing and what a lowlow budget movie or at least thats how they designed it a person falls  you dont see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab  you dont see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up im not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom a workaholic father attempting to balance everything a kid  joshua who maymay not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days shes alive  and what was that about are there rats above or is it joshua is his mother nuts is joshua crazy is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family is he going to grow up to be michael myers or does he drive his family to the brink i dont think so they were nuts prior and no socalled acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut im sure that might have been the idea but for petes sake give me something anything there are plenty better kidgonewild movies to explore joshuas more like the minime of the antichrist
