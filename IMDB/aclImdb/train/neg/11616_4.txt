i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhaps it is because i saw another much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps its really just because this film was not very good i am going with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesnt mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring uneventful and really didnt leave me thinking anything more than that wasnt very good when it was all overbr br at the end joshuas motivations are revealed i wont give that away but the reality is that he didnt really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother abby disappearing about 34th through the movie all arrows point to her returning home soon she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshuas fatherher husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically so shouldnt she be coming home soon wont joshua have failed wont his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon i question the father since his future is left open endedbr br at the end of the day i didnt care about the characters the evil demon child joshua wasnt really scary the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring suspense fell flat every single time when it was over i couldnt believe i had sat through the whole thing br br 410 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil child go see orphan now thats a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie
