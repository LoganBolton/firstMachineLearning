i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe its my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology is it a weird retelling of the oedipal myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him i didnt understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if youre only going to eat takeout why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around i see lots of good reviews for this moviehas my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s bmovies and old sci fi flicks
