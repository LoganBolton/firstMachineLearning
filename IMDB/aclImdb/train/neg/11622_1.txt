dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love wanders is probably not the word i should say he fixates on the past girlfriend he recalls to the day when the relationship ended the dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions he fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went im not a counselor but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him did i mention how creepy dave is he sometimes refers to himself in the third person he doesnt move his arms when he walks either its just weird too make a long story short dave plots to hunt down mary the old gal friend and kill hererri mean confront her he does so which was really creepy he believes her to be married yet he still flies halfway across the country to meet her he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressionsi heard another dave  mary song
