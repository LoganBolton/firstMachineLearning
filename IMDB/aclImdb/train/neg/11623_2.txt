from everything id read about the movie i was excited to support a film with a christian theme everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done especially the writing without good writing a movie doesnt have a chance the writerdirector said in an interview that he didnt want to give away how the title relates to the story believe me it was no big surprise i kept waiting for the teenageyoung adult backstory to unfold but it never did as someone who has gone through a divorce i was very disappointed this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian
