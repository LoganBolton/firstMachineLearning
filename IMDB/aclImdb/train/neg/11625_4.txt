except for the brady variety hour this was some of the hokiest television ive seen in a while the video production qualities werent too bad but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80s and marie osmond looks like she did battle with the avon lady and lost big time way too much eyelinerbr br it was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans danny kaye and eric severeid take part in this even more interesting was watching alex haley talk about the african pavillion in world showcase that would be opening in about a yearbr br as of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasnt opened yet unless you count disneys animal kingdom all in all though for all the shortcomings this still an interesting visual piece of disney history
