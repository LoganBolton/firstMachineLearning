this may be the worst show ive ever seen aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler it just isnt funny or entertaining in any way it is very similar to a 1950s sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in i love lucy its just not funny here i think the show was based around the novelty look its hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brits had us beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about lincolns slave the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer chances are youll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd
