wow you guys are way too nicecornycornycorny that is how i feel about that filmit started well with a good idea  a guy edward asner escape from jail dressed as santaa bunch of kids find him and believes his the real santa so the fake santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen moneythe film is like a christmas version of whistle down the wind the movie start well but gradually it becomes cheesier and cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously for example you get the scrooge type character called sumner rene auberjonois whos a total douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish he treat his son so bad that he dont even buy him decent clothesthe poor kid wears jeans with holes in it but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing christmas carol and giving his neglected son a hugyep that is how corny it is im all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of seasonal tv movie but this one is way too over the top for meit is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just dont match with the rest of it its not totally badthere are some solid acting  especially from the children but there are plenty of better christmas film around
