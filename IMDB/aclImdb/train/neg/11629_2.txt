spoilerskhamosh is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shahs character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how manybr br spoiler beginsbr br at the end the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shahs character to run up and shoot himbr br spoiler endsbr br it is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim oh shtbr br overall a baaaaaaaaaaad moviebr br rating  out of  2 out of 10
