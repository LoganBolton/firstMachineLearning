i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival with the great dr uwe boll in attendancebr br the film is simply put very very bad and no not in the usual uwe boll so bad its actually entertaining way but just plain bad the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life because of a past criminal record apparently cant get a job and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife this man turns to his cultleader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violencebr br the acting is awful except for dave foley who really tries despite it all the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion and people taking a poo its supposed to be satire but im not sure of whatbr br think airplane but done by the creators of south park and without any jokes
