okay this is gona be short and sweet reviewsomething the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it wasbr br this movie is  theres a good reason there was a petition with over 40000  signatures all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from franchises people liked blood rayne being a biggie therebr br the jokes are goodif youve never heard them a thousand times before the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that i even a few moments wonder if theyre even using a scriptbr br the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games hello if youve played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular theres way too much story for such a stupid movie like i said i wouldnt even steal this movie and for the person who says this is  funniest movie of 2007need to take a look around the news is better than this
