uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content so as an adaptation its a successbr br unfortunately its still uwe boll we are dealing with here so dont expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have its moment postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit throughbr br at its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points includewell pretty much everything elsebr br after the initial surprise wears off postal simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternitybr br this probably would have worked as a short movie but its just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 410
