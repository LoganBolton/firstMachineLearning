spoilers im always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews it was awful the script and voice acting alone ruined it gabriel and grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game you almost pray for their deaths and worst of all there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the beast withinbr br the lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing if youre expecting some kind of anne rice style vampire story forget it this games story has very little to do with vampires you wont even see any till about the very end and even then you wont get to fight thembr br the story has radical and pretty much blasphemous views of christianity im amazed it got off the drawing board im not even christian and i found it offensive mostly the story centers around a search for the holy grail and buried treasure the kidnapping of a royal baby which should have been the focus really gets pushed aside there is no sense of urgency for gabriel to find the baby in fact he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocksbr br the graphics are pretty bad the characters move about at a snails pace even on the best of systems they are chunky and outdated and its hard to go from the fmv of the beast within to this horrible game engine for blood of the sacredbr br the relationship between gabriel and grace takes an awful turn too i really dont know why it was so horribly rushed but they do sleep together and its not fun gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend mosely how he thinks of grace as more of a sister and he doesnt think shes the one for him and he seems really grossed out that they slept together but hes so unlikeable throughout the game that you almost dont even care at that point his dialogue was the worst in the game and he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game by the end of the game grace leaves him with what appears to be a dear john letter i guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players werebr br i found the story to be annoying and boring i was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires and i was expecting to get to see and fight vampires maybe even have gabriel or grace turn into one but no instead the story focused on the authors warped vision of christianity what a shame here they had the elements for a great adventure and instead we got thisbr br for me the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end we do get a few action style puzzles at the end but it wasnt worth suffering through the entire game to get to thembr br i cant really recommend this game i had gotten it back when it came out years ago and i hated the game engine so much that i shelved it for years i only recently dusted it off to see what id been missing and now im very sorry that i did my favorite characters were ruined i hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series and i hope they get it right next time it would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment
