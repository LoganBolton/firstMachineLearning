fashionably fragmented yet infuriatingly halfrealized characterstudy an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a potsmoking womanizing rabblerouser we never learn why these young men are friends they may share confusions about the world and their places in it but they dont seem to have anything else in common making his directorial debut jack nicholsonwho also cowrote the screenplay with jeremy larner based upon larners bookdoesnt introduce us to the characters with any clarity nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen there are some very decent performances here particularly from newcomer william tepper in the central role but most of the picture is unformed perhaps intentionally sketchy or unsure bruce dern plays the harddriving basketball coach karen black is the older married lady tepper is having an affair with and michael margotta is teppers wayward friend in an offputting overthetop performance nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor preferring i assume to let the character interaction dominate the films tone his script is no help either and as a result it is unclear whom were supposed to sympathize with small random moments do work a supermarket fight between tepper and black dern visiting tepper in his dormroom all of the scenes set on the court however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess hoping to juxtapose an allimportant bball game with a sexual assault nicholson shows no style at his craft nor does he earn points for chutzpah as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly when a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors one has to question his motives in doing so perhaps if drive he said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste unfortunately the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie 12 from
