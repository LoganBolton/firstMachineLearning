pier paolo pasolini or peepeepee as i prefer to call him due to his love of showing male genitals is perhaps the most overrated european marxist director  and they are thick on the ground how anyone can see art in this messy cheap sexromp concoction is beyond me some of the stories here could have come straight out of a softcore porn film and i am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal often pointless stories anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb oddity should really sink his teeth into the der schulmaedchenreport softporn german 70s movie series because thats what decameron looks like to mebr br besides the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels from start to finish br br 1 editing an example at 1 hour15 minutes45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place it was supposed to be placed about a minute later but i guess that pasolini must have hired boozedup editors who have little time for the fine details of moviemaking peepeepees fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally  which i very much doubt besides even if that were true that would be even worse because that story gains absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow this isnt exactly eraserhead or one of tarantinos brokenform films br br 2 acting vey sloppy triple pees fans all 8 of them proudly declare how 3po uses real people instead of actors arent actors people or are they martians sure many actors have subpar iqs but does that mean we should treat them with contempt other directors have used amateurs and succeeded such as alan parker or de niro so why are ppps amateurs so utterly awful in his movies the answer is once again appalling sloppiness pasolini is sloppy in everything and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can he is a lazy director an imperfectionist if you like the antikubrick i suppose peepeepees principal goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible and young men that are to his liking in pasolinis world there is a simple formula lack of teeth  strange face  realism its all well and fine to have them toothless but at least try to eke out some at least semidecent performances out of these inexperienced neothespians otherwise youre an amateur yourself  an amateur director in pasolinis case whether 3p0 wasnt capable of this feat or simply didnt care doesnt change anything who knows maybe he didnt even notice the awful acting br br 3 audio the synchronization if 3p0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when filming a movie then he ought to have at least made a concerted effort in postproduction ie getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio so that we the viewers wouldnt have to watch mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the moviebr br 4 lack of concept we have close to a dozen stories which arent connected in any meaningful way some are antichurch more on that later while some are merely sex yarns ie cheap male sometimes gay fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else the stories and characters are not amusing if at all on an intelligent level but on the basest level 10 yearold kids can laugh here and there is nothing wrong with that but then dont call it exalted intellectual art br br 5 as a result of point 4 there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories that goes without saying peepeepee could have arranged the order in any other way and we would have had the exact same movie this also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning etc decameron is like a bowl of spaghetti that way when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want it makes no difference at allbr br 6 the pointlessness of the stories resolutions most stories end with a cheap gagjoke ie some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comicbook whereas some stories dont even have a conclusion they merely end finito at best the stories are watchable semianecdotes barely any deeper meaning there  unless you find deep meanings in a porno there is of course nothing easier than looking for and finding meaning where there is an absence of it hence even any hardcore porn film can be philosophizedmused over endlessly its easy and fun try it oh ye 8 ppp fans br br as for the churchbashing some viewers get all excited about his attack on catholicism and whatnot in principal thats all well and fine  after all im an atheist myself  but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that pasolini was a marxist its like the pot calling the kettle black a marxist criticizing the church for hypocrisy and stupidity where does he get the nerve besides pasolini wasnt an atheist hence his highandmighty and selfrighteous stance isnt justified after all marxists are believers they merely substituted the accepted god with the idea of a utopia which is merely another supernatural wishfulthinking fantasy hence i cannot get excited about ppps antireligion anticsbr br this sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with pasolini saying rather pretentiously i wonder why produce a work of art when its nice just to dream about it he wasnt actually referring to this silly little movie as art was he in case he was  the poor deluded man  then i have to wonder why he didnt just leave it at dreaming and not make all those bad moviesbr br wanna read my altered subtitles of bergman movies email me
