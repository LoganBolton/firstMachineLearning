the tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while i was studying cinema so imagine how i was forced to watch it in complete believe me going through hell is much much easier our professor told us that this is some film  but he never thought that wed disagree or assume the apposite i dont think that there is any gods on earth were only humans so all the filmmakers therefore they can make mistakes bad movies or very bad too the main problem wasnt that art by all means is susceptible to endless points of view but that a lot of people just dont get it that every single human got his own genuine taste his own opinion hence what i suppose it the greatest movie ever made can also be your worst one ever and how that is right both ways but how many people can understand this correctly so my professor believes in this movie and simply i dont however the only way to evaluate this thing is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this societys mentality imagination and nature to tell you the damn truth mr pier paolo pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place the movie is so ugly i cant stand this so how about analyzing it then discovering the potential beauty in it  its beyond your mind hideousness and strangely not for the sake of the movies case or anything its for the sake of the unstable vision of pasolini his work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent the deadly cinematic technique the effective sense of silliness and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious look at the atrocious acting the unfruitful cinematography the awfully poor sets  oh my god ive got the nausea already it can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor there are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this so originally how to continue that just to review it fairly  actually you dont as this very movie doesnt treat you fair at all there is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera  im trying to connect some things like that with pasolinis end as murdered
