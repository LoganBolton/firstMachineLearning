though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccios 14th century decameron story collectionbr br set within a medieval italian towns largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in timebr br given the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists  as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic churchs rulesbr br nothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions
