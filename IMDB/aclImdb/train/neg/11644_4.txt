yeah i get pasolini and his milieu but at the same time i feel his decameron is largely overrated and more than a little disturbing overrated because the supposed realism he introduces milling crowds crumbling architecture etc are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave in the pursuit of realism pasolini utilized many nonactors but their deerintheheadlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly offkilter and inconsistent feel and frankly  many of the toothless misshapenlyfeatured people are painful to look atbr br and pasolinis decameron is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content not because im prudish or homophobic im neither but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neorealism he otherwise espouses so it comes off as gratuitous and forced one can almost hear him say oohive got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might preferbr br the disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in pasolinis decameron struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller rather than being an aspect of neorealism he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction even the pasolinis final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find pithy why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter  to me it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way in my opinion a far bettercrafted film and with more homosexual content is fellinis satyricon it is also full of bizarrelooking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas decameron fails by those same elements
