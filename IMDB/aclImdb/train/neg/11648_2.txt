as if there werent enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori 1973 which i had watched earlier this year the marqueevalue name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters apart from not looking minimally sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl antonio sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster  apart from being a resistible leading man his relationship with savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latters spirited teenage niece besides for a gangster flick theres precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled furthermore the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else incidentally the bargainbasement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members  or even the films title  is ever listed
