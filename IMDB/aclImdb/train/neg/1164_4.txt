i dont know where to begin so ill begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie alive combines the tension of vincenzo natalis cube with kitamuras own versus i have not seen versus so i cant comment on that but i think cube was an excellent movie which i recommend to everyone however in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredombr br ill just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy swiss cheese of a plot its also moldy cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you dont know the plot beforehand so it doesnt matter if i have misunderstood the plot dont hit me  its probably because i had to struggle to keep my eyelids openbr br so the american military in nevada once lost a ufo i the nambi desert this apparently makes sense because theyre both deserts so surely theyre practically the same place different continents or not a monkey broke into the ufo and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert what ever the alien thing is now passed on to anyone whos bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host the japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host the researchers daughter to some other dude but instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are bloodthirsty and already on the militarys side they decide that its probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the nonlethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted i dont know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though its not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity billbr br then the movie turns into what the matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour and oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives then everyone dies the endbr br the only one moment in the movie where i didnt want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest and hes hanging around up there and another dude walks by the dude hanging on the wall says im in pain shoot me and the living dude looks at him and its not like hes a mean dude or anything so he really looks sorrowful and doesnt want the guy on the wall to suffer so he shoots himbr br rhetorical pausebr br in the stomach gee thanks a freakin heap
