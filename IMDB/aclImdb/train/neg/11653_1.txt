the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you laugh it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to ripoff this time the jokes seem used and overdone the audience that i saw it with only reacted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep
