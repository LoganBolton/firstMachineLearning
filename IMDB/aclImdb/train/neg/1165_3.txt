ill keep this short as i know i dont need to say muchbr br alive is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning the film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that i completely lost interest as i said i know others enjoyed it but i found kitamuras alive to be anything but  a lame extremely boring drama disguised as a thoughtprovoking action scifi flick i felt like i was suckered into watching this film based by its intriguing premise and uberexciting cover artbr br my suggestion pass it up for kitamuras far more enjoyable freshman effort versus or his 2004 riot godzilla final warsbr br and dont get me wrong im always up for a good thinking mans film but this certainly wasnt it there was nary a moment that i actually cared about a single event taking place in this overlypreachy dialogueheavy moviebr br if you wanna talk about something talk about boring
