basically this is an overlong unfunny actioncomedy first of all id like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie 1 and the sequel had its moments unfortunately white chicks doesnt even deliver half the laughs br br the humour in it is absolutely crude if you like burping farting stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this when it isnt crude its idiotic the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me totally unfunny simply idiotic br br however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend otherwise i wouldnt have bothered the story is undeniably thin it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film the laughs dont come quick enough some jokes are dragged out too long when theyre more disgusting than funny in the first place if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie airplane hotshots 1  2 br br 110 completely unfunny thin storyline a film that seems to be based on one idea ie what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film but simply didnt have enough material
