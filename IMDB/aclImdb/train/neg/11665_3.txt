i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesnt need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdombr br however 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear  understand 2 there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the fword which is the only reason this movie was rated r 3 the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated longlasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long 4 i will not recommend this movie because of 5seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the sidecharacter it applied to or the film  it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main characters mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazis won the war i dont know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazis won wwii
