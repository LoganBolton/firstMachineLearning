this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing mannerbr br the approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie beauty can be only experienced in bobrossstyle kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending eg at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless bullshit quotebr br i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades
