i enjoy a good slowmoving drama christmas in august chungking express virgin stripped bare by her bachelors the way home springtime in a small town hana bi eat drink man woman dolls in the mood for love and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films  just to name a few br br unfortunately there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves these are what i call ian films  incomprehensible artistic nonsense tsai mingliang is the king of this subgenre and vive lamour is his masterpiece in fact this is the crème de la crème of crapinfested garbage under the guise of art people walk around in their apartments drink water stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant hang posters staple papers together go to the bathroom eat do pushups have sex slap at mosquitoes etc im not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless arthouse trash there is no plot no storyline no interesting or noteworthy events no emotion no meaningful dialogue and most importantly  no dramabr br the most eventful scene has two people banging on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress  ironic that its also totally tasteless and gratuitous the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically nonexistent tsai apparently didnt feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang the person under the bed is just as onedimensional and uninteresting he likes to drink water makeout with melons and stroke himself this is tsais idea of character development a truly misguided entertainer indeedbr br tsais true contribution in vive lamour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in arthouse film history he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another 356 consecutive seconds the film then abruptly ends no point no entertainment just pure concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer br br in an effort to beat a dead horse the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom in fact kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo and guess what its actually interesting that film moved as slow as molasses in january but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive lamour kairo is a perfect example of thatbr br fans of cinema may thank tsai mingliang for directing this film as he has provided irrefutable evidence that arthouse cinema can be just as poorly made as bgrade madefortelevision horror flicks arthouse snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of selfrighteousness the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and  gasp  showgirls how do you like them apples
