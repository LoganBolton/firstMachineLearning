need i sayits a stinker i gave it a rating of 2br br only watch it if you suffer from insomniabr br theres plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroines well being a few disagreements slight raising of voicesthats pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldnt happen to anybody  the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that pointbr br the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing motherdaughter type relationship that the older woman craves with herbr br it turns out the older womans daughter cassandra is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces togetherbr br even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why hes still hanging around years after cassandras death is a good questionbr br theres also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everythingcooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently locking the doorsince that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith isbr br theres nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there is no mounting tension in this filmjust bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to timebr br
