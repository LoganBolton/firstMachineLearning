no movie with madeleine carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable that said i have to add that this british film comes close the story takes place on board the ss atlantic and its loosely based on the titanics unfinished voyage the word unsinkable is spoken the liner strikes an iceberg and we hear a heavenly choir sing nearer my god to thee the doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem in a clever bit of sound work but the year of the films release 1929 means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage these arent problems the films major flaw is pacing and pacing had been well developed in silents however if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed the movies running time would be cut in half the intended effect was drama and clarity in a new medium but the result unhappily is tiresome now the films structure is preposterously illogical and inept paradoxically i found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique fine abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another sometimes even on sound effects although were on board the atlantic from the first shot we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before i discovered that fact there are long intrusive musical passages by the ships dance orchestra entertaining easy sound personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way dont even think of spectacle the berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ships hull is a minor dent however the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats  clearly staged on a real liner presumably tied up to a dock  generate great excitement other than the glorious miss carroll these sequences are the films only points of excellence as the movie and the ship near their end the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail their last eternal blackout is the end of the film with a sunsetsunrise tacked on a clumsy symbolic effect atlantic is a cinema curiosity at bestbr br
