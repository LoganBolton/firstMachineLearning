this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the uk and usa br br its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch br br watch it if nothing else is on tv but youll probably get bored with after awhile
