for me an unsatisfactory unconvincing heist movie with an alist cast particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like spike lee i was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie subgenre for a start i didnt like the pacing of the film starting off with mastermind clive owens raison detre piece to camera unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion then finding the narrative peppered with confusing not to say unrealseeming witness interviews then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier of course the camera work is fluid throughout constantly on the move and incorporating handcamera shots aplenty but director lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film denzel washington is weighed down with the clothes and badass jive talk of a shaft movie thirty  five years earlier he even has that noone understands him but his woman thing going on replete with his hot girlfriend baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate dirtytalk and his mild in the heat of the night riff with willem defoe in almost a bitpart raises barely a ripple clive owens plays his character with a resolutely english accent even as were given to believe the gang is arabbased also hindered by having to play 90 of the film with a mask over his face jodie foster delivers another of her patented tightlipped ice maiden subclarice starling turns as a well connected financial bountyhunter if you will to little effect overall its a real mishmash of a film with a light but obvious twist at the end in fact the title gives it away from the start spoiler fans worst scene of many is undoubtedly washingtons witnessinterview unbelievably with an 8 year old streetkid although owens dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes during the film injoke references are made by characters to classic heist films like serpico and dog day afternoon  but theres no honour in selfpraise more like the hot rock insteadand even that was good for a few laughs
