first this film is not a thriller neither is it gripping taut it might have been so based on the script but the directions slow pace makes it difficult to get intobr br the plot itself is very interesting and ingenious unfortunately we only get a sense of how ingenious after the picture is over that leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that dont grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligencebr br i wish this had been the fastpaced thriller the box promised it wouldve been an outstanding film instead spike lee made it plod along through the end
