this is a dumb movie maybe my judgment wouldnt be so harsh if the film didnt promise so much but i just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turnbr br i didnt have any beef with the acting but i thought the characters were awful the movie starts off with clive owens character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later oh yeah he also tells us hes in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and youre long gone before the police show up but clive owens scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours  for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as i can tell he also has to control hostages negotiate with cops and most fantastically of all perform a thisoldhouse job on the banks stockroom and hide out there for a week i hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me clive this plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didnt fall apart was the screenwriter said sobr br and then there are the many unexplained details why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages who the hell is jodie fosters character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesnt have to tell denzel washington her agenda because its above his pay scale how dumb are these cops that they cant figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery how did the robbers slip away and why did clive owen stick around for a week how did they find out about the bank chairmans past and the number and contents of his safe deposit box why the hell would clive owen let in jodie foster or the cops since when do they make toy ak47s that look real up close how the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway how did clive owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours undetected did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop denzel to slip him a diamondbr br none of these questions are ever answered there are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen offscreen but i never felt that way about inside man it felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and thats weak particularly annoying is jodie fosters character who wont disclose what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is were just supposed to take her word for it i guessbr br the only reason i gave this movie two stars is i laughed at denzels taxi cab and pina colada gags and at the kids outrageous video game other than that this movie has no redeeming features
