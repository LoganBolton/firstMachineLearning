movie there are some very interesting comments on imdb about this movie its truly awful not enough money is spent on the movie and the way spike lee has made it it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick charactersactors denzel has done exactly what he does in every movie so no surprise there here is a little mind game for the readers quickly think of 10 denzel movies now count how many of them were in which he played a copdetectivebody guard whatever clive owen hmmmmmm this guy needs a better role on his plate soon his best performance was i think in beyond borders other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well his tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in sin city surely this guy knows acting what he doesnt know is better way of choosing roles he is in desperate need of a better agent jodie foster was brilliant in the movie if you are watching her for the first time in your life she has done better she has had better roles it so happens in hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as jody foster did in this movie plot plot was not confusing in fact i could think of such a plot in fact the whole movie while taking a dump after a nice big chinese dinner i mean come on spoiler on the way i am sick of the unnecessary haulocast and the racism token the movie is about bank robbers why put the haulocast and the racism in there nice try playing with peoples emotions worked on anyone not me police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages riiiiiiight please were talking about us police force and security here nobody could find out where clive was i mean they didnt find anything different with that room whore we kidding conclusion sure go watch this movie if nothing youll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was at least people wont think youre stupid to go watch this movie because theyd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast mistake
