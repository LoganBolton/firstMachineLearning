i have never seen any of spike lees prior films as their trailers never caught my interest i have seen and admire denzel washington and jodie fosters work and have several of their dvds i was however entirely disappointed with this movie if this film is any indication of spike lees ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others br br i wonder if some of the other imdb commentators watched the same movie that id seen i can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of spike lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work i only paid 250 in a second run theater and still felt id wasted my moneybr br the imdb trivia page says it allbr br  shot in 39 days  how can you expect to shoot a big budget blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time no wonder there was such a weak performance by allbr br  ron howard was first going to direct the film  he may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits br br ok maybe not im sorry this film was so rife with pitiful clich√©s implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldnt have made much of it hey ron be sure to thank russellgood call br br  jodie foster filmed her part in three weeks  and it showed her portrayal of a fixer who makes peoples problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given did she even want to be therebr br other peeves br br  how many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and hed better keep awayor else br br  when detective frazier denzel washington comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him br br  det frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me why then in their brief struggle didnt he even try to expose the robbers face that may have gotten the response he was looking fora robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification and why did it take steve stevie steveo the robbers accomplice so long to come and help out br br  i understand that these werent your typical bank robbers they had a different agenda and didnt want anyone harmed but the cops had no reason to think that they wouldnt to them it was a desperate situation why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas were they not taken down first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield is this spike lees version of ny city or snls taking them down would have reduced the bad guys numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up if not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside give swat something to do or send them homebr br  what police department in this country would have allowed madeline white jodie foster to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first she had no authority no governmental credentials and besides this was after all already a hostage situationadd one morebr br  why wouldnt the bank ceo christopher plummer just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago screw sentimentality the diamonds he could have soldbr br  who was that schmuck the character not the actor with the jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was 100 albanian but yet he himself couldnt speak itsir put your hand down and his exwife what a schlump she was both were totally unbelievable br br  when interrogating suspects why did det frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist ie  telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldnt then could then couldnt give me a break br br  who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldnt deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages br br  near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which clive owens hid out for a weekwhere did the materials come from the drywall  studs it was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself the bank employees hadnt complained about the smell all week long hellobr br  after such a debacle since the documents had fallen into the robbers hands what kind of references was ms white expecting to get from the bank ceo seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failurebr br  and last but certainly not least whats with the electric glide that denzel did how stupid was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice he looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement cheeeezheeee br br other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directingyada yada yada br br hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or notbr br
