ive seen most of ryuhei kitamuras work and ive come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage with versus and aragami kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget so what happened in alive  to be more blunt the answer would be  nothing nothing happened in alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plotbr br adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi alive is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro played by hideo sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for its hosts humanity grants supernatural powers naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro the bad thing is that doesnt happen very soon br br similar to aragami alive sets its first half in establishing the basic exposition characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered the whole thing even takes place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while aragami was just a 70 minute movie alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves arent much interesting there were some small attempts at making alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic  evil government people against superpowered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself wasnt even interesting to begin with and doesnt do much to improve on other aspects of the filmbr br now after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning sadly that is not the case the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers theyre just not interesting or fun kitamuras creativity from versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camerawork and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights a shame reallybr br evidently aragami was better on all accounts and kitamura had learned something from alive so it wasnt at least a total loss watching this movie if only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie
