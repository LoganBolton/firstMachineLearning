it seems to me that stephen kings bachman penname was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer rawer more meanspirited stuff that he wanted to write without contaminating his brand name if you look back at the bachman books running man the long walk roadwork thinner you notice they have a sealedin feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream king i realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated bloodcovered emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prombut mainstream king always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly btw pet semetary could have easily been a bachman book if king hadnt revealed the alias by then and the dark half seems to be at least partially about his bachman personabr br thinner was the last bachman book and man with its themes of class warfare revenge and death by starvation it is nasty so it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit br br what is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a tv movie of the week level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release these days something like this would probably go directly to dvd or cable the makeup work and the striking motif starving to death in the midst of plenty a metaphor for the overfed undernourished american middle class if there ever was one is all that keeps you watching this misfire br br what went wrong my first thought is that the director was going for the nasty bachman vibe but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices  the actors here with the exception of joe monetegna simply cant carry the movie and then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure plus he couldnt leave the plot alone and his changes dont really help the script and dialog ought to work but mostly the movie just lies there everything is muffled dull airless and no fun to watchwith the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character gettingthinner and thinner and thinner br br as other have pointed out thinner is by no means the worst king movie ever made or even the second worst and it does have a dreadful compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work but first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations
