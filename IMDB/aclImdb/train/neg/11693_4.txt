a fun concept but poorly executed except for the fairly good makeup effects theres really not much to it there are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once hes deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long timebr br in any case the movie has far worse problems than thatthe cinematography is decidedly lowbudgettvshow quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worsebr br the only reason why im giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last 13 or so and joe mantegnas character takes over the movie develops a fun campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel and the gangsters crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch the ending if predictable is also nicely mean avoid unless youre a kingophile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp
