so thinner yep this steven bachman read steven king yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy elder who he just killed the story itself is there no doubt about it but i dont know why i didnt enjoy it more than i could have i guess what really distracted me was the actors i mean whos the lead robert john burke whos he and fer crying out loud can someone please stop hiring joseph mantegna for every italian mafioso role there ever is and while were at it does every mafioso have to have a pasta cooking italian mother the only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup michael constantine as the gypsy elder hes pretty good but the rest i make you all better actors
