i began watching this movie with low expectations as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a sk novel  a novel i never readbr br im glad my expectations were low because the movie wasnt nothing close to good but it manages to keep you interested what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors the movie is overlong hasnt no nice shots and no scares the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crapbr br the only things good are that as i said it keeps you interested  i guess the book must be good without using much horror clichesbr br my vote 410
