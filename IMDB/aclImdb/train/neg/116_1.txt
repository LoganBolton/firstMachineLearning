i cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter bs amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn
