youll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king dont give up your day job is the standard thing to say but thats not fair king acquits himself reasonably well hes no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day jobbr br never have i seen so many dreadful performances  of which the lead actors the lead actors is probably the worst  gathered together in the one film everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go overthetop without expending or manifesting energy i blame screenwriterdirector tom holland it cant be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly ive never heard of any of them before but still i dont think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so whats more likely  that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snakeeyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okaybr br this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to cowrite a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character but thats a misleading way of putting it hes not a knowable character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that hes fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us helpfully and in the endbr br sigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning herebr br in the end he becomes evil why i can only shrug perhaps hes under some kind of enchantment yeah thats probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable  its not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary meansend psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobodys actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audiencebr br by the way heres my nominee for hammiest linedelivery i dont think youd like it in fact big dramatic pause i dont think youd like it at all
