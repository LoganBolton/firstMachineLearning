this stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring ingrid bergman that ive seen even her luminous screen presence cant save this insufferably slow and meandering movie thats nearly impossible to sit through without fastforwarding a lot of itbr br only for diehard bergman fans others are very likely to fall asleep i suggest you to watch for whom the bell tolls instead
