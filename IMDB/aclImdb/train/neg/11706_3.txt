a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a leftwing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercoverbr br its a pity theres no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalescebr br stories about leftwing refugees in france dont have to be this dull read arthur koestlers memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death dittobr br to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental detailsbr br the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film its only sold in cheap lowclass saloons vive le tabac parisien thats what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenaristsbr br i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable fullsize alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasnt disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze muralsbr br the films indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known  if you can call it that  for his opera the emperor jones based on the oneill play it premi√®red at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though theyre running out of potentially marketable operas to revivebr br opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyers character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidencebr br namedropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarques earlier all quiet on the western frontbr br well the injokes are all in place guess there wasnt time to develop any drama
