as a fan of eric rohmers studies of the contemporary war between the sexes i was very eager to see the lady and the duke langlaise et le duc for how he would treat men and women during a real war the french revolution br br the film looks beautiful with each scene designed as a period painting like a tableaux vivant and i expected much talking as thats rohmers style but maybe rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real womans writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of the scarlet pimpernelbr br as awful as the excesses of robespierre et al how about some recognition that the french aristocrats were spoiled brats i kept humming to myself marat were poorand the poor stay poor you could also pick a tune from les mizbr br i wasnt all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the revolution at one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast i simply didnt understand her an english sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution keep shifting political focus i think i was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations like a character out of the scarlet pimpernel hey the only reason she didnt go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the prince of wales or somebody br br usually in a revolutionary period theres some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women but i saw none here i once went to a herbert marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy q  a the last question from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes heck she had gray hair was why are revolutionaries so grim she was hooted at and marcuse didnt deign to respond to it seriously  but its the only thing of substance i remember from the whole evening rohmer demonstrates that counterrevolutionaries are also grim and didacticbr br originally written 8112002
