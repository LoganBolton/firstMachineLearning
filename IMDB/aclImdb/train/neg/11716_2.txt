after watching this i thought to myself there are either too few good writers  directors or lots of producersbr br at any rate this is a terrible movie terrible in a way that its not fun but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver makes you shout this is wrong at the movie immersion is zero by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errorsweirdnesses in movies that has computers hackers etc in them this movie is like that in every aspect br br the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily brilliantly played by eliza bennett i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth somethingbr br do yourself a favor dont watch this there is not even proper action in it total waste of time
