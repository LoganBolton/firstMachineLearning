in the words of charles dances character in this film bollocks no plot no character development and utterly unbelievablebr br full of stuff that just doesnt happen in the real world since when were british police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters full of mistakes bulgarian trains in london full of dull and artificial dialogue and the directingediting is awful  wobbly handheld camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness confusing jumpcuts no structurebr br wesley snipes character is totally unsympathetic  why should we care what happens to him direct to video direct to the dustbin
