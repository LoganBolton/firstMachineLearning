this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the realworld the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schoolbr br i do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationbr br i do recommend this film to the average or belowaverage mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationbr br it is a total waste of what little production value it has
