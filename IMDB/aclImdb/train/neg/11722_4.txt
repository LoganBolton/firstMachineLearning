the problem with the contracter is summed up by the opening scene  the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin james dial  the terrorist is appearing at the old bailey court in london which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if hes going to spend the rest of his life in jail  hes going to be out of circulation either way  didnt the cia have a chance before he was arrested  if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him  theres no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison br br since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire  dials colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi theyre driving in crashes but dial manages to escape  so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash  the film of this type of plot connivance  later dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying  this airport is surrounded by armed coppers  yet dial manages to escape very easily without explanation  the whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained  this includes an important supporting character called emily day  why does she help dial even though hes a wanted fugitive  your guess is as good as mine br br this is a fairly poor thriller and dont be taken in by the  big name  cast  wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films  charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien 3 but again hes someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days  and hes basically playing a cameo role anyway  the likes of lena headey may go on to become big players in cinema but theyl certainly fail to put the contracter on their resume
