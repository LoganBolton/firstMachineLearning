have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more even from a score of 58 imdb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting dont waist your time this movie Ã­snt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedybr br i give this 210 it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isnt
