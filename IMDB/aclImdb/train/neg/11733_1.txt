im shocked that there were people who liked this moviei saw it at tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed major revisionit didnt even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that theyre snortingthe next scene theyre hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it also the ending just took the cakeim not going to spoil the magnificent conclusionbut it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plotscriptsee this movie for comedy if you must
