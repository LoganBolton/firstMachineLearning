well i dont think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be   but theres no denying that its got problemsbr br mostly the problems are in the script theres a plot  but not much story and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible it trots out any number of selfconsciously strange andor stereotypical characters lines moments whathaveyou and by the end it just hasnt added up to much in this departmentbr br sorry but i couldnt care less about whatever social ill farnsworth might be trying to address there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia or whatever it is those morons do so as a film you wont find me calling iowa important but at a stylistic level the picture is more than interesting and some of farnsworths choices in depicting a methheads wiggedout state are beautiful hilarious disturbing and  yes im going to say it  inspiredbr br the acting is uneven but that just may be a casualty of the aforepraised stylistic reaching look rosanna arquette is a fine actress  but shes not very good here so a discriminating audience member does have to ask what happened its weird that diane foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near for example i might seriously consider whatever explanation farnsworth could provide for michael t weisss overthetop turn as a probation officer but i doubt id ever buy it it just doesnt work br br then again its the most alive and in the moment that ive seen john savage appear in years so go figurebr br this is the sort of work that tantalizes but does not promise  and thats okay neither farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies so whether or not farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen but if he does it seems pretty likely that it wont be bland pap in an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of american idol perhaps we could allow not scorn farnsworths legitimate and undeniably flawed film br br what is more perhaps we could welcome not berate his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination
