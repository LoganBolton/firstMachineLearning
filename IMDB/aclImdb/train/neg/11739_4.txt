the oftenreliable leonard maltin says this is a delightful romance and that sanders is superb maltin must have confused this movie with something else sanders is snide and droll and superb as usual  you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three but dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately the storyline itself an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief francois eugene vidocq who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette and certainly the deplorable forever amber which screams for a classy remake though in his defense sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character it is all for naught i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan but this is 1946 and it is one of sirks earliest american efforts lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid breastheaving potboilers sirk is just getting his feet wet here and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession and hit his stride bombarding us with such estrogenfests as all that heaven allows written on the wind and imitation of life but scandal in paris is hardly his best work  a relatively lowbudget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming
