if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over2hour movie about the french revolution and also didnt have any sets and had to have my 4yearold autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didnt make the auditions of that years soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didnt work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldnt stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet mistakenly hilarious hellworthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duelspace laser battle i dont mean to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it but thats not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace
