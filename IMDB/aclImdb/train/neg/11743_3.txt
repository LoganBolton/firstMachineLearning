i really cant say anything bad or good about this thing its characters are likable enough its capably produced and designed and professionallooking except for that cheesy monster suit however it has no originality no ideas and nothing you havent seen in alien predator armageddon andor outland its just another formula cookiecutter grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster flick pretty much a waste of time
