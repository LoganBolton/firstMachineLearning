after finally viewing this movie in its entirety i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike is it the worst western ever no i wouldnt say that but the last great american western a phrase i saw applied to it more than once not even closebr br a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clich√©d that ive ever seen the movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life theres so many instances of this that its distracting cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable unoriginal and often br br if bad dialogue doesnt bother you then how about bad gunfights few westerns can show you gunfighting thats completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously its okay if theres a comic edge to such gunfighting such as in silverado but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score but by then i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond savingbr br other than those flaws i can say the visuals are stunning  the movies well shot and the settings all look great the acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with however if youre looking for the last great american western do yourself a favor  go rent unforgiven insteadbr br 3 out of 10
