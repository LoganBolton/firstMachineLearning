well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype from the buzz at the toronto film festival to gushing reviews on cbc radio a refreshing wacky hilarious indie movie apparently id been looking forward to it for monthsbr br how can i put it this simply it sucked in a very big way an exercise in cinematic lameness that makes adam sandler look like a comic geniusbr br at best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing an amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle messbr br and what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track that was about the only truly odd thing about itbr br if you want to see a genuinely funny bizarre movie involving aliens then try repoman there is no comparison
