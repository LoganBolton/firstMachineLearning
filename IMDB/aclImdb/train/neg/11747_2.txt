although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one  its an ultralow budget canadian film two  its written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless its woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possiblebr br in a nutshell  bad script bad acting terrible directing dont waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music blaring throughout how this got any attention ill never know
