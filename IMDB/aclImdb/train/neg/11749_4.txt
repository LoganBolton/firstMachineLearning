phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlinesbr br at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didnt find the jokes or oddness funny anymorebr br its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interestbr br i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partakingbr br for something similar but better try brother from another planet
