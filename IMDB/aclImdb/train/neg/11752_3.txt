i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isnt easy and this just didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didnt move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didnt score that well with them either
