i have to admit that im a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold fathers or something more interesting but nooooooo a maniac wants to destroy arnolds house between many other places so many people tries to stop thisbr br i must admit that the plot wasnt so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for god sake and to worse everything they make supermoves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not arnold gerald and helga cause they are experts on a video gamebr br honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon i must admit that i used to enjoy hey arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on nickelodeon but after this crap of movie im not quite sure if im going to watch hey arnold as i used to watch it on the pastbr br other thing nickelodeon with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode i think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that dont do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be goodbr br honestly i think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie
