i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy waybr br gael is absolutely terrible i mean he just cannot act period he should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing his costars are about the same caliber im sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them the director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous somehow i dont think an oscar is on the cards for this guybr br i have never written a comment on imdb but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do sobr br if you get the chance to see this film dont 010 if there was a 0
