for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the 1980s this isnt it nor is it a historical drama rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to sinclairs idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus lincoln superman and nelson mandelabr br on the other hand there are a few laughoutloud moments as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt you know like jesus would have done if he hadnt been such a wimpbr br true i saw only the 98minute version but i cant imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been betterbr br and what kind of a name is mungo
