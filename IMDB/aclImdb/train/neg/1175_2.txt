much has been made of rohmers use of digital technology to fill in the background at times it works well the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the kings execution is particularly striking at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video however the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters to be frank i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the dukebr br the other major failing i regret to say is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience also watch her hands when she is expressing emotionbr br all in all a very disappointing film particularly given the positive reviews on this site
