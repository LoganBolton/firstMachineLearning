amen to magsel there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are purchasing henry cele stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the miniserieswhat a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david hasselhoff spelling is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film where was his english accent and whats with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young mans rise to military power  not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddybr br if i had paid more than 7 for this movie i would have to call the police  because that would be a crime
