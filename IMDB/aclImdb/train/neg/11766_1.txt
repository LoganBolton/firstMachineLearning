its difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because i think the problem begins with the books themselves alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist hes done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan  not as successfully but based in as much factbr br once i realised this it ceased to gall me that jill scott an american singeractress is cast as mma ramotswe if she is to represent a land that is not africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african shes not the only american on the cast mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose both women are far far too young for the roles theyre playing and far too glamorous both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting scotts mma ramotswe is bouncy cute and soft roses mma makutsi is an annoying motormouthed bitchbr br the result is almost unwatchable the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this  hes a shining light in an ocean of suckage the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the scriptbr br to me mccall smiths writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad he refuses to be edited as a result his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change name midsentence it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worsebr br the dialogue is now largely anglicised characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly mma makutsi moans about not having a computer but given her constantly restyled hair makeup and jewellery im surprised she doesnt have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa cardbr br so what are we left with here its difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute nonthreatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdomnuggets it reads well despite linguistic travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were it just isnt truebr br given that its hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice however
