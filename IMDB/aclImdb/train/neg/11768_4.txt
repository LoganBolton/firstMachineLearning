this reboot is like a processed mcdonalds meal compared to ang lees very good but very underrated 2003 the incredible hulkbr br ang lees the hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person the hulk takes some time to appear about 40 minutes but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonists core he does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes itbr br now compare this to edward nortons turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute not 183 not 197 but exactly 200 to this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of midichlorians in the phantom menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test in the 2008 movie all ed nortons bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist and for the record it is extremely difficult to get ones pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run especially for a physically fit personbr br emotions drive eric banas hulk he has repressed memories of his mothers death and his fathers role in his early life on the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed but the hulk never kills intentionally even his attackers mostly he just wants to get away or close to betty ross jennifer connelly he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collisionbr br in the 2003 movie the visual effects are there but as necessary the action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of actionbr br in his quest to turn it into a fugitive story ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk to him the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry and louis leterrier the director picking up on ed nortons cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the bannerhulk relationship the story can be summed up as banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt banner is pursed and hulk kick butt repeat as necessarybr br the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version however even as i am a fan of the comics i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboys dream but has heart over the comicsloyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any daybr br perhaps ang lee should have read more comics iron man also released in 2008 is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comicbook roots and has heart
