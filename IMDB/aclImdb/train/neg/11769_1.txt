somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and ill start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wowbr br spoilers for ang lees hulk and the incredible hulk br br was it boring i almost didnt make it through ang lees hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and thats no fun hes usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his nondescript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics  and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his nonangry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie everbr br but then something happened about 34 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and  dare i say it  reasonably convincing  extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good thats not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didnt require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of nonsuperhero action movies and thats quite a featbr br of course the ending got really stupid with bruce banners father turning into some sort of shapeshifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron mans brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expectedbr br ok but what about the incredible hulk guess what its boring too it has just a few appearances by the hulk and heres the thing  the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lees version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others  but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didnt even look like a living creature just some sort of computergenerated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didnt look 5 years newer than ang lees they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever couldbr br worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lees failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly onedimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though hes only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesnt do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lees version the incredible hulk was slightly more fastpaced but since nothing really happened anyway thats not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk hes actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster br br this is how i can definitively say ang lees version was better if i ever have the chance to see ang lees version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely id just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience  at least in ang lees version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of coursebr br it is absolutely mindboggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lees hulk by making almost exactly the same movie br br it is to edward nortons credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film
