p or clubp should really be called l for lame every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its muchhyped logline thai lesbians fighting monsters rather this is the tale of a khmer country girl whos grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd but specific rules dont walk under a clothesline dont eat raw meat and dont accept money for your powers well guess what folks the girl moves to bangkok to raise some money as a bargirl and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the foreign johns who pay for her servicesbr br while this film cant even be released in thailand due to its controversial subject matter most american audiences will find this hohum horror pic a cross between showgirls and interview with the vampire as directed by walt disneybr br if not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the mpaa could probably rate this for preteens only there is literally broadcast tv adult fare although youd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a thai porn star in real lifebr br as for the lesbian angle theres one brief smooch and a couple of i love yous to prove that the two main stars really are a couple on brother and the pbar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts theres a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girls mouth  ooh phallic imagerybr br no nudity no real monster unless you count a five foot high thai spirit with yellow eyes and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on dvd youve been warned
