this was shown as part of the 59th edinburgh international festival though for reasons best left to the powers that be a lot seems to have been made of the fact that its the first thai language film made with thai actors  crew but directed by a westerner neednt have bothered to be honest as this film is dull dull dull why hint at something why shroud an idea in mystery why subtly invoke a feeling when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs obvious shots and over the top scenes nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director spurrier clumsily churns out endless clich√©s no hinting no guessing its all up on screen no need to use our imaginations wonder when the scary bit is coming no you wont cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating rising to a crescendo of ominously hell im making up words to describe how bad this is wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary why tax yourself  its really is a snake and yes its really is biting his crotch and theres blood splattering everywhere its a strange uneasy film for several reasons its supposed to be a horror film but its not scary  the jolts are signposted  obvious it might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of thailand yet the director has a sleazy lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens maybe it was casting himself as the virginitytaking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head or maybe the whole thing was just pants uninspired insipid repetitive hackneyed  all candidates for best description but dull seems most appropriate and honest its all been seen before probably better often with more thought rarely with less imagination or flare sorry thumbs down on every count truly dire
