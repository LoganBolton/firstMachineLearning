made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the edinburgh film festival it was well shot from the outset but thats the last positive comment i have about the film the acting was awful i wonder if actual gogo girls were hired but it was the plot that was truly laughable in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason i gave this 310br br  spoilers below br br i just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughingbr br shoving the girl in the field who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly a real eyeopenerbr br the getting on the bus scene the girl is getting on the bus but according to the music the world is endingbr br the rolling under the clothes line wow this one really demonstrates the plot writers skills in the room followed by raw meat and skill selling why not just get her to perform all three sins at once at least then the film might have been slightly shorterbr br the running down the stairs of the mall watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating dau no wait  she is just walking quickly trying not to break her nailsbr br the running covered in blood this is definitely my favourite scene and a fitting end to the movie a half marathon in red paint completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car not only this but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film now thats sticking to character for youbr br id like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates sadly having met the director at the presentation this is not the casebr br but if youre in a sarcastic mood and fancy a laugh with a few mates then still dont even think about it
