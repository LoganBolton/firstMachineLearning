and finally old old michael corleone falls over and goes thump who really did the writing for this last installment of the godfather saga probably the same staff who does as the world turns this flick doesnt deserve the title godfather at all lets call this one the cosas of our nostras or all my capos as someone whos encountered a number of mafia people in my business life i can say without exception that ive never met any mobster as inwardlyconflicted and contemplative as michael corleone lets face it these guys are in the mafia solely because theyre greedy nothing more in this film don corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future perhaps even the afterlife then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is deep down then theres his failed marriage after the breakup scenes in g2 we may hope that michael  kay will reunite as man and wife but here they seem to just become very good platonic friends who can laugh  cry  share intimate thoughts about their lives its as if the screenwriters try to make michael into a woman its bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years theres some miscasting here and there or perhaps theyre sins of authorship poor oldcountrybeautiful sophia coppola is saddled with a hopeless role with too many short lines in the film that dont fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations  was given remarks rather than lines to emote her passionate lovemaking scene with andy garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their openmouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettesscullery sex was brought off wonderfully by glenn close and michael douglas but its just laughable here then theres andys character vinnie mancini whos also given a difficult  thankless role to play hes expected i guess to be the new new don corleone but hes almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position unlike michaels simultaneous hits on all 5 families in g1 this handmedown process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a mafia family but why is so much made of this boring routine certainly don vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday but theres little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man sadly puzo did such a fine job of quickly  concisely developing michaels character in g1 but g3 has no economy in its storytelling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze thirdly george hamilton was also handed a thankless task in taking over as family lawyer after robt duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as tom hagen george wisely underplayed his role so it came off without damage to the actor the development of connie corleones character is interesting but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands she could well end up sleeping with the fredos if this were the real world but its not all bad the assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty also they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line and we recover some oldcountry feel as we get to go back to sicily even if its all done in 1989 and theyve got modern cars  haircuts the plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the catholic church are pretty interesting since its based on some actual financial shenanigans at banco vaticani in the 1980s but its brought too far again with the toospectacular death scenes etc the grand opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed but the death scene of mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotionalmanipulation at best all screenwriters need to learn that we dont always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion you feel sorry for kay that her daughter is dead she plays her grief so well but michaels reaction is hammy hammy hammy then michael dies sometime in the 21st century in sicily alone on a grand estate of heartfailureno grandson to play with before his demise no wife to grieve for him what should have happened in the last 12 of this movie is michael being tracked down by someone like rudy guilliani put on trial all his dirty familys sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day michael then convicted under rico statutes and sent to federal prison for lifethen he can keel over dead from heartfailure while mopping a floor in leavenworth thats how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80s and early 90s and they got much better treatment than what they deserved
