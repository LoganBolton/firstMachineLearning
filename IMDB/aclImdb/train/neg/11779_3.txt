i dislike this movie a lot if youve read the puzos books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one youre going to agree with mebr br compared with the corleones saga presented by puzos novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the moviebr br it is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleones saga in the 90s and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i dont know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didnt fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original films qualitiesbr br what will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario puzo shouldnt have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzos novel the last don is a 90s story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii
