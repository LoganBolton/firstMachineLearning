near the beginning of the godfather part iii michael corleones son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician michael corleone does not want this but his estranged exwife kay manages to convince him to let anthony corleone pursue music as he wishes so he doesbr br that seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action just bear with me here youll see where im going with this eventually now let me tell you about the major plot it is about michael corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business but then along comes vincent mancini an illegitimate nephew who is involved in a feud so of course michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff meanwhile vincent has a semiincestuous affair with michaels daughter mary oh and michael and kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of part iibr br it is like a soap opera one horrid awful 169minute soap opera gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard after a 16year break in the franchise francis ford coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films once again proving his last great work was apocalypse now back in the 1970sbr br whats worse the godfather part iii isnt even a logical followup of the godfather part ii michael is a completely different person he hasnt just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if itd be no fun to watch hes become a goodygoody thats trying to fix all the tragedy that made part ii such a devastating masterpiece his confession to the priest was bad enough but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating he also gets back together with kay for heavens sakes there is absolutely no way that should happen as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear she aborted his baby and his sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it didnt francis ford coppola even think of these thingsbr br and dont even get me started on mary and vincents affair for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging sofia coppolas acting did nothing to help she made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture nominee every line she delivered was painfully memorized and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities all she elicited was inappropriate giggles in the climactic scenei wont go into detail but youll know which scene im talking about whenif you watch itshe looks at michael and says daddy i think i was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long loud laughterbr br now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why i took time to start the review with a description of anthony corleones musical ambitions after 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances anthony corleone returns with an opera so michael kay mary and vincent go to see it and for about 1015 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate michael about this climactic sequence i must say one thing it was really good but not because of the killersthey were pretty boring i just really liked the opera it had some great music and real great set pieces and from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the corleone familys origin ill bet it was one swell opera and ill bet michael corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to musicbr br my biggest wish is this that francis ford coppola had merely filmed anthony corleones opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama better yet i wish he hadnt made the godfather part iii at all part ii gave us the perfect ending this spin off was selfindulgent and unnecessarybr br ps this is not a gut reaction to the film i watched all 3 godfather films over a month ago though i was rewatching the first one not only does this mean that my expectations for part iii werent screwed in fact i had set the bar rather low for it after what i heard but it also means ive had a good time to think about all three films while i was a bit disappointed with part ii at first the more i thought about it the better it seemed but with part iii it was bad to begin with then got worse the more i thought about it the sad thing is that many people will stop with part i but if they watch part ii as well they will most likely go on to part iii if you have the will watch parts i  ii and pretend like part iii never existed
