the show had great episodes this is not one of them its not a terrible episode its just hard to follow up the man that was death all through the house and dig that cat hes real gonebr br this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy ammanda plummer and charles stephen shellen in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion charles soon finds out a secret of peggys familybr br in my opinion you should watch this episode but just dont expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season
