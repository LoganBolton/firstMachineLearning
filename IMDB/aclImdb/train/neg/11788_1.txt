this was one of the worst movies ever it was so bad i was laughing through the whole movie the plot was so cheesy especially the end this movie turns from an endoftheworlddisaster to savetheeels i mean cmon and i sweari think they use sock puppets for the eels and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced how predictable it was so terrible that my mom my sister and i couldnt finish it and when we did finish it it was about a year later the second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did mst3klike comments throughout the moviebr br summary only watch this if youre a movie basher make hilarious comments watch this at a sleepover for laughs and i mean huge laughs also watch for mockery the metaphor that explains this movie this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets
