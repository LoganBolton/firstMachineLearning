completely ridiculous period film is only a thin excuse for its extensive graphic depiction of the heroines affair with the beast a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women thats pretty much what he does and the films depiction of the beast is really really awful its basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge pvc tube for a hardon that squirts copious amounts of white liquid for fans of fake animal porn i guess maybe this is a real turnon i was amused however by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square
