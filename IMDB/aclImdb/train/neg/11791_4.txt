i dont get this the movie obviously has a pretty good budget it has very good cinematography it has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too then why oh why didnt they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that cant act their way out of a paper bag this movie could have been good at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at allbr br so i would say its a good production but a bad movie too bad actuallybr br and eels come one really
