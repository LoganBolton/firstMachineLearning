deep shock plays out like a tv movie a whole cast of commercialquality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do withbr br i checked out the movie because of the creature i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos and right off the bat i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie the actors i expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point the music was typical notthoughtout action symphonic musicbr br i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the minisub design the movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set youre watching the story unfold in but there isnt much of a story here anywaysbr br this movie gets a 310 stars imo the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting itkinda lame even lamer is the taggedon love relationship between two of the characters that you dont see coming chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors careers off the bench and into a video dont bother
