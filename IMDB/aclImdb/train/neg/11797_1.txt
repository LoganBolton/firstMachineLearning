watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life if nothing catastrophic happens before i die this will be the biggest regret of my life who ever even thought about this movie or financed deserves a kick between the legs because thats where they were thinking when they made this movie its about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry he joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast where they meet girls and such only the fat guy doesnt get a girl skin flicks dont annoy me i take em for face value but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick its about fat guy looking for love in some girl but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry he finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies only he has his lady anyways the dialogue is superhorrible for even a c movie it supports a ton of black stereotypes no character development its a glorified porno movie without any porn in it never ever watch this movie
