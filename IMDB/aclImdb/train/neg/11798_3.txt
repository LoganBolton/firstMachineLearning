i watched phat beach on cable for a while and i sort of enjoyed it the fat guy is the best character as he seems to be a nice guy the rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men i like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the years attitudes and fads phat beach is also funny because the lowbudget babes in this movie are strictly homegirls most lowbudget movies have that local babe quality and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for jc penneys some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really overused highmileage skank there were some cuties too that is the charm of these lowbudget crappy movies you will see a lot of doggies and some real cuties i checked up on some of them at imdb and seven years later phat beach is their only credit too bad it would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return what happened there are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on tv you wonder what ever happened to x anyhow this movie mostly blows but it has some funny moments
