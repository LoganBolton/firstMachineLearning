it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doingbr br some of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didnt go on to star in more and better films sadly i didnt think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film rolebr br the film appears to have some fans and i was very openminded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cats meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this onebr br it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovichs exgirlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball linesbr br bottom line it aint no paper moon and only a very pale version of whats up doc
