murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to the end of the linebr br tv was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated madefortv knockoff hurt my eyes it cant possibly compare to the 1944 billy wilder film noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know sight unseen but that doesnt mean this update should be seen as a separate entity either although based on the original paramount screenplay theres over half an hour cut out and the directors bland indifference makes whats left imminently forgettable with rare exception the younger generation wasnt interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in 1973 still true today alas so this lurid compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers then as now ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison detre gus van zandt remade alfred hitchcocks psycho for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels so much the better i loved the james m cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair halter tops turbans ugly decor and lush auburn locks of guest star samantha eggar who didnt try too hard in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube lee j cobb was able to hold my interest as a worldweary tiredlooking keyes but richard crennas affable and inoffensive walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a bad day improvement upon the original was of course never intended in a rush to make a buck but instead of a mindless retread a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea cains book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer the completist in me is thankful this speeded up me decade update was included as part of the double indemnity dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original it had me nostalgic for any episode of the bettermade columbo tv series i also flashed back to a very good 1973 abc tv movie of the week that i havent seen since its initial airing john d macdonalds linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lovers sexy john saxon wife and then frames her mildmannered husband for the crime and if i remember correctly theres also an openended ending like double indemnity it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband
