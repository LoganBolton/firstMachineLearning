as a big fan of the original film its hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment dont fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting characterhe does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks cant hold a candle to barbara stanwicks velvet voice and sex appeal lee jcobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyesbut even his performance is just gruff without stylebr br it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
