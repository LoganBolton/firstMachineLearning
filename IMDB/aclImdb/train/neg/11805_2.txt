watch the original with the same title from 1944 this made for tv movie is just godawful although it does use as far as i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesnt work is it the acting the poor directing ok so its made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original especially as youll be spoiled to the plot and wont enjoy the original as much as if youve watched it first br br there are a few things that are different from the original its shorter for once but all are for the worse the actors playing the parts here just dont fit the bill you just dont believe them and who could top edward g robinsons performance from the original if you want only watch it after youve seen the original and even then youll be very brave if you watch it through its almost sacrilege
