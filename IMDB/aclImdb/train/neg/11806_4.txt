it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie that to me and many others is one of the greatest film noirs ever made realizing this is simply a shortened madefortv film and that most people had trashed it i didnt expect much but you cant help but compare this with the 44 film scene after scene i found myself comparing what i was looking at it and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray barbara stanwyck edward g robinson and others now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna samantha eggar and lee j cobbbr br when it was all over i found it wasnt as bad as i had expected but its no match for the 1944 original the two main areas in which this madefortv film wasnt as good were 1 the electricity between the two leads was missing and 2 being only 90 minutes they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot characters and chemistry between those leads crenna and eggar were flat and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as walter neff and phyllis dietrichson respectivelybr br where this remake held its own was in the other characters such as barton keyes and edward norton cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton head of the insurance company it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed so the houses cars telephones dictating machines etc were all early 70s instead of mid 40s otherwise the storyline was very similar just rushedbr br however one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film
