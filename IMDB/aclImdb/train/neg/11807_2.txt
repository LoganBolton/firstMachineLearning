when samantha eggar as phyllis dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be she doesnt have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck and it is not entirely eggars fault in the original film wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house and she doesnt come out she appears almost as if by magic walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor there is a reason for this stanwyck is much higher than neff fred macmurray when they are first introduced it is not just the towel the towel adds to the seductive allure her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation she has sexual even magic power this person is no ordinary housewife this person is a mystery with secrets hidden withinbr br back to 1973 the remake has crenna knock on the front door stanwycks standin eggar answers the door with a towel around her there is no appearance she simply opens the door the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 she opens the door with a towel around her it may be sexy in a charlies angels sort of way but its not nearly as mysterious the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilders point the script may have said phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel the point is not the towel the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis and the potential power she wields wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because thats what wilder did and in the choice of shot lost all of phyllis mystiquebr br richard crenna also seems miscast he seems like hes acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70s actor he cant get into the 1940s when macmurray first speaks into the microphone sweat begins to drip from his face no sweat on crenna and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning in the original neff says i didnt get the money and i didnt get the woman in the 1973 version crenna says i didnt get the money and i didnt want the woman did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story or were they dumbing it down for a television audiencebr br this madefortv movie is a bythenumbers rendition all the sharp edge of the original is lost the only standout maybe is lee j cobb in the role made famous by edward g robinson but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tvmovie made probably by the same people who did gilligans island they might as well have tried to remake citizen kane or gone with the wind if mediocrity is the best one can hope for whats the point the 1944 classic is a film with a capital f this madefortv remake deserves an f grade or maybe a d for dumb
