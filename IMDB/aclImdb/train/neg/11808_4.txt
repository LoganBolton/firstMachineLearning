this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film double indemnity is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script this gradeb tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize blackandwhite films and sought disclaimers on widescreen movies that are shown in panandscan versions the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remakebr br the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script the billywilderraymondchandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified timeslot with room for commercials then update the production with bland color photography smart upscale sets and tvfamiliar actors thus the brandnew double indemnity eliminates the atmospheric blackandwhite filmnoir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original gone are the dusty shadowy claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists desires to escape their situations at whatever cost gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllisbr br the look of jack smights take on double indemnity is more dynasty than film noir phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for and neffs comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesmans salary not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry 200000 if not money then perhaps murder for love or lust not in this version richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff and his attempts at doubleentendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind only lee j cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better workbr br there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a doubledisc package the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting lackluster direction and tv grade production values the 1973 double indemnity should be titled 10 indemnity because viewing it only underscores the 100 perfection of the original movie
