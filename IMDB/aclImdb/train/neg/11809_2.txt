bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for 2 i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good onebr br the movie is quite cliche 1970s and is quite groovy for that unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie in fact i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it wasbr br the movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and waitfor thembr br if you are into b movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did i mention not much story line eitherbr br
