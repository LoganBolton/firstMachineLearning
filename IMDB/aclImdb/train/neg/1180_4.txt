notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned its obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey its often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cant back the legend up with substancebr br the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama br br once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fastforward thru the banality but its not really worth the effort the nudity doesnt go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamersbr br try as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt its worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed
