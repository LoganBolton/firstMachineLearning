before stan laurel became the smaller half of the alltime greatest comedy team he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies many of which were parodies of major hollywood features following a dispute with anderson laurel continued the informal series of parodies at joe rocks smaller and more indigent production companybr br most of laurels parody films were only mildly funny at the time and even less funny for modern audiences who havent seen the original movie which laurel is parodying west of hot dog is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shootemups its marginally a specific parody of west of the pecos an oater released two years earlier with no major actors since west of the pecos was never a huge success its difficult to see why stans film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it and where did they get that title west of hot dog possibly its down to the fact that hot dog was a sexual interjection favoured by american lechers in the 1920s as in the opening scene of the stage play machinal br br west of hot dog was produced and codirected by joe rock among his many other achievements rock introduced laurel to lois neilson and he was subsequently best man at their wedding full disclosure in the last years of his life i had the great privilege of befriending joe rock and interviewing him nearly ninety years old at the time rocks memory was impressively clear  but he remembered nothing at all about west of hot dog and i cant blame him this movie is eminently forgettablebr br the leading ladys character is named little mustard if thats meant to be a parody of something in west of the pecos i dont get it there are a couple of impossible gags here including laurels method for mounting a horse for just one moment in this movie stan laurel reminded me of the great buster keaton when he suddenly broke into a run west of hot dog is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to keatons short comedy the frozen north but keatons version is much funnier the plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in keatons feature our hospitality but again suffers by comparison here two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the last chance saloon but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot stan however the brothers will become the legal heirs if stan dies hmmmbr br seriously though is such a bequest legal as soon as stan takes possession of the property surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision not the previous owners decision i had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedybr br at one point a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock it looks cheap and isnt funnybr br this hot dog is no weiner and no winner its just a whiner my rating one point out of 10 hang on stan in a few more years youll be onehalf of a comedy legend
