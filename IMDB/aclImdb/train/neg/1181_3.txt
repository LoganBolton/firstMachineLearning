this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after itemthe outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of filmmaking but ultimately fails in every extent its a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic filmbr br the 2 disc dvd includes a gorgeous booklet with stills interviews essays on bestiality etc as well as an extensive interview with the morethanpretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc 1 contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc 2 contains the directors cut in an awful transfer in frenchbr br what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking
