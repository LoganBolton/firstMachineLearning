encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only
