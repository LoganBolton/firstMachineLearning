just got back from a free screening and im very glad i didnt pay to see this very subpar film the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slapstick and fart jokes though good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot the movie is pretty juvenile unintelligent predictable and mostly annoying the characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at allbr br visually the film is about average with nothing that really stands out they did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from wallace and gromit but other than that its very forgettable imagerybr br although i was really bored throughout the whole film i chuckled a couple times its not an absolute failure but i most definitely would not want to watch it again if youre a parent with kids and you dont care that your kids see mindless cheapjokes then feel free to take them to see it but everyone else shouldnt waste their money
