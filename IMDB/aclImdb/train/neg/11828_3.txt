a few months ago i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster hey kmadden about this film the poster insisted that if i gave flushed away a chance i would like it based partially on that argument i agreed to watch the filmbr br flushed away has good intentions at least on aardmans part but lacks the strength to pull it all together its best asset is sewer ratboat captain rita played by kate winselt who imo should have been the movies main character instead of roddy hugh jackman ritas cool tough and interesting while roddy spends much of his screen time snivelingbr br one of the things that bothered me most about fa is the repetition of jokes that arent funny to begin with when roddy gets hit in the crouch the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately my names shocky says one of ritas brothers who then electrocutes roddy at least three times my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time lowbr br i wont waste time griping about katzenbergs kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar one similar films a coincidence fives a rip off but i will say im disappointed in aardman they can do and have done so much better try harder next time guys
