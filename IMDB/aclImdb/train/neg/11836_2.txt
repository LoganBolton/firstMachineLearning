ultimately too silly and pointless yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that forgettable instantlybr br animation is as we have come to expect superreal the plotline could best be described as thin but tenacious although the ending seemed arbitrary to mebr br the sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too oh yes and theres a romantic interest with the female being the smarter more savvy and gogetting of the pair  this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome anti stereotype probably your kids will love it though
