if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel  and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time then this is the documentary for you admitedly i didnt watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism but that was enough for me maybe the rest is even betterbr br i wonder how long its going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies perhaps game shows based on selfmutilation might be nicebr br i already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen i dont need to see the proof on the tv masquerading as entertainment
