the cats meow contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some fine performances a few of which surprised me eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies though why movies never use her reallife stutter is difficult to explain but these elements dont add up to a successful whole the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenesthe meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well craftedbut not so hard on the big picture several minor characters dont need to be there and dont behave consistently the basic plot is full of illogic eg why does thomas ince think its a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesnt want to hear and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome id like to think a trip on hearsts yacht was more fun than the movie indicates davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type which isnt really accurate and the screenwriters ideas about chaplin and love are implausible br br strangely bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the thirties in paper moon lacks a similar affinity for the twenties he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period eg yes we have no bananas when hearst insists everybody charleston charleston it looks as if the actors had a tenminute dance lesson just before the scene was shot br br the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies im sure but not this time
