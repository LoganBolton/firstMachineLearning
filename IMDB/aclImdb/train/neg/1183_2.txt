this and immoral tales both left a bad taste in my mouth it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex as a film its not very well done  some of the acting is truly epically bad such as the american woman with the french accent the young womans sudden flipflop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way around and the aunts sudden realization of the young mans secret dont make sense  theyre not explained at all i also didnt like how the daughters relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her familys perversion or predilection for bestiality the central idea the idea that theres this sexy beast if you will that lives in the woods could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty sexnegative morality play
