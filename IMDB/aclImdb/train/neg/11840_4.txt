anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events were about to see cant ever be known and this is the whisper rumor most often told about one of hollywoods most sensational mysteriesbr br okay so were not getting anything new and es mysteries  scandals gives you a better foothold on the particular incidentand thats not much of an endorsement what do we getbr br we learn that hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents no big news there more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry andor political establishment it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters but whats told is so cynical and ugly and muddled were left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as historybr br the tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun were not empathetic with anyone and the great citizen kane polishes off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way in the cats meow were not ever sure of davies motives for being with hearst as soon as were told one thing shes off doing the otherbr br and are we to believe that davies was the love of chaplains life or is he just trying to cockold one of americas most powerfuland apparently moroniccitizens the film never makes it clearbr br what is convincing are the production values theres a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the mens jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most wellknown personalities in hollywood history no one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction the disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfyingbr br the performers cant be faulted although meg tilly goes way past parody here kirsten dunst never disappoints she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing only joanna lumley rises above the material but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it one of her first lines is im not here and im sure she wishes she wasntbr br this isnt on par with bogdanovichs trashy sobaditsgood at long last love its perched on attempting something serious but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because its so full of bitterness towards the beast named hollywood this is national enquirer filmmaking and it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the oneida that weekend but the audience gets pretty dirty as well
