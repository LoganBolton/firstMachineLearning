after seeing this film i complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty for at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20s music and the scratchiness of the soundtrack i was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so  it was the directorbr br i was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film the music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film these days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the samebr br so apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film which you can find out for yourself elsewhere the soundtrack distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss you will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the soundtrack and certainly not a cats meow
