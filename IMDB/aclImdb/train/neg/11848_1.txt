what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is in fact a headache inducing tale about a bunch of characters the only big actor being ginger rogers in a very early role all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean as a cheap low budget production most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man some guy i dont care who he is cause he really sucked talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt honestly ive never had a worse time watching an old brate movie of this type and ive seen some real headslappersbr br oh and the butler didnt do it because there wasnt a butler but pay attention to the guy whos closest to a butler there ya gobr br polarisdib
