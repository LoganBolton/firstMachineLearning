a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lovers apartment rogers actually has two identities at the films outset that of miss terry the dead victims secretary along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand talbot instead of her papers rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns hes been out scoopedbr br heres a puzzle  its revealed during police inspector russells purnell pratt investigation of harkers death that terrymorgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks why exactly was that after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before clues are dropped regarding harkers association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isnt relevant until its all linked up to janitor peterson harvey clark and whos making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss with the words you will hear it cut and pasted beneath apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment houses radiator system which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as mrs coby in the apartment below harker but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs cobys death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulationbr br its these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the buildings incinerator furnace however and score another point against continuity we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway but how and still pretty as a picture and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred arthur hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a roombr br sorry but for all those reviewers who found a shriek in the night to be a satisfying whodunit i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable the usual suspects by comparison if you need a reason to see the film it would be ginger rogers but be advised she doesnt dance
