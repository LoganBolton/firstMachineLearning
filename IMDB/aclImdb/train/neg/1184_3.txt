this movie had a fairly good sounding plot but the paste was very slow very slow indeed even if someone thinks this is a cult classic i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watchedbr br the cinematography is not excellent but not the worst either the sounds are ok lighting okbr br i still wouldnt recommend this to anyone else than maybe a filmstudentbr br the movie does not contain music and the horses having sex dont make it a good one either and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupidbr br no winnings here skip this utter boredom ive seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i dont get the good reviews here especially the high ratings
