this movie was supposed to have depicted a ladies man bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i didnt care for his character i dont understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or charisma he shouldve at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing but to no avail just because he is a musician does not make him sexy not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous does this man have any shame whatsoever had he tidied up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boringbr br gina gershons character was unnecessarily british she couldve just as easily been an uptight outoftowner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the moviebr br the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog now those two had chemistry academy nominations for both stat plot holes lack of character development horrible acting unnecessary drama cliché moments what a mess of a movie
