for the life of me i cant understand the good reviews on this piece of crap it was pointless matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man gina gershon well others have said it but ill reiterate why the stupid accent totally unnecessary and her acting was just bad i dont know if she was thrown by the accent or what there was no chemistry between these two br br and the girl modine was in love with suddenly shes shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way where did that come from i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly i couldnt care less about any of these people
