im a fan of matthew modine but this filmwhich i stumbled upon on cableis absolutely witless i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same so there was no one around to check her worst instincts there are no surprises no original lines and no original characters the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character what a waste of all this acting talent given how expensive it is to film in new york these days i have to wonder how this got made in the first place and if youre wondering why i watched it at all it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer its not a very demanding picture
