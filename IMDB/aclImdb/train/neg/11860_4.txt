if you havent figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes lilia is a widow she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never daredthe cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her the film is very misogamist its portrayal of men is dismal which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is shortlived not short enough i say she does find romance however brief  with you guessed itno surprises here we didnt see coming though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way maybe this film just isnt targeting my demographic 30 male
