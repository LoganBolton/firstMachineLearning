just saw a prescreening tonight what can i say it lived up to its mediocre trailer run though thats saying nothing at all it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasnt done and it played out in such a clich√© fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience and instead let the humorless movie play outbr br so lets see we have the lessthanspectacular main character that is trying to get back with his exgirlfriend but hes not good enough for her check we have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl characters best friend but is constantly rejected another friend being the super awkward one that cant live down seeing the positive in everything 247 and is thrown in for the oneliners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references specifically from disney and the third guy whose name you wont ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen check we have the girls exboyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up not to mention the awkward family members from the main characters side check we have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed check we have the movies funny moments come from incessant swearing people falling down or being hit scenes from the trailer and homosexual innuendos check and dare i call it a spoiler but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie checkbr br honestly this could have no wait should have been a pg13 movie all that needed to be dropped were any fbombs honestly it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor would have gotten less media exposure and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent rrated comedies like superbad and knocked up the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesnt fit in with what general people look for i bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera lets put it this way in the theater it will help you laugh because its on the big screen and others are laughing when this movie hits showtime and youre checking it out at 200 pm on an offday you may be inclined to change the channel the only thing that will keep you watching is alice eves hotness who is not quite a 10 but still very good lookingbr br aside from the main resolution this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie where everything else pretty much flies out the window so there is a main resolution but what comes of it its never really clearcut nor does it allow the ending to be feelgood with the abruptnessbr br there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie and that was the good soundtrack aside from the nice choice of 90s alternative rock songs there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something david holmes would mix upcompose ill give them props for a great choice of soundbr br one last thing this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer because the inadvertent yet proud pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that rock band promotion i just figured a lot of rock band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it but i say hold onto your money if this was pg13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends id say knock yourselves out otherwise definitely pass it doesnt try and compete with the rrated movies of the past few years and ideally it definitely isnt as good
