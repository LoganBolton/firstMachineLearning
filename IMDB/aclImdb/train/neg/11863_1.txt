i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was i am so glad i didnt pay to see this movie and that i didnt sit in a movie theater for this one where to begin on this movie the acting in this movie was average the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasnt special i thought that this movie was suppose to be great but it wasnt more than a cheesy waste of time i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry it just wasnt there i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didnt get the feeling that he wasnt acting in this movie now alice eve did a great job as an actress but there was no chemistry between her and jay all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie the humor in this movie was not funny at all there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldnt decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyÂ…boring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality but what a letdown nothing i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie so save yourself the agony and just dont see it
