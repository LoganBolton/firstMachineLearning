first up this film according to the slick said it won best film at worldfest film festival in houston texas hmmm must have been a quiet yearbr br wouldnt call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b grader body melt but at least that film didnt look like it was shot on hi 8 videobr br my guess is the film makers watched a lot of troma films and really bad b grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this filmbr br dont get me wrong i love really low grade films just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy bad taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad tastebr br if you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in nobudget film making watch it otherwise stay away
