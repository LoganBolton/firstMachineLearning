at first glance this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under 18 restriction filled with hyperviolence drugs gore sex including lesbian sex some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop but then this movie is a succession of bad story so thin bad acting with a ridiculous english accent making you believe youre watching a bad monty python  bad music 80s hard rock the videotaping is awful the ending is a real shame plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous the gore not very impressive and those vampires reflect in a mirror and dont even fear daylight you get to be very disappointed unless you see it as a space mutiny or troll 2 i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 because thats its real placebr br id say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beerbr br 310
