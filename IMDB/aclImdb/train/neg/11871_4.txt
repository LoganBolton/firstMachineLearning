gregory pecks acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment but the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch for me anyway i tried to like it but had to fastforward through the last thirty minutes or so i feel i wasted a couple of good hours had it not been for gregory peck i wouldnt have lasted fifteen minutes 410
