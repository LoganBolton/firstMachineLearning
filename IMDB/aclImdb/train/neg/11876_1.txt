i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though ive basically never seen such an armateur production and i mean that in all senses of the word although the physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areasbr br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying charactersbr br its a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel theres a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i dont know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution im quite bemused as to why they picked this upbr br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it ive seen a lot of films in my time and im very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much ill never forget tunnel for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame its such a low pointbr br
