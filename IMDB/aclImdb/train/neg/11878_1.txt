really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny and yet he thinks hes hilarious the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first until joshs look at me im wacky approach began infesting each and every scene the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies debaser i have just one thing to say what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to writedirectproducestar in such a terrible movie
