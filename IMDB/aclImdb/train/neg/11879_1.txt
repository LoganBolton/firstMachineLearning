my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and office space blockbuster and imdb even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked office spacebr br now ive seen office space probably 15 or 20 times i love it its probably one of my 10 favorite movies witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people ive worked with over the years haiku tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films thats where the similarity ends we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping nay praying that it would get better it didnt we couldnt take it any more and stopped the tape thank god it was a free rental id have been ped if wed actually paid for it we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it now since we didnt see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself i doubt itbr br haiku tunnel is so bad its hard to believe it ever got produced the movie is so unfunny its painful just mail the friggin letters already the premise is asinine the jokes are awful we got as far as the printer doesnt work scene and had to stop we couldnt take it anymore this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluthbr br if you are a fan of office spacedont waste your time with this turd 010
