office work especially in this era of computers multifunctional copy machines email voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temphumor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to its predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigarbr br 	as the narratorstar of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franclisco its an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isnt all that funnybr br 	kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp its a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina damore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position hes nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters hes typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on hes been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesnt take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluths days as the fairhaired boy are going to be over and quickbr br 	the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didnt and the audience wont because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows hes being funny he never is and thats exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br 	in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesnt work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use selfdeprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter its easy to understand why this one just doesnt flybr br 	the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br 	shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluths performance if only momentarily but its still not enough to save the day or the filmbr br 	the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someones comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for its destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as obscurity i rate this one 110 br br  br br
