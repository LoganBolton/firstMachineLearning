i passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if i was missing something the other night it was on one of the movie channels and i tuned in i missed nothingbr br i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 i seriously doubt itbr br the lead character starts the movie in classic i dont know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesnt want to get sued its not funny its not even remotely funny others have commented on the san franclisco bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like its the funniest thing ever written get over yourself in fact i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film dont assume familiarity with your audience familiarity is earned much like respectbr br from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp i didnt realize hes jewish its a discredit to jewish comedians to call this jewish humor its just unfunny humor just because youre jewish doesnt mean you have a knack for the comedy a wasp spalding gray does a better job of selfanalytical humor than this guy so obviously its not about ethnicitybr br if one of the bits i had seen had worked i might have stuck around but some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesnt make a great moviebr br this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of office space dont let yourself become a victim of target marketing just say no to haiku tunnel
