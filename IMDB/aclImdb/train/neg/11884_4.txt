the worlds largest inside joke the worlds largest most exclusive inside jokebr br emulating the brash and everyman humor of office space this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonistbr br the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time listening to music and writing a novel while working these are his goals you cant imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when around halfway through they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria but then gives it up the director and screenwriter jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth completely remove the audiences motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereofbr br apart from that major stumbling block the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen without these asides the audience wouldnt have noticed anything particularly strange humor is only effective if it doesnt need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny
