the world may have ended unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canadas inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable maybe its because all our really good people norman jewison martin short et al go to hollywood in fact its too bad short wasnt cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film he might have given it some credibility the canadian government should realize  and this movie is a magnificent example  that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema if the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment
