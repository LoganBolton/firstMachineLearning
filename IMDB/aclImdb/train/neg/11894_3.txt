king kong vs godzilla 1963 which i recall having rated bomb had been my introduction to cult director hondas work this one isnt necessarily better  its just that ive learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare br br here we actually get two kongs for the price of one an ugly and dopeylooking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse the simian creature lives on the island of mondo  where its shown fighting a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans naturally it falls for the blonde and bland heroine in fact more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the films villainous mad genius  called dr who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampirebr br he kidnaps king kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the element x which is embedded in the icy wastes of the north pole apparently the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart and to ensure its full cooperation who even captures its three companions the female agent then has a change of heart helps the heroes one of whom typically is a nondescript american and is killed by who kong eventually escapes and makes it to tokyo where it has a final showdown with the robot the doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub  which on a request by kongs dreamgirl is summarily trashed by the giant ape
