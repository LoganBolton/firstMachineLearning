oh my god what the hell happened here im not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in king kong vs godzillalinda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesyits about some villain called drwho who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kongwhen he doesthats when linda miller gets annoyinghe makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapesthen drwho sends the robot after himbr br later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaningas i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fightthe ending has to be a really bad one because they couldve shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs againbr br dont watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive
