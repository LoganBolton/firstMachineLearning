before i start i love eddie izzard i think hes one of the funniest standups around today possibly that means im going into this with too high expectations but i just didnt find eddie funny in this outingbr br i think the main problem is eddie is trying too hard to be eddie everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for it but in circle he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in places many of the topics he covers he has covered before  i even think i recognised a few recycled jokes in therebr br if you buy the dvd youll find a behindthescenes look at eddies tour interesting in places but not very funny and a french language version of one of his shows diehards will enjoy seeing eddie in a different language but subtitled comedy isnt very funnybr br if youre a fan of eddie youve either got this already or youre going to buy it whatever i say if youre just passing through buy glorious or dressed to kill  you wont be disappointed with circle you probably will
