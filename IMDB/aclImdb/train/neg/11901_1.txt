land of plenty is not a film it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wendersbr br many felt it in the million dollar hotel and now land of plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has wenders lost it hes actually turned into a bad director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenesbr br one might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but wenders case is extreme its as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again  only to get sloppish resultsbr br in a few words this film does not deserve your time
