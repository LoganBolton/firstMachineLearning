watching der himmel über berlin as a teen in the late 80s was a profound experience for me  so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind  a testament to the genius of wim wendersbr br unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clichés and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audiencebr br has the well run dry whatever the reason its time for mr wenders to either step it up or stop altogether
