i get it the diehl character is sposed to be a microcosm of america itself  seeing arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that its his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices goodwill to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a wellmade amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting better luck on your next flick another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger these people dont get enough to eat truly these folks arent eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger they need selfrespect selfworth dignity which you cant give a man yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available less the center for hunger in america i would say its more the center for alcoholism drugabuse mental suffering and economic devastation dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is bandaiding a more profoundly systematic societal and ageold human problem of homelessness bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul
