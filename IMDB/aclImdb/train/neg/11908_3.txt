this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies two harbors is a bw 75 minute film from minnesota that features nonactors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking outofthebox when selecting this film i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with as a matter of fact i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself not that two harbors is completely without merit but ill get to that a little later br br as is common with independent films two harbors is limited in terms of location there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer which is the home of the middleaged main character vic played by alex cole writerdirector james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic who is one of the dealers there he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors  all the chatting ive said it before and ill say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually there are exceptions of course but generally endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes dont even advance the plot one iota this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel longbr br the other problem with two harbors is the acting i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film but i really dont feel like theres a good excuse for not having good actors in your films there are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on lowbudget projects  even in minnesota many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is naïve in narrative filmmaking next to the story nothing is more important than the actingperformances if you dont believe the people enacting your story your audience is lostbr br originally i thought vculek was using nonactors but as the film went on i decided that they were probably community theatertype actors it wasnt that they were uncomfortable on camera its that they were overly theatrical ie big granted the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e johnson as cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vics extraterrestrial hunt they seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only  not coming from a real organic place within ms johnson in particular is an interesting case she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside worldbr br i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and heres what i mean without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film after that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  its like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way its almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters the last five minutes of the film dont have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle detailed cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic then with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that its based on a true story which got me to thinking with all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening rewrite two harbors might make a really kickass stage play  maybe even a oneact if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker reel 13 or whomever there might be something to this story after allbr br for more information on this or any other reel 13 film check out their website at wwwreel13org
