weak bobby pineapple salsa flay and mario batali bring this downbr br flay being the worst definitely a one trick pony i think they could have gotten other american chefs to come to the table on this one as the iron chefs the kind of dishes this duo come up with reallydont reflect on the creativity of the original iron chef series i dont think batali even went to chef school actually there are a lot of great chefs in america i just wonder why they dont appear on the food networkbr br it would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps cohosts who can handle the pressure i like alton brown but he is a bit too flippantfunny for this role
