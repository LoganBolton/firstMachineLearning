a good idea badly implemented while that could summarize 99 of the scifi channels movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill platts bad writing and directingbr br another review made the good point of needing to know where youre going so you can get there this movie doesnt its put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in bill platts vocabulary there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middlebr br this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldnt afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is thatbr br if you are a fan of shiri appleby watch this movie because shes ok she does manage to break out of her roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything hes ever done since playing q back in sttng so thats nothing newbr br in all i gave this movie a 410 rating
