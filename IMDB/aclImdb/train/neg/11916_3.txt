yuck i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written the acting is so apathetic at times and so overdramatic at other times why would a demonico kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal just for the heck of it and is it really necessary to show liliths motorcycle whenever shes out somewhere we get it you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket it doesnt mean you have to show it all the time the faiths lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance everyone is a throwaway character forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most illconceived movies ive seen the scifi channel come out with stay away unless youre into bad movies
