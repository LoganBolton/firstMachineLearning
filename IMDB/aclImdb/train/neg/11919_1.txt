this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itselfi first saw the trailer in 1991 it looked greatsince then i have always wanted to see it but could never find ituntil today yes 14 years laterbr br lets just say i was so disappointed its unreal ok i knew it wouldnt be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun nobrain film in the bloodsport mold unfortunately it was not its poohbr br whats with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frighteningbr br the fight scenes were rubbish and look fakebr br this dvd only cost me £5 and i believe i was overcharged by £7br br now im sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back
