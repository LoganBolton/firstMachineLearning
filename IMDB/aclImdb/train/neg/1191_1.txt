im a big fan of troma but i cant figure out why they bought the rights to this movie its so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesnt know hes stuck with annoying tourists well they didnt seem to bother him in the movie just mebr br the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan i like bad movies but it was just boring
