without question the worst film ive seen for a long while i endured to the end because surely there must be something here but no the plot when not dealing in clichés rambles to the point of nonexistence dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed characters never develop beyond sketches setpieces are clichéd worse considering its codirector the photography is only sosobr br comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside get carter long good friday or kaspar hauser are way way off the mark lives of the saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading in short their craft a ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30minute short but as it stands its a 6th form film project realised on a millionpound scale rambling and bloated with its own pretensions that it received funding surely only because of rankins name while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry
