times are tough for angel town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday however due to the presence of an olympic kickboxer olivier worlds lamest actor gruner named jacques hope is on the way angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made and ive seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are french kickboxers who cant act worst of all there are so many awkward moments its just truly hilarious best of all comes from the exchange between gruner and aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is to wit you like the fighting olivier grabs his asian best friend in a headlock i could kill him right when i want him dead he dies the reason why i dont want him dead is because im afraid of him and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me thats why he doesnt die br br of course the fact that its wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation oddbr br however dont let me make this sound that i hated this movie far from it its so terrible its priceless the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees grunner going one on one with gangmembers who the films biggest logic gapdecline the use of pistols also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while gruner kickboxes the rest all of this set to the sound of horrible mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as thisbr br the other treat about this movie is that for some reason olivier gruner never attends college despite thats the main reason hes here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend in a graveyard in the films awkward beginning angel town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you on the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details aint no mercy in angel town br br  out of 4bad
