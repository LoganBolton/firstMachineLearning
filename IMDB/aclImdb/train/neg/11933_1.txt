my kid makes better videos than this i feel ripped off of the 400 spent renting this thing there is no date on the video case apparently designed by wellspring and whats even worse theres no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie the only date given is 2002 leading an unsuspecting renter to believe hes getting a recent filmbr br this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that im amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video it might be of interest to students studying the counterculture of the 1960s the antiwar antiestablishment tunein turnon and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case theres no hint that that is what youre getting if you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors fassbinder and fengler regardless of your state of mind while watching it i can tell you that it doesnt get any better after the first scene so knowing that im sure youll be fast asleep long before the end
