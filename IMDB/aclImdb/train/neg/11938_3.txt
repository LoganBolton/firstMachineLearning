the movie began well enough it had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite getting superpowers telekinesis xray vision invulnerability flight the ability to speak to dogs superspeed heat vision and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly and fighting crime from there on its all downhillbr br meteor man gets a costume from his mom fights with the resident gangs and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing overlong and stupefying endingbr br it wouldnt be so remarkably bad if it werent like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dancebr br despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points it states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then theyll come back to your home and hurt you it states that gangs  communities need to see their real enemies the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence it also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them the only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials rudolph giuliani marion barry ronald reagan george w bush  george hw bush arent crooks toobr br
