well id be lying if i said that this could easily rival spiderman or the batman movies still it was more appealing to me for its moral value i first bought the vhs when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite my wife and i are avid supporters of robert townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie hollywood shuffle true he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still funbr br meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel i always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldnt provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics meteor man is realistic hero with real problems car broken into bad neighborhood local drugdealing gangs using children for distribution etc the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the communitybr br what i found to be truly entertaining outside of james earl jones young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers it wasnt long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families livedbr br yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks 1 with my kids robert townsend works to bring movies home so to speak i doubt hell ever truly be recognized as the talented actorproducerdirector he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his effortsbr br one point to ponder about the film which i find amusing throughout the entire battle with simon no one bothered to call the police also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window my mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toetotoe dad would be loading his pistol lolbr br rent it and check it out its worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of sinbad luther vandross bill cosby big daddy kane etc great job with the cameos robert
