absolutely one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time it starts off badly and just deteriorates katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character the only castmember with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a doubledecker bus through it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen katherine heigls character is completely unsympathetic shes seen as an evil wanton seductress who lures the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife it is implied throughout the movie that shes underage and the message that accompanies that plotstrand just beggars belief at the end she isnt even able to redeem herself by shooting the man whos obviously ha become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere horrible dont waste your time
