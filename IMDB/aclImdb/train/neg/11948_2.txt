horrendous pillaging of a classicbr br it wasnt written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him but he still doesnt help himself at all with his actions inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues lying about the knives etc  this in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely wary of him but this somehow doesnt happen just so they can play the mistakenidentitymurdergame later on which in itself is also ridiculous soandso is the real killer  plus her as well  also him there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didnt need extendingbr br it was good to see perkins reprising his famous role again but thats about the only small pleasure to be had its definitely not a patch on hitchcock and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldnt be bothering at all
