this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent in particular dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here i might have chuckled once or twice during this film but in general its a boring movie with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure the premise although routine still wasnt bad but once the plot was set the film went nowhere dont waste your time with this misfire
