there is nothing cool hip or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean  ugly people are    serial killers if they have to dismember total strangers in order to be a family again then we dont want them to be a family what part of that did you have trouble grasping why applaud this filthbr br this silly filth is what you do if you cant do art ones head  life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting this is a camera without a brain what really makes an artwork cool is profundity questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or in this case a knowledge of anything would be preferable instead this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause its so far out man these same violent events actually happen every day they are not just in the film they refer to actual soulless people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you a child could have thought this up it required zero imagination it is not surrealism this lazy crap has no content is saying nothingits just the worst of the evening news  it is saying nothing new nothing we dont already know its the emperors new clothes the director hoping there are enough uneducated children proud of their streak of inhumanity for this sloppy filth to fly i can see director miikes demented fans now chainsmoking teensand twenties drunks covered in tattoos with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces their knowledgebase inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves br br there is no plot to thisit is just sheer exploitation of shockvalue violence there is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there to do that you need to view  review a real piece of cinema there are plenty out there directed by fellini bergman fassbinder herzog altman bunuel kurosawa lynch tarkovsky peter greenaway tarantino guillermo del toro richard linklater eisenstein aronofsky gus van sant soderbergh shyamalan ordet why dont you view a real art film by the likes of these giants this wannabe director miike will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesnt have the talent anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like visitor q teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon theres no message no meaning no plot nothing to it at all there are long lists of art films to learn frombut this visitor q is not an art film in any respect it has no content to it its just one banal horror piled onto another and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen every single day somewhere in the world they are not okay because they are just in the film they refer to actual soulless people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you to others why because this world is already ugly enough thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this br br there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap there is no deeper meaning there is nothing to analyze why keep trying ive spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made and keeping up with all the new ones but ive never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this its not imaginative or even shocking because these types of events happen daily all over the world to make this film or even to favorably review it has caused over 50 young airheads who dont know any better to think its cool they may grow up thinking that convincing others some of whom may end up doing these thingsconvicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity trust me on thisi know cool and cool this piece of crap aint visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film and im still not sure it isnt actually br br your actions have consequences son the world is awful enough already some violence like this could happen to you or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film believe me you wont be thinking its cool when someone is sawing your skull in half
