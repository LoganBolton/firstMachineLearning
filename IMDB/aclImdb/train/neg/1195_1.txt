this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i cannot express how bad it is i honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end i recommend instead of seeing this movie you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scarsbr br i had such high expectations when i read the back of the dvd case and when in the beginning it added that jesus was following them i was so excited then by the end i wanted to kill myself i mean a twentythree minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema just pain monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash at least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horrorbr br it wasnt that i didnt get the jokes its that they were not only not funny they repeated themselves like twenty times apparently something isnt funny unless you see it like a million timesbr br do not under any circumstances see this people have rated manos the hands of fate as the worlds worst movie i have seen that too and agree that it is bad but alas it is only the second worst fatty drives the bus is by far worsebr br this deserves all kind of harsh language but i cant write that here so just imagine i swore a whole bunch
