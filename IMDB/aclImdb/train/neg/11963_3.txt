i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billys movies but couldnt remember this one and now i know why its so full of clich√©s and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesnt even get to be funny very often hes too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor
