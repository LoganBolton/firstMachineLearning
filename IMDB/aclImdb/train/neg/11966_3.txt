bob clampetts porkys poor fish is a soso cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments set in porkys fish shoppe porkys poor fish occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black n white porky cartoon and one of the bookscometolife merrie melodies that were popular at that time typically of many of the early porky cartoons porky is far from the star appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for unfortunately the audience gets far less than they bargained for as was sometimes the case in the bookscometolife series the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a nonanimated medium laughs are scarce and while the cartoon is just about saved by clampetts energetic direction there is very little at all to recommend porkys poor fish over any of the other belowpar early porky cartoons
