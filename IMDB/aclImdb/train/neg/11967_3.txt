considering the risk of showing samesex relationships before the late 1980s personal best could have done better to play the samesex relationship between hemingway chris cahill and donnelly tory skinner as a more than experimental phase of cahills lifebr br it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the samesex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the 1980 oregon track and field competitionbr br this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploitation of young muriel hemingways body and the samesex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this filmbr br pepper thompson
