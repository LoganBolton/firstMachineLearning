how can a movie with amy posey and raechel have nothing funny in it believe it or not house bunny did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money  this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a cliché from beginning to end clichés can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use cliché after cliché rather than ideas or script it uses the preexisting personas of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding
