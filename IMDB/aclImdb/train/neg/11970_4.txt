for the lt to have chosen this one first the film wasnt horrible it was just hollywood worst case ineedthistohappenorwehavenomovie scenario if willis mission was to save the doctor but she was adamant that her people make it out of the missionary he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her he would not have compromised his package for the refugees thats not how it works but as i pointed out this is hollywood we must have drama this is why we make movies because reality isnt quite so complicated however i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry that said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film its not a waste of time tears of the sun is worth the dvd rental fee check it out on a rainy day and youll be satisfied
