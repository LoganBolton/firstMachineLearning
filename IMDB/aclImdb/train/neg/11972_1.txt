the first ten minutes of just looking really dictates the direction most of this movie takes lenny ryan merriman is a 14 year old boy living in new york in the 50s he has a burning desire to see two people have sex who are the best people he has in mind well his own mom and stepfather of course how pleasant unfortunately for lenny he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncles wifebr br lennys next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex however the wife is quite pregnant and they arent currently sleeping together then lenny makes a new friend him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex the problem isits not done in an innocent charming 1950s sort of way i am no prude by any means but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation blowjobs and anal sex that kind of rawness may work in a movie like kids 1995 but in this film it just seems pervertedbr br gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy a former bra model who becomes the object of lennys carnal desires jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the directors chair as possible for better or worse 1996 was awful and now this what a waste 110
