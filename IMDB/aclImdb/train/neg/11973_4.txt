this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacreunprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesnt matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the storybr br one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i dont care what happens to them br br it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me
