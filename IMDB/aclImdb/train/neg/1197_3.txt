they really cant get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning the problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice presidentbr br trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular but of course she comes out of all that the girls go through drunken rages exotic dancing and other absolute nonsensebr br it really cant get much worse than this awful film
