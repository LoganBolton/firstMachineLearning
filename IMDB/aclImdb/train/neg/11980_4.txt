this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very shortbr br the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a doubledq otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in overtime kerry von erich the ic champ was wasted here and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed remember before that he never lost a matchbr br the second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights pinning the honky tonk man koko b ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna this was a foreshadowing of bret harts singles career as he came back from twoonone and almost survived the match he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was dibiases boring feud with dusty rhodesbr br even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since 87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way aroundbr br one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov tanaka and even the warlord in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers but that just wasnt a surprise tito wasbr br i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the endbr br this show was boring and the matches were too short the undertakers debut was cool but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one
