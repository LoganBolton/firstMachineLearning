marie dressler carries this depressionera drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dresslerpolly moran team youll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film its also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from mgm leonard smiths bare bones cinematography is strictly from the set up the camera and dont move it school frequently to the detriment of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen its like a pan and scan print before such existed or having their heads cut off the film doesnt even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production overall its an unsatisfying mess with dressler frequently overemoting and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart
