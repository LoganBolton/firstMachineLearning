ugh another one of those fooled by the cover dvds i expected some kind of action at least with bears cats  such on the cover i got nothing bad moviebr br i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happenno luckbr br now the reason i gave this a 2 is because of the scenery otherwise it suckedbr br the kid was terrible talking to himself although i suppose they couldnt just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and what a dumbass kicking a porcupine and he wouldnt be pulling those quills out that easily eitherthey stick like fishhooks at least he fought the bear weakly a couple of timesbr br what was up with the flashback thing it made a bad movie even worse i wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorcebr br what else can i say well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something at least that would have been more excitingbr br people dont waste your time on this one
