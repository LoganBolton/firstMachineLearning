ever wanted to eat worms heres a documentary to show you how yeahthe kid eats live worms and thats about the most interesting part of the moviebr br this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring im totally in agreement here the movie just doesnt go anywhereunless youre fond of worm eating this is one movie its almost impossible to write a spoiler forbecause nothing much happensbr br now on the technical side they should have given that kid a haircut whos he trying to look like anywaybozo the clown it was almost comicali almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or somethingbr br and on top of that the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filmingbr br all in all this movie nearly put me to sleep and my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interestingbr br i will admit that the scenery was very impressive and had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hitbr br it did seem safe enough for kids to watch the bear scenes and the oddball eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief skinnydipping scene didnt show anythingbr br i gave this one a very generous 3
