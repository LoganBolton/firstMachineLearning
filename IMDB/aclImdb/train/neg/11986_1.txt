what horrible writing and acting no personality what you cant make a good movie with a single character hmm it was done in castaway with self dialogbr br so this kid goes on a trip to see his father the kid jason takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies midflight so the kid crashes in a lake and survives then he runs around surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescuedbr br during that time he fights a bear twice the first time he fights it off in the lake the second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bears chest reminded me of monty pythons the holy grailbr br also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable resultsbr br gag
