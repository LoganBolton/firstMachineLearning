in my lit class weve just finished the book hatchet and this movie is nothing like the book 1 brian never ate worms in the book 2 he didnt know the pilots name 3 his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see 4 the man the mother is cheating with doesnt have black hair he has blonde br br now for the unrealistic parts of the movie 1 a thirteen year old cant punch his fist through a window in one punch br br and for the acting the kid who played brian was a horrible actor br br however i do believe that the scenery was impressive though i highly doubt the director even read the bookbr br this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet by gary paulsen but if you have then begin a complaint letter to the director
