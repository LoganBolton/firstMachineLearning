i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better instead of what should be a gripping tense story of a boys fight for survival in the wilderness it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear adbr br the film begins with brian jared rushton preparing for a journey by plane to see his father his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a goingaway gift whats wrong with a rubiks cube little knowing how badly he will soon need it once in the air the planes pilot a blinkandyoullmisshim cameo by ned beatty suffers a fatal heart attack leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually unscathed brian must find shelter food and hope for rescuebr br here is where the main problem with the movie begins by the very nature of brians solitude jared has very few lines to speak and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene instead he is shown walking around sitting around and so on with only a minimal sense of danger as a result too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents troubled marriage as the source of tension these scenes merely get in the way and dont particularly add much to the story even worse occasionally jared Â– his face covered with mud  lets out a primal scream or two which conjures up unfortunate parallels to predator speaking of unfortunate we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet but it presumably helped keep him warm at nightbr br another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother both she and the father have very little impact in the movie for instance we are never shown how they react to news of brians disappearance how they might be organizing rescue attempts and so on this is just one source of tension the filmmakers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey
