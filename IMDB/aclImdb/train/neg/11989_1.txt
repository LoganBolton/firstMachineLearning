this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorlycreated character in an illfated movie thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie the films main thrust is how a boys temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mothers extramarital affair unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random survival events including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isnt just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie and what a nightmare it is furthermore despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently explodedbr br all in all a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to much less innocent kids
