amy poehler and rachel dratch are among the funnier women to have been on saturday night live its unfortunate that they along with tina fey and maya rudolph were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketchmaking circa 20022006 the show has ever had still these two women most especially know whats funny and they know how to write a funny moviebr br youll notice in the credits of this movie that dratch and director ryan shiraki wrote the story for spring breakdown but who wrote the actual screenplay consisting of dialogue and all the important fillintheblank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie yep just shiraki just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie and no women apparently wrote the script with him the result is a pretty cliché spring break movie that doesnt so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as mtv does every yearbr br if dratch poehler and even costar parker posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay it would have been far less cliché the premise is original being about three thirtysomething women who were unpopular in high school and apparently college too who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about i say allegedly because you never quite know what fun is to these characters they entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale prowoman anthems like true colors and spend their nights together holding makeyourownpizza parties even though none of them are especially unattractive the outside world appears to treat them like they are theres a scene where a blind student of poehlers played by poehlers real life husband will arnett asks her out on a date only to touch her face and immediately change his mind if poehlers character is supposed to be unattractive they obviously hired the wrong actressbr br the movie continues to show promise even though we have our doubts about the main characters when poseys boss texas senator kay bee hartmann jane lynch funny as always hires posey to watch over her unpopular collegeage daughter amber tamblyn playing yet another woman whos attractive in real life but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie while she goes to a laguna beachlike vacation spot for spring break poehler and dratch come along they reluctantly get boozed up party like they apparently should have when they were in college and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by sophie monkbr br sophie monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons unfortunately her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny date movie 2006 and the disappointing click 2006 here she plays a southern belle although her voice sounds like she stole delta burkes voice box she hams it up a little too much trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extrasbr br spring breakdown was released straight to dvd despite the star power of amy poehler but rightly so because the story is way too cliché it may as well have been called national lampoons spring breakdown and the magazine probably wouldnt have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity if director shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input especially rachel dratch this movie would have been great and not nearly as runofthemill as frathouse comedies weve seen before i know dratch will come up with another funny concept and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself shes funny enough and she deserves better than this halfbaked comedy that would accept stifflers brother with open arms
