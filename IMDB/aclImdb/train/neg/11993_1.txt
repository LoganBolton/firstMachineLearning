after seeing only half of the film in school back in november today i saw that it was on flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on itbr br the book that the film is based on hatchet is ok this is a terrible adaption of it thoughbr br awful and i mean awful acting bad dialogue and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of hatchetbr br the film starts off brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen sporting a mullet banging his head to cheap 80s rock music and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged dad his parents are divorcednow cue the dramatic pause now brian has said goodbye to mom and dog and is flying up to see his father the pilot is a fat ugly rude man wasnt like that in the book who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies in the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attackbr br the plane within another two minutes has gone empty on fuel leaving us the viewers to assume that hes been up there for hours even though the sun hasnt changed position and the scenery looks exactly the same nows hes crashed landedbr br this is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book in the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips looks like he just bought it it never said he climbed a mountain saw a wolf and fell asleep up there on the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear it said a moose but not a bear it never said he eats the several bugs that he does it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows skin them and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoesbr br i dont even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado all it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his thingsbr br my favorite part of this camp fest was brians lame flashbacks that are never mentioned in the book especially the cliché scene of brian waking up walking over to the window and seeing his dad with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck leaving and screams daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddd yet of course his father didnt hear him even though he was just right outside and he punches his fist through the window wtf br br the ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book i said close in the book i think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to brian when he landed was youre the kid who theyve been looking for they stopped months ago yet they left that line out in the moviebr br theres a pathetic epilogue with brian somehow without counseling or therapy getting back to normal with his family i think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for thanksgiving because they had a turkey on the counter then it shows his temporary home for what in the movie seemed like three days but in the book was for several months and his hatchet still in a tree where he left it also didnt happen in the book showing where he carved a message so perfectly done home where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet br br no quote can sum this movie up better then when enid from ghost world said this is so bad its gone past good and back to bad again perfect description of this moviebr br i wouldnt recommend it to somebody who hasnt read the book and are just looking to watch a movie nor would i to somebody who has read the book because theyll be disappointed and bored to deathbr br for those who have read the book leave what your imagination created as the movie this is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the bookbr br 110
