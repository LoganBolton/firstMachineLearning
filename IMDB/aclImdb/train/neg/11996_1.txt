i have been waiting for this movie a long time especially because juhi chawla is in this shes a great actressbr br this movie contains six stories its a new concept flew over from hollywood so its not a new itembr br 1 khamini priyanka chopra is a dancer she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her but then rahul salman khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriendbr br priyanka chopra is still not a good actress when she yells i get annoyed salman khan cannot play comic roles but in his serious parts he is marvelousbr br 2 vinay anil kapoor is married to seema juhi chawla he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman with forgetting what he really has in life his wife and kidsbr br anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors  actresses they are great but this story is to thin for thembr br 3 shiven akshaye khanna is going to get married to gia ayesha takia but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding offbr br 4 ashutosh joh abraham is married to tehzeeb vidya balan she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss now she doesnt know that she loves her husband anymorebr br 5 raju govinda is a cab driver he meets stephani shannon esrechowitz who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman raju has to bring staphani to that man but falls in love with herbr br i never liked govindas movies he is very annoying not funny but in this movie i liked him very much like he has been growing up the last yearsbr br 6 oh yes there is sohail khan he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati isha koppikar he want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in betweenbr br sohail khan is not a handsome actor but he is funny i like his moviesbr br now heres the problem all these stories arent interesting to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting here and there the stories touch each other but is not significant for the charactersbr br my conclusion priyanka cannot act loose that woman in the bollywood industry sohail khan should make more movies this role for him was too small salman khan cannot act comic roles but real serious movies thats written on his life as an actor this movie sucks and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor juhi chawla akshaya khanna and john abrahambr br its just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan and you only let him sing a lullaby
