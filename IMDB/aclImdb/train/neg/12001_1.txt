my sincere advice to all dont watch the moviebr br dont even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes its 330 am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survivalbr br i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish moviebr br happy republic day to one and all
