clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes salaameishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from india that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love which is at least four tales too many in my estimationbr br filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls highstepping songanddance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and wayoverthetop comical performances  all pretty much standardissue stuff when it comes to bollywood happenings these days its an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storylinebr br theres plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here  not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women  but hell need the patience of job to get him all the way through it
