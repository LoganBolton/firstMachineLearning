i had a video of the thing and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep its slowmoving and the idea of a midatlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony apart from conrad veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting when the water started to spill bigtime it even on one occasion woke me upbr br but give the man his due no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt he doesnt wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals he holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearlybrowns there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark backgroundand looks very artistically done but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke
