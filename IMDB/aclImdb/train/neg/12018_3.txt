 a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesnt care who he has to kill to get it the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his lifebr br  if this sounds ridiculous it is the whole idea that this izodwearing dune buggydriving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly his friend may be good with a gun but hes up against a group of trained killers the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob theres also a subplot about how the friends father was killed years ago by the mob boss but theres little made of it and it doesnt help the movie any at allbr br  the mob boss mister scarface is played by jack palance i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheckbr br  ive seen some pretty good italian crimecop flicks recently but mister scarface isnt one of them check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead
