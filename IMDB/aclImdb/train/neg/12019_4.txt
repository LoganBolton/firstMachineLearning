i read a couple of good reviews on this board for mr scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of ricks al cliver character the whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of vinchenzo napoli vittorio caprioli but as most other viewers commented hes about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence i found it somewhat unbelievable that manzaris goons who chased tony through the streets didnt actually stroke out before tony even laid a hand on them for all of his buildup as the title character jack palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the us working title mr scarface rather moot ive seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they dont all work i guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didnt quite make it either
