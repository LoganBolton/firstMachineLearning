the story idea is excellent unfortunately the execution lets it downbr br the movie lacks pace for one thing it should be an exciting ride but it is slow and more than a little boringbr br i think the problems mainly in the screenplay and editing there arent enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense and there are scenes which dont really move the story along very effectivelybr br the producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite unfortunately when the producer is also the writer and the director this evidently aint gonna happenbr br much of the acting seems kind of flat and that is down to the director  all the actors have been quite competent in other projectsbr br its a shame because with better writing editing and direction this could have been a really good thriller
