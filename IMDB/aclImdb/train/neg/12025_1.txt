this movie was on the romance channel and i thought it might be a goofy 80s movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and i watched it boy did it suck boy gets crush on girlcorrection his dreamgirl apparently there is a difference and im surprised he realized she was his dream girlhe was smitten with her from over 30 feet away i guess that just goes to show the power of dreamgirls boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dreamgirl creative in the sense that its a farout plan but uncreative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternooneither the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their dayjobs to come to the set i suspect the latter very clumsily done very pathetic its almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it unless youre interested in seeing chad lowes early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hivpositive gay guy on the series life goes on or gail ogrady who was on nypd blue and probably got to stare at dennis franzs buttocks but those are unlikely motivesid say systematic derangement of the senses would be a more justified purpose im surprised i watched it all i guess its the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid selfflagellistic innerissue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the offchance that itll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health can you take the challenge
