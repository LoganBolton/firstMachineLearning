i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivelbr br oth there is something fascinating about watching something so jawdroppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad
