generally ive found that if you dont hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd theres probably a good reason for it i hadnt heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones i wanted to see anyway i figured id give this one a shotbr br its really not much different than other movies in the genre such as the singles ward or the rm if youre into those type movies youll probably enjoy thisbr br however if youre not a mormon this movie probably wont appeal to you theres no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy ultimately if you dont fall within the mormon demographic youre probably better off watching something elsebr br admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but i didnt think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
