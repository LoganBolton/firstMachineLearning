baptists at our barbecue is the best film ever made now that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken let me begin my short overview of this tacky offensive pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie first of all the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by f mathew smith i really despise the fact that it sends a very promormon and sort of antievery other religion message yes the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists it shows all the main and rolemodel characters being mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very judgmental baptists it shows how beautiful mormons are and how coldhearted and ignorant baptists are instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic im a part of neither religion im actually an atheist but this offended me along with another countless amount of baptists most likely it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons and the mormons being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual likedislike between them sorry i didnt mean to go off on a rantbr br another aspect of baptists at our barbecue i didnt much care for was the acting the performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead heather beers miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and i wasnt too much impressed with dan merkley whos the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but i have to say hes way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers whoever played the town sheriff was awful also although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clichés for example the main character tartan merkley finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life  how cliché is that to make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché tartan buys the poor lonely heathen a puppy dog ugghhh br br if you want my advice stay as far away from baptists at our barbecue as you can i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion all i got was a well piece of crap grade dbr br my ratings guide  a absolutley flawless a a masterpiece nearperfect a excellent b great b very good b good c a mixed bag c average c disappointing d bad d very bad d absolutley horrendous f not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces
