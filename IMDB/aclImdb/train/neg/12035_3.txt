i expected this to be a lot better i love tim burtons work so i was really excited to see these online short films well they werent at all what i had expectedbr br i dont really know what exactly it is i dont like i guess theyre just sort of dull the sound bothers me and most of the characters although i loved roy the toxic boy and stainboybr br the match girl episode probably bugged me the most although it was pretty funnybr br i also dont like the way some of the characters die like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the girl who stares died in general roys death was amusing surprisingly death by a car freshener very original  that made me laugh so hardbr br there are some things that arent appropriate for kids just some language and gore thats about all i have to say 310
