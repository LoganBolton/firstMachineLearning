this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood its amazing looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience it might as well have been called new adventures of mr bland actingbr br someone commented before me that if you had imagination youd love this show that is a horrible approach to a tvseries a visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldnt have to force your imagination into something to make it good that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever if a movie is boring i just make up my own storybr br in conclusion absolute human waste
