as was to be expected a mazursky film made in the 70s would be counterculture sympathetic towards the hippies  and have a lot of hippies in it  and naturally it is childishly antiauthoritarian eg the scene on the mexican border when sutherland provokes a customs officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he sutherland has long hair the constant leftwing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians needless to say he would be welcomed with open arms in todays hollywood one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills  a racewar sotospeak in the middle of la this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies fortunately some of sutherlands hippie friends make fun of this blackrevolution premise and the resulting dialogue isnt bad a little later the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem when the latter starts talking about masturbation another funny moment is when sutherlands older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white schoolmates and they all say we the black people of the republic of south africabr br there is always a certain amount of selfindulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood  especially when its hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies now thats very very selfindulgent indeed the scene with fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying though mazursky throws in the standard flowerchildren and antivietnam bullshit into the soup and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood but he wasis just as much a part of the phony hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else i am pretty sure that he too makes phony smalltalk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesnt know or like but whose money he wants badly for his next leftwing project as for his hair he has the worst hair ive seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere its sort of like the kind of long hair that a middleaged accountant would have if he grew it long the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third if youd like to read my parodybiography of donald sutherland and other hollywood actors contact me by email
