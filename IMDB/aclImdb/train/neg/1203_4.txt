the concept of this madefortv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late 1970s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog the plot of devil dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of the omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of german shepard pups seriously im not kidding thats what the movie is about during the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by satan himself youd think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to fornicate with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not exactly like little damien in the omen one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal but lucky  thats the dogs name  is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways he also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father richard crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because hes a chosen one the whole thing becomes too moronic for words when crenna eventually travels to ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect english i guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life director curtis harrington whats the matter with helen ruby and lead actor richard crenna wait until dark the evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that the special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the satandog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall devil dog is a truly dumb movie but its definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor there are entertaining brief cameos of martine beswick dr jekyll and sister hyde as the terrifying cult queen and rg armstrong the car the pack as the evil fruit vegetable and puppy salesman and yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her icecream in carpenters assault on precinct 13
