i know nothing of the iliad so can not comment on its accuracy to that story however as a stand alone film i found this very boring the battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious cgibr br the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the ladies but he does not make a good warrior too pretty i am afraidbr br good points are is the design this film does look good with the landscape and castle buildingswalls impressive i do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely we hear american scottish english anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisationbr br all in all i do not recommend this film for a family sit down it is too long and the young will get boredbr br for adults it is ok if you dont care about the lack realism
