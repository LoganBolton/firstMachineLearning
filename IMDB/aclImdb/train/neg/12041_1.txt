well were to start this is by far one of the worst films ive ever paid good money to see i wont comment on the story itself its a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera to start with the acting except for eric bana is soap opera quality ive always been a fan of brad pitt but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame the camera action doesnt help either how it lingers on him when hes thinking it just takes me back to brooke forresters days in the lab peter otoole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one either way he looks more like linda evans than linda evans and to end my comments diane kruger is a cute girl but she sure is no helen of troy peterson should rather have chosen saffron burrows for the role since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now
