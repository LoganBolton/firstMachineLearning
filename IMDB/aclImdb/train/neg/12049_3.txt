the box for to die for suckered me in  a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex there was plenty of thomas arklie simon whos easy on the eyes but no laughs and little sexinessbr br the couple mark and simon have allegedly been together several years but neither character is interesting enough to care about so its hard to imagine that they care about each other the fault seems to lie in the script not the performances both actors do the best they can with what theyre given br br the ending is sappy and unaffecting well not totally unaffecting i felt relief that it was over br br if youre looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids thats funny parting glances is far better
