i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day its not that bad for a madefortv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and businesslike for lack of a better word it wont blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but its not a waste of time either its the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you arent in the mood to think too hardbr br however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you wont be disappointed the early scenes with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously nonthreatening and the climactic bluescreen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty sidesplitting and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginningbr br not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv
