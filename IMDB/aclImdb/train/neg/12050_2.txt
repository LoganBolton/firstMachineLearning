i had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was positioned as some cross between an aidsrelated story and some kind of ghostblithe spirit tale this film cant always make its mind up what it wants to be br br simon and mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship  simon is able to have anonymous though safe sex on the side when he wants mark is hiv and he and simon dont seem to have a sex life anymore when mark dies simon  who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father  tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor not that his behavior before marks death was much different but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelingsbr br unfortunately simon is such a selfish sob its impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic its too late to care mark on the other hand follows in demi moores footsteps from ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie br br there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the tv show bewitched but that doesnt last long once simons emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings the finale with a goldplated muscleboy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened griefstricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isnt intentionally funny
