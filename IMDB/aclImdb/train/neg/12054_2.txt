what happens when you give a homeless man 100000 as if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen the creators of reversal of fortune try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experimentbr br they take ted a homeless man in pasadena and give him 100000 to see if he will turn his life around then with only the most cursory guidance and counseling they let him go on his merry waybr br what are they trying to say money cant buy you happiness the homeless are homeless because they deserve to be or how about lift a man up  its more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude they took a man with nothing to lose gave him something to lose and then watched him dump it all down the drain thats supposed to be entertainment they dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos  only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked what happens when you take down a stop sign
