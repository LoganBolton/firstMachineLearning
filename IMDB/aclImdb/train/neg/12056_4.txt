this film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny tv sitcom in puerto rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film almost silencing all others coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners the weekly claridad is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the films form and content and pointed out all its flaws clich√©s and bad writingbr br just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes and because one can recognize actors and scenery does not make it an acceptable film
