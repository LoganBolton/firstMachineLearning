the 80s were not very kind to onetime major star charles bronson starting with 1982s death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from 89 bronsons screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness dw ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronsons characters daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge im not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizenaged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generatedbr br kinjite  the last of these films  is fairly wellmade but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things ive thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gangrape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was offscreen though wellimpliedbr br what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the 60s and 70s like the mechanic death wish from noon til 3 once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc
