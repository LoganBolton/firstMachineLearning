the husbandandwife team of bennie fields and blossom seeley were huge stars in vaudeville yet they made very few films as is the case for some other performers of their era george m cohan fanny brice gertrude lawrence the most accessible piece of film footage for fields and seeley is the biopic about them in which theyre portrayed by other actors somebody loves me starring betty hutton and that inimitable songanddance man ralph meekerbr br in their heyday fields and seeley were so hugely popular that another husbandandwife vaudeville act  jesse block and eve sully  achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act effectively becoming the secondteam fields and seeley offstage though there was a major difference in the couples living arrangements fields and seeley lived in hotel suites paying roomservice rates for every meal they ate and eventually running out of money block and sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely ending in comfortable retirementbr br the first 30 seconds of this vitaphone short are occupied by two spatswearing pianists apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 although ive never heard of them finally fields and seely rush in and start performing they both have plenty of pep and shes fairly attractivebr br i was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if theyre about to break into a dance but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short when they finally start hoofing the results are not impressivebr br i was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act now that ive seen it i understand why they never became stars in movie musicals my rating for this one just 4 out of 10 and ill stick with block and sully
