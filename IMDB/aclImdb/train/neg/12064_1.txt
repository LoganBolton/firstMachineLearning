this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as its absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time all the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus i could see the two twists at the end coming miles away the great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasnt so damn boring and there isnt one character to root for either plus i hope it makes its way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion when john carradine finally shows up at the end its a pretty good scene but its already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by bees as it was rather gory i got this in a dvd horror set called back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus its lucky this was included in a set i bought otherwise i would have chucked this out the window this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as its absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time and i say avoid it like the plague you dont want to go through the torture the direction is absolutely terrible carl monson does an absolutely terrible job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is just as bad john carradine is good in his scene but other then that hes hardly in the film other then flashback scenes carradine ruled merry anders overacts here terribly as laura as she didnt convince me at all ivy bethune is ok and somewhat creepy but also overacted she did have a creepy smile at the end though rest of the cast i didnt pay enough attention too as i had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad overall please avoid thisits not worth the agony bomb out of 5
