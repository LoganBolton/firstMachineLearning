this thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web so i bought me a copy well of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments i think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it it was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget but for me he surely didnt spoiled the money on props but on the make up the make up is for that kind of flick well done the zombies are watchable and the gore is intact the only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule its terrible luckely no hiss on the sound but sometimes its way too dark so you have to watch clearly to see the gore in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish a voiceover tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes that tells you there is gore on the way of course that doesnt work made me think of cannibal girls had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow they had the original idea cannibal girls was made a year earlier dont go for the storyline go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake when the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back ontry to do that or am i getting a bit offlineeat it you ugly corpses
