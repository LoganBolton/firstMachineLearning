i happen to have bought one of those legacy of horror 50 movie pack collections and would you believe im still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devils messenger or the devil bat or one of the great alfred hitchcocks films some arent horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they cant accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matterbr br so we open up to sort of a westing game idea the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine the one standing feature of this has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates carradine gives a good enough performance as always but hes left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocreterrible performances the rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes given this was an independent film of the 70s the lighting and effects are pretty limited its hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer cant see whats happening that well in some scenes some actors like the servants igor and elga give an effort at least and im ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious whodoneit but not enough to enhance the quality of the film you arent meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there it proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack chilling containing films like house on a haunted hill little shop of horrors with jack nicholson and night of the living dead over it this is best avoided
