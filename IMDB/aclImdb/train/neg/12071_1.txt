terriblejust terrible probably the worst film i have ever seen and i did see some pretty bad pictures throughout the years the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture the direction the actingetc etc the only good shoots meaning funny because theyre so bad  are the special effects overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs the rest of the flick gives you brain damage
