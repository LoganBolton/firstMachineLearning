ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man john carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally one conditionthey must spend one week in his estate to get the money and if any of them die the others get more guess what happens next br br i saw a brand new print of this film on cable the colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful thats about all the good things i can say about itbr br lets list just some of the problems this film has the killer is screamingly obvious the servants are called igor and elgacome on some of the sound recording was so bad i couldnt make out the dialogue no great loss im sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable actingso bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief even pro jeff morrow was terrible the only fairly good acting was from trouper faith domergue who deserved better than this and john carradine who looks painfully old and frail here i do have to admit thoughthe closing line in this movie is a gembr br why this was renamed legacy of blood is beyond metheres another 1978 horror film with that namebr br whatever its name is its a bad movie to be avoided at all costs
