you all know the story of hamlet i do br br  well the to be or not to be phrase not the speech itself has been beaten into the ground so many times that its not very interesting in fact it wasnt that great to begin with in fact i find hamlet a good but vastly overrated play its not even shakespeares best julius caesar and romeo  juliet are ten times better with a midsummer nights dream and othello not too far behind macbeth knock your table off his drawers puck will make amends ow isnt that bad either there are lots of others that are better than this by shakespearebr br  i wont really comment too much on the movie rather i will dissect the utterly horrible mst3k episodebr br  okay    mike and the bots win a card game get to pick the movie    they ask for hamlet pearl sends them this yadda yadda yadda    and prepare for the most boring scifi episode of mst3k ever admittedly i havent seen any of the cc onesbr br  while blood waters of dr z makes the viewing of that episode horrible since it is not really a movie rather random splicedtogether scenes im reminded of mikes line from future war maybe this is an anthology of short plotless movies the sol crew a lot got off a good many good cracks cant say the same for herebr br  the riffs fall flat the host segments par usual are at best mediocre and when the movie itself which isnt that bad is actually better i mean as a quality movie not as camp like prince of space than the mst3k version of it you know the show must be bad i laughed the last time i saw it was several months ago oh maybe eight or nine times throughout i tried and tried and tried to be entertained  but i just couldnt only the occasional line like hail queen dilberts boss and when thats the funniest line of the episode well ahem  and by occasional i mean every ten minutes or so  maybe me even chuckle the second time i tried to watch it i didnt even laugh at the few jokes id found funny before and simply gave up forty minutes beforebr br  the movie isnt horrible its just a german version of hamlet the actors are good enough and though the dubbing isnt the greatest thats not in itself a reason to hate this film br br  four stars for hamlet three yes three for the mst3k versionbr br  ps why why why mst3k
