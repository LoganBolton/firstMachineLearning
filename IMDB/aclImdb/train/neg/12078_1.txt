i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie granted its shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based storybr br the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during characters interacting its nearly difficult to distinguish whos lines are whos granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they couldve obtained voice actors which couldve added a bit more drama to these classic literary linesbr br it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 although perhaps thats based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still its absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 110
