alas poor hamlet i knew him dear reader and let me tell thee this version sucks i dont know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam but i hope that theyre proud of themselves they took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable this version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a great thespian like maximilian schell in the title role can save it this movies only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for mst3k mike servo and crow had a lot of fun with this onebr br but either way im sure that shakespeare had he been alive when they made this would not have wanted his name associated with it this hamlet is not even so bad thats it good its just plain bad absolutely dreadful
