yay i think its hard to say its hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as sterile as a surgeons scalpel for a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature the dubbing really wasnt all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary lifesucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being mst 3kbr br not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
