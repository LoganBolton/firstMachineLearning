takebr br 1 a famous playbr br 2 a director with now ideas of his own who is usingbr br 3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1br br 4 an actor for the lead  who has no feeling for the part hes playing and youll get hamlet prinz von d√§nemarkbr br i listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what hes saying  nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyones taste but usually i like it when theres just enough on the stage to make clear whats the setting and nothing more alas thats on a stage in a theatre it wont work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already lets say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if youve got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet dont watch this one unless youre a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors
