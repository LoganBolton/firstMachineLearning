theres really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis i mean its shakespeares hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written im not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have  through mystery science theater 3000 while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips in a word this german madefortv version of hamlet is dreary 152 minutes no way its too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on ive said it any number of times but entertainment is the thing for me and this wristslitter is far from entertaining i will however give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting a 310 sounds about right to mebr br as much as i enjoy mst3k their comments dont help to make hamlet any more palatable there are a few good riffs here and there but overall hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst3k shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow as much as it pains me ive got to give hamlet a 15 on my mst3k rating scale
