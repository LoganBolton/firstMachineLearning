i wasnt really hoping for much when i went to see this after mst3king the heck out of jasonx with some friends though i was hoping for a similar experience herebr br unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously do i care about jasons problems im sorry no there are a legion ft13th movies that cover that anyway at at then end of the day hes an undead serial killer im just not going to get that sympatheticbr br freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatchonly not funnybr br
