i rented this shortly after renting ben steins expelled and thought it would interesting to compare them before i go further it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if im prejudiced or not im trying to be objective for the recordbr br i tend to enjoy mahers hbo show now and then though i rarely think hes the source of the humor i dont really care for his standup either but he makes some good points on the show now and again and i liked politically incorrect though he was still fairly politically correct which i deem a negative because the very term sounds orwellian or at least fascist as for my religious views ill say for simplicitys sake that im a nondenom christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed inbr br that being said this a bad documentary for reasons that havent been touched on yet by many reviewersthough the ones mentioned are valid too the reason its not convincing isnt just that he argues the main point without letting others talk and his point boils down to nothing logical either its just come on really which isnt a point just a question try david hume if you want a decent argument the reason this isnt convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasnt a clergyman there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with masters or doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring particularly in the fields of history anthropology or a host of othersbr br if one compares this to ben steins expelled no intelligence allowed hell find that stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors professionals clergy etc he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this instead he idiotically refers to the 20th centurys secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more sociopolitical power its in the bonus features where hes standing in front of the anne frank house i think this is a true orwellian headtrip he blames christianity in particular on many pointless deathswhich has had its share though far smaller than mostwithout even including a basic view of the evidence perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanisms miserable record of the 20th century alonebr br another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or average practitioner he picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd how difficult is that how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule it does not wow so people in cults think outside of the norm how enlightening to know this great work maher again it would be fairly easy to interview someone like laurence vance and include his work on refuting the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved inbr br beyond all that hes just not that funny here some of the clips that are overlaid in clever out of contextirreverent ways might garner a laugh but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from maher will not be forthcoming much less convincing he spends most of his time bashing christians spouting inaccuracies and interviewing fringe groups that he doesnt allow to really answer his questionsbr br for the record there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves he touches on almost none of these i get the feeling that i couldve responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed but the whole thing reeks of deckstacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out
