ive been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting of course i am catholic come from a welleducated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bills opinionsbr br bills problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative hes correct to document the sociological aspects of it ie one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god but that said he never looks at its positive side quite frankly i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor shes dead now of course but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit uscs institute for advanced catholic studies which has brought together some of the worlds finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the worlds poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the worlds people who live on less than 1 a day of course he wont do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and its so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokesbr br that fits into the other large problem with bills movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is in this movie you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ and with an actor playing jesus at a holy land theme parkbr br what you wont see in bills film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a phd in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame byu or wheaton college who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter you wont see any serious discussion of any of the writings of cs lewis gk chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also wont find any discussion whatsoever of any of the nonabrahamic judaism christianity and islam faiths whatsoever all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gutlevel understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind itbr br i get a lot of what bills saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies
