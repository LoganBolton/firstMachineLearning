now dont get me wrong if you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture if you need a healthy dose of all the solid sound reasons why religion has outlived its usefulness then turn to sagan or dawkins not bill maher for gods sake thats a good point in and of itself maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society art and science is rooted in itbr br in this film he relies heavily on his keenlyhoned skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise unfortunately his intellect isnt up to the taskbr br maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box as an example he responds to an interviewees and i use the term loosely as they were clearly all ambushees assertion that the existence of jesus is historical fact with a deadpan no its not followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subjects naivety a device nauseatingly overused in this film the problem is that the person was correct and maher dead wrong in his assertion that jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels i guess mr maher has never read the contemporary historian josephusbr br but the masses will flock to this pseudodocumentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like michael moore and they will loudly bray and guffaw they certainly did at my showingbr br its doubly telling however that the loudest and most mulelike braying occurred during the approximately 70 of the running time that the film devoted to its antichristian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 devoted to criticizing the selfdescribed religion of peace hmmm either criticism of islam is offlimits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh very telling either way
