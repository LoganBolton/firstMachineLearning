i saw it i agree with him 100 but i didnt care for his delivery he just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign edit cuts galore etc the camera would be focused on him and youd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film nonobr br this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags to make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselvesbr br i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or  he could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon founder who had quite the colorful past delve into science vs religion one is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims it is so because well i said sobr br done right id say turn it into an hbo original series hit a different religion every weekbr br it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good ole gwbush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blindbr br bill moyer well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at sutra in newport beach
