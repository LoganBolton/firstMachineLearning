this film is really only bill mahers interpretation of religion there are several funny moments and some interesting points but dont go into this expecting an evenhanded discussion of religion this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary  everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decisionbr br editing  its very chopped up interspliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher they get editedbr br interviewees  they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype to a truck stop chapel seriously a truck stop chapel hes picked the worst moneygrabbers the heavy extremists and those who dont have the budget to say no to pick on and when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of thembr br stereotyping  all religions are portrayed as stereotypes especially hard hit are the muslims during the muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers all muslims are portrayed as guntoting extremists through the editing and none of the people interviewed is edited fairlybr br ending  the message at the end is incredibly heavyhanded and while it is an interesting idea its not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupidbr br with the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny but know going in it is a very onesided view bill mahers view of religion hes not discovering anything hes telling you what he thinksbr br 410  some good moments but heavyhanded with an extremely irresponsible documentary style
