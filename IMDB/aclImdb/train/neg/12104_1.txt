bill mahers religulous is not an attack on organized religion its an attack on christianity and islam apart from ridiculing a bunch of rabbis inventing warped machines to get around sabbath regulations he really doesnt attack judaism and seems enraged when a rabbi actually challenges the existence of the state of israel if bill maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion he would realize that the very creation of israel in the palestinian territories is based on the so called holy books of organized religion this is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this filmbr br i find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks theyre stupid what makes him the rational person in the room in a way it reflects how he really isnt and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those peoplebr br if you want to watch a good moviedocumentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization watch richard dawkins root of all evil it is a brilliantly researched documentary clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and howbr br bill mahers religulous is not funny poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic it seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his catholic upbringing i almost feel sorry for him
