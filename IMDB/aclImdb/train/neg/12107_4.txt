like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies if you asked me to name a good gangster movie id have dozens to choose from if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you the last time that film is the general unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name this is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story its more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavorbr br like goodfellas 1990 and american gangster 2007two superior mob moviesthe general is based on real people and true events the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill brendan gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult meanwhile the police led by an inspector named kenny jon voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill himbr br perhaps because its a film in the same category as the marvelous goodfellas 1990 and the first two godfather films i was expecting too much from the general but that may be going too easy on it this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its fartoostretched running time of screaming bad scenes lets start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented for some reason director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in blackandwhite while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a fullfledged color film now i have nothing against bw pictures not even ones made in modernday times schindlers list 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in blackandwhite and its a masterpiece the general made just five years after schindlers list is not the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very videogamelike quality that i found simply annoying the filmmakers were obviously going for a realists documentarylike style like schindlers list did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classicstyle motion picture performances in the film range from passable to poor brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting the sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crimenoir appeal but that also fails because again its made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of placebr br but the worst thing that occurs is that theres not onenot onecharacter in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for in fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was okayso what moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and timeconsuming here i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did if a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing no remorse no relief no surprise nothing we just say so what and thats all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorlymade crime film
