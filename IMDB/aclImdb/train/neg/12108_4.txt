just had to write that one liner but it really is i love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry ive seen in recent years  i have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one the script  it is a weak story about a petty criminal no amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance i love kevin spacey and i hear hes gonna do another film about the general my advice is dont waste your time
