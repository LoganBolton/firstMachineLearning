john boormans 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback though its hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in bw scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a m√©nage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesnt get it instead its lumbered with what may well be brendan gleesons worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but theres nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but its at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his anticsbr br theres a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the general and his men painting them as antisocial drug dealers purely because cahill wont share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot  something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which were expected to find lovably cheeky  that its just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then its too late to really care adrian dunbar maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but jon voights hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance overcompensating for gleesons comatose noninvolvement in what feels like a total misfire come back zardoz all is forgiven
