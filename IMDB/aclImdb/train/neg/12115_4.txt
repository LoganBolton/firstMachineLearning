ive been working my way through a collection of lugosi films recently and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of lugosi and boris karloff in the black cat i was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in the raven alas it just didnt work for me and by the end of the film i was quite disappointedbr br for the first three quarters of this movie or so i thought the story lacked any real suspense lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad dr vollins some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman irene ware he treats after a car accident but who cant have her  partly because shes already engaged and partly because her father samuel s hinds disapproves to deal with that situation he enlists the aid of edmond bateman boris karloff  a horribly ugly man who wants vollins to make him look more acceptable aside from lugosis performance though i found little to hold my interest then suddenly in the last fifteen or twenty minutes the movie shifts around completely suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful but i thought lugosis performance fell apart largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane  and theres a difference he plays the mad role very well  controlled and in control but evil insane is a more out of control evil and i didnt think lugosi pulled that off well at one point he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake in the meantime karloff was a huge disappointment he never grabbed me at all as an aside it must have grated on lugosi that  in movies in which they costar  karloff gets the top billing even though in the raven its clearly lugosi who is the lead actor this surely gives a hint as to how universal ranked their two great horror stars  inexplicably i would add because ive always thought of lugosi as the better actor of the twobr br in any event theres no real connection here to edgar allen poes story the raven  except that vollins is a poe fanatic who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from poes stories overall a disappointment 410
