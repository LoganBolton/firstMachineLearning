you may say to yourself don johnson as elvis can that work is it possible seems like an terrible choice to me but perhaps i should have an open mind maybe ill be surprised maybe he can pull it offbr br notbr br don johnson is not a bad actor but he is an awful elvis hes too short too weakvoiced too sharply featured  well youve already imagined how bad he would be add to that a hokey black wig and heavyhanded eyeliner and mascara and its a big fat embarrassing messbr br the best i can say is that since johnsons acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off after a while you dont even think of him as elvis anymore you see him as some other crazed pop star instead then on that level the movie becomes watchablebr br stephanie zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall beauty queen linda thompson but she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty elegance and intelligence weve come to expect from all her roles there may be too much intelligence in her performance you have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dopebr br theres nothing new to this story weve heard it many times before if youve looking for new info or insight you wont find it its told as a love story  an unrequited one linda for elvis and elvis for drugs
