seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with ronnie osullivan defeating greame dott by 18 frames to 8 bbc 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge offbr br i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm  certainly the opening with the mawkish pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the brightly lit  too brightly lit  cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasnt until the appearence of viggo mortensen as hippy guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release  after all someone of mortensens stature wouldnt star in a tvm  i mean thats like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film  wait a minute  didnt bob  br br some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing onscreen couple and i agree  i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl  the sixties was before my time but surely if youve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives its not really a choice at all  mind you a lot of people took lsd in those days so i guess that explains itbr br i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact its a romantic drama at heart  just like youd expect in a tvm  with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene  it jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969  i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and woodstock  in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
