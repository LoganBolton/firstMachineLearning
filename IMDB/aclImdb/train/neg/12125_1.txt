why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moonlanding with the titanic sinking and youve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by lowlife trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do ill show those old meanies ill put out my own movie and prove that you dont have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane im running the other way its child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids its audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969
