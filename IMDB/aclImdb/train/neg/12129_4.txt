prior to this film i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore 1981 famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from manchild peter bark and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didnt hurt massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare fleshbr br the story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot is confusing and ohso boring when the blood isnt flowing and the skin isnt on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of notebr br the only point of interest about the film is that its producer lucio fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his megagory movie cat in the brain aka nightmare concert and if youve already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with massacre
