by dane youssefbr br a gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong theyre in trouble the police are outside theyre cornered what are they gonna do nowbr br sound familiarbr br the movie seems like its trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theaterbr br its the kind of things that actors loveits kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planninggiving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all upbr br a trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works to top things off theres a bit of a fenderbender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshieldbr br the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dinos last chancebr br spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge he pans over to a bright passionred cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart and he keeps all the violence offscreen reallybr br i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edgebr br the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gangbr br gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tagalong with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foulswearing maddog police lieutenant whos all thumbs but he isnt given anything to really do herebr br william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill bloodbr br and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of thisbr br spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and theyre to calm and too articulate theres even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh botherbr br these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldnt the holedup crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening insidebr br someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation offscreen and theres one more casualty that happens thats well kinda sad butbr br faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her new orleans accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller partbr br a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield br br the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and its as profane but never as realistic or as insightfulbr br the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really lowbudget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script thats not bad but needs a few more rewrites spacey shows hes not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like hes just filming actors actbr br these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from miscasting br br i dont mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles wouldve helped immenselybr br having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb that would have been a big improvementbr br when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors actingbr br sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for itbr br hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like comingofage stories so its only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as wellbr br there are a few really great entries into this genre spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the negotiatorbr br this certainly wont become a cult classic let alone one of afis 100 still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end its instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv its just not worth going out of your way to seebr br i give a 3 out of 10 br br spaceys other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe its true you need to fail before you succeedbr br by dane youssef
