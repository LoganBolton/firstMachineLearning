on the face of it this should be a great film a great cast a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywoods finest behind the camera for the first timebr br however its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again this movie fails on so many levels in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director not so here the great cast is horribly underused none more so than the great late john spencer the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you havent seen in a hundred other tv movies there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
