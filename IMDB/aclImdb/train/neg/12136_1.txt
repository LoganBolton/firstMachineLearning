i saw this movie on tv this afternoon and i cant see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash its not funny at all and it takes your iq down a few notches i know this movie is for kids but that doesnt mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a the word poop equals big laugh b a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net c kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up socalled ninjas with swords one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldnt scare anybody maybe the guys at mst3k could use this movie for a good laugh dont bother with this lameass excuse for a movie
