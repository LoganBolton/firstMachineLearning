mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the 90 mark the beautiful sets are here with all that made the hamer production values a trademark yet paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect the story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5 of your attention to be expectedbr br the directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play actors are mostly stiff as wax figures ok this is a hamer feature only its sometimes better featured in the whole package my conclusion this movie is trash not worth the time i spend that evening eternal life is a boring matter and i should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the cinemath√®que would have known better
