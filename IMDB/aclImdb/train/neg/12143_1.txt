first a little summary this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military  government censoring him nice message government censorship and all that but the way they did the movie was well let me explainbr br this movie is beyond description the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution the script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth graderas for special effects i understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire heres a tip buy some nonflammable material have an extinguisher ready and get a fire going dont digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game the acting well lets put it this way in my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this the godfather i wont even go into the inconsistencies find them yourselfbr br what disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said okay this looks good lets release it it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for dvd release this isnt dvd quality this isnt scifi channel quality hell this isnt even film school quality if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an f no not even an f more like an f i wouldnt be surprised if he would try to get you expelledbr br i felt used after i saw this thing blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and id prefer not to think of what theyre doing with it i have been the pawn of some elaborate nefarious scheme at legalized theft and it doesnt feel good to think that i walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 days later only to find a film ed wood would watch and say afterwards i didnt much care for this this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen i have not seen anything by ed wood but i have confidence this is worse if you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache if not i still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night however if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out you wont be disappointed
