honestly who in gods name gave this movie an 81 rating i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted otherwise this movie sucks this movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film im a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here the story and acting was the worst ive ever seen the props including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else im all for bad language in movies but the fbomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the fbomb in any movie ever the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film id expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesnt belong on a dvdbr br do not buy this movie do not rent this movie all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon this is valuable time that you will never get back unfortunately for me that time is lost but its not too late for you if you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning
