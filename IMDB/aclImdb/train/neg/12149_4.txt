set in providence rhode island feeding the masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government at best it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war but it ends up feeling hollow theres never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good worst the direction of the movie is atrocious focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond isnt this an odd way to hold the camera special effects are pretty badat one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city and its laughable at bestbr br the film does have a couple bright spotsnamely the advertisements for postzombie services including a reclamation service and a party bus but its far too little to make the film worthwhilebr br for a better zombie film try hide and creep it has the same weak production value but theres much more wit humor and talent behind it
