jesus christ i cant believe ive wasted my time watching this movie i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd but watching this film almost put me off her this is absolutely awful i could have been watching survivor series 93 over thisbr br the lead guy in this was so bland and generic i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove 91d his ass through a glass window i was enraging every time he was saying lake and cabin id kick his assbr br jordan ladd on the other hand was absolutely wonderful a true angel but she couldnt even save this utter joke of a film sadly she couldnt even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug it looked hilariousbr br i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her it reminded me of a time wherenevermindbr br anayways do watch this film because of its awfulness
