i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday intending to tunein to something else out of curiosity i accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end i really didnt do so with intent  this was one of those movies where youre fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano and their earlier roles but great isnt anywhere to be found anywhere here  story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hijinks we all know that perry mason before raymond burr passed the 300lb mark and ben matlock are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom instead of being boringly confined to a lectern and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of or shown them no reallife judge or prosecutor would stand for thisbr br both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer actually perry nearly always did this but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit pronounce it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party  sometimes oncamera sometimes presumed at the end of the showbr br but that said holland taylors histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of matlockmason moreclosely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in reallife courtroomsbr br every character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable  or some combination of two or more of thesebr br the ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible  but again fascinating because of this ladd and spano are attractive individuals and tv movies would appear their best forte  probably best in 2ndlead probably better if 3rd roles even in this venue taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them give this one 1 star for the storyperformances and 3 additional for the fascination factor
