this is not horror as the first part was this is campy light and humorous entertainment like in so many sequels the action starts right away with no explanations but theres boobs so i dont complain and real boobs that is if i understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in us of a which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela bruces sister springsteenbr br this cannot be thought without the first movie so i compare this to it again there is too small clothing mainly pants and funny hair its not hard to tell what decade this film is made in again there is really strange characters this time even more visibly pathological ones especially the personnel of the camp its like some mental rehabilitation summer camp people are older most of the actors must be at least 25 but i think theyre supposed to be 16 or something some methods used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant actually this movie dont have much in common with the first part and this is worse than it in every way
