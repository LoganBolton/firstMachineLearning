being a slasher film aficionado i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchises own designbr br now im assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp its good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but thats about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth campy requires bad acting but come on pamela springsteen as the evil outoftouchwithreality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i chuckled but it was few and far betweenbr br ultimately sac ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if youre looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on
