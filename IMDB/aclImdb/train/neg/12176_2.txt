the original trancers is not by any means a great movie it had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic however it was entertaining better done than most lowbudget bmovies and could be surprisingly witty unfortunately trancers ii is none of thesebr br trancers ii suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels the plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid it seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didnt bother with anything else not even veteran bgrade actors like tim thomerson and jeffery combs were able to drag this film out of the muckbr br a brief plot overview jack deth thomerson is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government trancers ii takes place six years after the events of the first trancers jack deth is married to lena helen hunt the woman he met in the first movie and both live with hap ashby the man deth was sent into the past to protect it is discovered that the brother of whistler the bad guy from the first movie has traveled back in time to create an army of trancers people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill ashby complicating jacks mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop whistlers brother and now jack finds himself working with herbr br i have two real problems with this movie one is that the method of creating trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie what makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of soviet revisionism they act like it was always the techniquebr br the other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between deth lena and alice stilwell jacks first wife is given very little screen time this bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie it felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie alices character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find hes remarried making her either very shallow or very poorly writtenbr br the only reason i can think of for watching this movie is if youre interested in watching the entire trancers series currently totaling six movies otherwise even if youre a fan of the original trancers stay away from this tepid sequel
