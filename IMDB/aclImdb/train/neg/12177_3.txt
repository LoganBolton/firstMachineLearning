since the 70s writerproducerdirector charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of sciencefiction fantasy and horror bmovies some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad trancers 1985 was one of those rare gemsbr br a terminator style tale of timetravel and action trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth a future cop given the task of tracking down badguy whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the trancers of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop himbr br in this 1991 sequel jack is still living in 1985 having destroyed whistler he has settled down and married leena helen hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie but for jack things dont stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of whistlers brother ed wardo who is trying to build a trancer armybr br trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was the story is difficult to pick up if you havent seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy oneliners and a script that feels like it was written ontheflybr br about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of scifi and horror movies jeffrey combs barbara crampton richard lynch martine beswicke unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an off day whilst filming trancers ii and performances are mediocre at bestbr br the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing i cant imagine them being any good
