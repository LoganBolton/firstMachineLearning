this film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentionalbr br the plot was beyond ridiculous i dont even think a 2 yearold would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to slap together into a story however on the positive side some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor for example wow lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard it gets worse and even funnier but ill spare youbr br the acting is generally laughable most of the kids roles are sort of cute but not very believable on the other hand annie is pretty awful allaround the adults dont take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing if theyd tried to be believable the film wouldve been even worse which is difficult to imaginebr br once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almostnotcrappiness the scene where lady hogbottoms son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though its an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police the butler character while very minor is a ray of sunlight that almost but never quite pierces through the gloombr br watching this movie actually caused me physical pain nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a 5 unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 thus i give it a 3br br thats being pretty generous id say
