this remake of the 1962 orginal filmo the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors  however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watchbr br deniro is a superb actor dedicated to giving his all in the work he does however he needs direction to focus his talent and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the filmbr br gregory pecks cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch even with as few lines as thisbr br nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzos oil but is not on the same form as weeds joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generationbr br some good points the start credits the first view of codys back when doing dips in the prison the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats sam bowdens decent into fullfledged panic codys outwardly calm but unnerving prescencebr br the worst the cleaning woman  but not really part clinging barehanded to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed are there no speed bumps in the us the hes dead  but not really parts and the aforementioned rambling endingbr br i may watch the original again but ive yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it
