while i cant deny that his movies are often entertaining i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities his use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream look at me arent i an imaginative director his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added flourishes the superlative raging bullbr br for this remake it appears it was business as usual though the dull film stock to convey a 1950s setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself the melodramatic closeups combined with the subpar imitation of the classic psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror the score for psycho was brilliantly unnerving this homage just sounds shrill and annoying even the cast who can be decent at times deliver histrionic performances that just scream caricature the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the bowden familybr br the worst acting offender here is surprisingly de niro sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away now im no expert on american accents me originally coming from near manchester in england an all but surely he couldve come up with a more convincing southern drawl than that being the gifted physical actor he is he almost overcomes this fatal flaw but not quite it was disconcerting for me as a de niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than rapt at his performancebr br possible spoilersbr br the overthetop style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale when will scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the killernotdeadyet cheap trick that less talented individuals might employbr br all in all a thoroughly ridiculous thriller scorsese and de niro have done much better work together
