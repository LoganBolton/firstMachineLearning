so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to mmm to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths anyhow by the end of while she was out i was left feeling rather indifferent not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives but theres easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced latenight survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car parkbr br the problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story along with the very variable performances the flimsy script was poorly thoughtout which isnt so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events as for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon terrorizing basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand dont ask me why knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didnt elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up basingers performance is stoutlike but doesnt craft much empathy craig sheffer shows up as her hotheaded husband strangely i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles aheadbr br susan montfords soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along i liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photographybr br no great shakes doesnt ask much of your time but i wouldnt care to see it again however with the inclusion of a joy division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen
