look i know this may suck right now but pain is temporary film is forever whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come  robert de nirobr br this was initially a film for steven spielberg the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro like jurassic park poltergeist and war of the worlds the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast the beast being the creation of the father a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial br br in typical spielberg fashion the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins like oscar schindler robin williams sam niel tom cruise and virtually every daddy figure in spielberg land the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoysbr br but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare the result is arguably the worst film in scorseses filmography and ironically his most illuminatingbr br an artists failures or misfires are often very revealing exposing the inner workings of their art when the story doesnt work the characters dont connect or the images dont sear we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core this  the remaining carcass is what the directors cinema is aboutbr br now cape fear is an impersonal film so we wont find any thematic connections to the rest of scorseses filmography you already sacrificed me de niro yells but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter what the film does though is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on watch how scorseses camera desperately whips back and forth how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention but more importantly watch how the film makes no spatial sense a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious soundstage a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the familys house doesnt seem to exist anywhere in particular there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment br br the reason for this is that scorseses camera always has to be bound or intimately tethered to his central character for the world around the character to make sense his camera has to be focused on the character resnais can take you around a french hotel welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building cameron can give you a tour of the titanic scott can recreate an entire future cityscape lucas can give you an alien desert planet and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook close upmid shotwide shot combinations but scorsese cant do this theres no poetry no sense of tangible space in his films hes all about the character you break that tether you leave that boxing ring that taxi cab you look away from de niro and everything collapses he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting which in a way is a prerequisite for action filmmakingbr br scorsese tried to rectify this problem with gangs of new york where the space and the sets become the central character but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis the actor drawing scorseses camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulbbr br 510  even as a generic bmovie this is an ugly vulgar looking film look at the matte paintings the inept attempts at tension the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown still we have robert de niro to pick up the slack de niro who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ gives the film its only great scene in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her a kind of symbolic rape the girl runs away both aroused and repelled by this mans interestbr br but de niros performance so deliciously over the top simply cant be imitated by scorsese youd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work but scorsese nopebr br worth one viewing
