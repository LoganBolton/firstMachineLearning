the actors did a really good job playing their rolesparticularly the mom however as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people and at times i felt irritated by the irresponsible and handsoff approach to parenting displayed again and again the daughter is a 17 yearold shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette complete with lots of booty shaking the son is a guy with low selfesteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friendsso much that he throws a drug party late in the film the husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gayoops i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks i think the authors attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system however given that these characters are not typical of the average western family it seems disingenuous
