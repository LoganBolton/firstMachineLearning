growing up with the beast wars transformers i wasnt very familiar with the original transformers and now that i have seen the awesome movie and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which its based i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast warsbr br not that i dont like the bw characters i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primalbr br i mean autobots transform and roll out sounds a lot better than maximals maximize the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that hes a real commander more so than optimus primalbr br besides powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus just look on the web br br megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original seriesbr br besides whats cooler robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars
