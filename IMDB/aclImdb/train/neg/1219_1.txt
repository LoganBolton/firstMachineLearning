first of all really kim basinger your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful most likely paid in cash for home and you cant even put on a decent shirt im a woman and yes im going to come right out say itclean something starting with your hair and while youre at it its christmas eve buy your kids some presentsor at least a christmas tree dont drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in and simply buy wrapping paper also the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note dont sign your name i refuse to feel sorry for della obviously due to the fact that kim basinger is this masterpieces executive producer she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman we get it alec baldwin is a jerk but seriously dont model horrible films after your own life also youre in you 50s you definitely wouldnt have 8 year old twins and those names terry and tammy way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves its also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a girlobviously ms basinger had some say about what goes in the script its also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back apparently dellas magical ninja skills are impossible to beat her driving skills are pretty nifty too this film is so clich√© it hurts wahhhhh they spelled your name wrong on the tea cup or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when youre at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at boohooo the fact that she refuses to take off that bright trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my pointthis woman is a moron who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car but not their purse full of identifying artifacts such as your address i have never wanted the bad guys to succeed as much as when i watched this film and did anyone else happen to catch the african american shirt the black guy was sporting oh yes rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet dont waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life instead go do what della couldnt figure out how to dotake care of your kids and maybe brush your hair that powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive singing ill be home for christmas in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets thanks della
