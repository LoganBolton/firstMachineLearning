while the original first blood had its farfetched moments it was at least exciting in parts in rambo first blood part ii the emphasis is shifted very much onto comicbook action plausibility is totally rejected logic nosedives stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission just like any other wishfulfilment actioner of that time eg invasion usa commando red scorpion rambo first blood part ii cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for if you can tell from the word go that rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers what is left to get excited aboutbr br imprisoned after the events of the first movie john j rambo sylvester stallone is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the far east the year is 1985 and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any american pows still trapped in the jungles of vietnam rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor colonel trautman richard crenna but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by marshall murdock charles napier rambos job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any american pows  if it doesnt he is to rendezvous with a chopper if it does he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge the beautiful and resourceful co bao julia nickson sure enough rambo discovers that there are pows in the camp but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of murdock who it seems doesnt really want to find any pows because of the political and military implications rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the pows and get his revenge on the treacherous murdockbr br the few good points of the film come from jack cardiffs polished photography jerry goldsmiths exhilarating score and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics beyond these scant pickings the film is a failure the actors are reduced to macho posturing the plot rings false the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable at the time of its release america was under the presidency of ronald reagan a man with simplistic and nearhysterical anticommunist sentiments for this reason contemporary audiences lapped up this commiebashing shootingfest as if it was the greatest movie of alltime transforming it into an undeserved box office success thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simpleminded action flick with a ludicrously high body count ludicrously dumb politics and a ludicrous hero
