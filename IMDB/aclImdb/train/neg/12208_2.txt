as an army veteran i was deeply offended by this film in my opinion it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon it was it would have been better received but it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas silly as it sounds wherever i went in europe in the late 80s people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film unrealistic hmm lets see a monosyllabic musclebound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pows in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats and he never misses running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm i could go on but im getting a headache i gave this a 210 only because its slightly better than rambo iii
