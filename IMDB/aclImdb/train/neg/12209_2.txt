years ago when i was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay and while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to i couldnt resist a free trip to the movies thats how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watchin a brain dead sort of way and technically the stunts and camerawork are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2 so why is the movie so bad well unlike the first rambo movie this one has virtually no plot rambo himself only says about 3 words other than grunts and yells there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant and stupid special effect and what stupifyingly awful special effects while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark and while the bad guys are using ak47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclearpowered tips the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al plus hot shots part deux also does a funny parody of the genrenot just this stupid scenebr br allinall a movie so dumb and pointless its almost like selfparody
