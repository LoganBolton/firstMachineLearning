george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wishfulfillment the united states clearly didnt win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that usamericans didnt appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do
