as low budget indies go you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say i didnt pay much for frightworldbr br writer  director david r williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer not a bad premise but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes the camera work tries to be too cleaver for its audience by constantly using shaky quickcuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us this becomes evident right off the bat as we are introduced to the wouldbe killer and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the acting remains the same frightworld does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the funhouse but with an extremely long running time it cant save the film from its below average indie hellbr br there is some mediocre nudity but not much for gore which is usually the saving grace for these types of moviesbr br fans of really bad bmovies might find something of interest here otherwise dont spend a lot of cash
