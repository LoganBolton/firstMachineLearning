this was a weird movie it started out pretty good a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thingbr br next comes his down fall here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy b movie poor acting  i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop these guys could not after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie startsbr br from this point on it is bad acting big boobs the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenesbr br that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake offbr br i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse
