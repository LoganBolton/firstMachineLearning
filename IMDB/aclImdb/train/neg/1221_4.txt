i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondieromantic interest or damsel in dangerbuteverything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie la confidentialand i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performancehoweverafter that momenther career did not follow the ideal pathsurethe prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies like people i know or the door in the floorbut we have never seen her again on a substantial characterthe movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation and it is not only that her character is not too tastybut also that the movie is really crappythe screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basichoweverbasinger brings some conviction to her characterand that makes this poor movie to win a few pointsthis movie is full of clich√©s and generic villainsthe work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainlybecause the movie never gets a good rhythm and tonethe ending from this movie is extremely ridiculousi do not recommend while she was out at allthis film commits the capital sin of being boring
