quite simply this shouldnt have been made its predictable and clich√©d the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the memorable lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking where my girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl 2 tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe im being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it aint broke dont fix it
