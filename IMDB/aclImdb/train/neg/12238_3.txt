a concept with potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together butbr br rudolphs glowing nose didnt require the explanation offered in this film  much like the force in the star wars films didnt need the explanation of medichlorians in the bloodstream but mainly the film left me cold because of winterbolts overcomplicated plot to destroy santa hes got the power to put suggestions into peoples minds so why does he do things in such a roundabout way breaking the magic of rudolphs nose framing rudolph threatening to melt the frosty familythe comedically exaggerated plots of pinky and the brain and phineas and ferbs dr doofenshmirtz which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs seem simple and straightforward compared to winterbolts which were expected to take somewhat seriouslybr br there is a particularly and amusingly strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy like boomerangs i understand if they dont want to have guns being shot in a family film but then why have guns in the first place
