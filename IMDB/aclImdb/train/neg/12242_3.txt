i expected a bad movie and got a bad movie but i couldnt really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was i dont even want to try to explain what blood surf is about is not about blood surfing but a big a crocodile they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws but spielberg was wise and didnt show the shark until the end here the crocodile is shown a lot of times and its the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen and they dont try to hide it if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake placid br br the director had an opportunity to make a decent surfshark movie but he had to make a bad bmonster movie he had the chance to make an original surf movie but he wanted to make a monster movie so you have understand how bad this movie is does it have some good parts not really it got some nudity and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie the acting isnt half bad either and kate fischer looks good too bad she doesnt take her top off the lead actors arent bad either they had some potential the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes the blame is on the untalented writer and director the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen and the script is really badly written and the director got no talent what so ever and not much of a fantasy eitherbr br dont watch it even if you want to watch the beautiful kate fischer it isnt worth it watch sirens to watch kate nude and watch lake placid if you want some good crocodile actionbr br 310 because im in a good mood and maureen larrazabal looks good naked and kate looks good but is bad actressand dex miller joel west and matt borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sht they had to work with
