i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was wrong terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sexkilling scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a good movie people will watch that if you havent seen it i beg you dont bother
