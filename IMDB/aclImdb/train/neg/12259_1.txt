a movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in sharkinfested waters as an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters i thought this might be my kind of movie it wasnt this should be more of a guideline of how not to do it it has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air it looks ridiculous good for a laugh though if it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile it would be at least worth a laugh but it gets worse id guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was so they though up the old idea of sex sells totally i mean totally without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast and somewhere towards the beginning theres some kind of meaningless makeout this is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me its incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish if you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie
