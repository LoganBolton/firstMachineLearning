well let me start off by saying how utterly hilarious this film is i simply couldnt keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it dont get me wrong it is well acted particularly by bassinger but the script is just well the mind boggles trulybr br the premise is good and up until della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill  half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guys head she decides to pull out a screwdriver car jack and finally a flare as in for a sinking ship respectively to kill her victimsbr br then there is the final line that i promise if it doesnt have you in stitches then i will eat my own left footbr br i would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned appalling film making might i also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood gets me every time
