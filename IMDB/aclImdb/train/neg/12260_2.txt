sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks andor crocodiles are still getting made these days theyve been making these lame jawscopies since the 70s its not like theyre getting any more wellliked the idea is still exactly the same so we have an animal that starts murdering people first it takes down some secondary characters then it starts attacking the main characters usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous who usually plays a specialist one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow usually with an explosion then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive or has laid eggs etc etc krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation unless you count the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation in that case your standards are pretty low its funny that hes played by duncan regehr though he like totally used to be zorrohell ill give it a bonus point for that
