standard paintbynumbers monster fare filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from bigcreature movies its like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them which were shuffled and dealt whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script br br characters are so clich√©ridden that you can play a game of guess who ends up as a monster meal after less than ten minutes into the movie and probably get every single one rightincluding the order that they will get devoured many of the characters are so obnoxious that you root for the creature to shut them up some of the main characters include a billy idol clone who surfs with sharks a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls a capt ahab guy with a vendetta and ahabs girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar oh and a big big beast in need of anger management therapybr br along the way people argue a lot pretty girls run around with wet tshirts couples make out on exotic beaches explosions occur ruins of a shrine appear and greasyfaced pirates drop by br br amusing for the most part but one thing bothered me the callousness by characters when other people were killed after one violent demise they make oneliner jokes i could almost hear rim shotsbr br overall ok if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at a sobaditsgoodmovie otherwise you may want to skip this one
