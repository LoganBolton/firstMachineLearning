fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulphorror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal crocodile directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and lake placid blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwatercrocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long  and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surferdudes  dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a sharkcongested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though its a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous theres a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake theyre not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielbergs great white shark the visual effects in blood surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i wont say too much about the acting since its secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but funny for a whole other reason than james hickox intended
