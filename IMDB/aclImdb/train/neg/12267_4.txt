speaking solely as a movie i didnt really liked it not because there were no fx or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film actually that was what kept me watching itbr br i didnt like it because the acting was shady his friends are all happy and then theyre mad but you have no idea why then they take distinct roles one is the believer other is the antagonist but they never really make the point also the lighting was terrible and im just mentioning technical issuesbr br in a few words i thing the movie could have just had a ok im outta here from some characters like the lady who doesnt want to hear his version of the biblebr br about the story itself everyone is free to write about what they want and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination i credit the book author for that hence my 410br br so in the end hear the mans story believe it or not just dont spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you dont believe himbr br coherencebr br thanks for reading
