ive seen about four other japanese horror films and they werent too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the waybr br not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the moviebr br bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who dont have much to do with the story ive seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case herebr br also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up andthen it just cuts to another scene im aware that this can be a dramatic effect thats definitely not the intention here its just bad editingbr br finally theres the ghost who just screams in a way thats not scary or unintentionally funny its annoying and it happens a lot throughout the moviebr br all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued it was better than the whole film simply put avoid
