the japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production workbr br someone in hollywood needs to remake this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy theres something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorterbr br i do have to say that the sixthsense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginningbr br as it stands only the diehard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this ohsoboring movie
