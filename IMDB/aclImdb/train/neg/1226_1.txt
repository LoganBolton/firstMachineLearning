my how the mighty have fallen kim basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role this movie is bad for one reason in particular lapses in logic its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid this is the worst thriller ive ever seen and ive seen the bone collector and twistedbr br the story details dellakim basingeris just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid from then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of toolsbr br so many things are wrong with this movie as i said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of kim basinger the acting is madefortv bad hell this pseudo thriller is madefortv bad the way she kills each of these politically correct thugs1 caucasian 1 hispanic 1 asian and 1 african american all coming together to stalk a caucasian woman dont you just love americais laughable to a fault the way she killed the hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically the sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame i only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else anybody else especially kim basinger fans would do well not to own this flick you dont want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you of course not you were warned
