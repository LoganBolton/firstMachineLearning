the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weakimplausible story line miscasting and general lack of contentsubstance one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didnt know how to pronounce his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br movies solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song i dont recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast
