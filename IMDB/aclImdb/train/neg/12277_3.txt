i found the arab conspiracy in a bargain bin and thought id uncovered a lost treasure folks theres a reason why you dont hear much about this film the plot is muddy the pacing is slow cornelia sharpe is about as vivacious as plain cold tofu and the ending leaves you flat not even sean connery can save this one
