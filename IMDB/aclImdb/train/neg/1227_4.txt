even though many people here praises this movie i have to warn you it has no logic whatsoever i think that basinger does a decent job at acting but you cant make a thriller if there is a great lack of realismbr br this scene paints a good picture for you of the movie  while basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket the picture is from her daughter and it reads we love you mommy who does something like that  what the eff and believe me when i say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie someone stated that this is a hidden gem well i have to strongly disagree this movie has stayed hidden for a reason and its not a gem oh and please i dont even want to start commenting about the red toolbox it hurts my brain d usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic but i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic it has certain mood that kept me watching till the endbr br so if you choose to watch this you know you have been warned
