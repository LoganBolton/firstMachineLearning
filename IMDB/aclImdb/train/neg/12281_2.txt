hearing such praise about this play i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable i dont see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand i guess if you have an interest in stories about womens private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you otherwise its rather dull and boring if anything i found it a bit degradingbr br i inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well so its not just a guy not getting it
