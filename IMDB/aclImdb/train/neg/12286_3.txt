the summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is slaughterhouse rock is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen a title previously held by urban legends final cut from its opening scene i could tell its going to be really bad but i was so bored that i couldnt care less this film contains laughable acting especially by the guy whos tormented in his dreams incredible as in not credible plot twists and some of the crappiest music ive heard and im living in a period when the likes of britney spears and nsync dominate the air waves the biggest problem with slaughterhouse rock is that its not funny one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny oneliners here and there but no we have tormented guys selfcentered friend trying to be funny but came across as annoying instead spoiler and please do tell me who in this crazy world is insane and selfloathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night no one if youre going to make a horror movie at least make it believable this one is anything but
