this movie is so bad its good  in an unintentionally funny way i couldnt stop watching it i was laughing so much its like a parody of a romantic thriller except its not a parody br br alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preachers wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you hes no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea theyre in a really awful film theyre playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous  first the shootout in the church then lukes final words to emily  i was howling with laughter br br evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso thats probably the highlight of the film
