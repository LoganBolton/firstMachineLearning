i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh ive had in a long while the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey saviers impressive abs alexandra paul i think thats her name is horrendous as the preachers wife who has a history of depression ted mckenzie is gross and his characters a twit on top of it all and as if the fact that you think shes having sex with her son isnt enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him
