this film is a pure failure i am a steve martin fan but even he cant save the tired idea and swiss cheese script think police academy 7 and apply it to a military parody yuckbr br i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received and rightfully deserved it is extremely misleading i have often seen this film marked down to 300 in the grocery store and now i certainly know whybr br if only i could get my 90 minutes back
