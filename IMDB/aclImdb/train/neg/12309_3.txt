this was a disappointing movie considering the materialarmy life is always good for a laughand the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin williams lead and someday win an oscar
