words cant describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro  what were you thinking  so theres a mall and its parking space is totally full basingers character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paperbr br when she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby  even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place  come on  i wont even go into the infamous red toolbox since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by onebr br this is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it its a total waste of time honestly
