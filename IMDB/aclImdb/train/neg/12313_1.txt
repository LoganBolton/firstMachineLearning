this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made but it certainly was far from his best obviously he did this crap for the pay check dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man what he doesnt seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie they expect to be entertained not bored to tears its sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him i dont understand why talented people cant get a grip on the fact that people dont want to see them in lousy movies if youre going to call a movie a comedy then it should be funny this wasnt shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum too full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a service comedy surely phil silvers is rolling over in his grave
