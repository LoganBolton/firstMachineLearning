maybe im really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman thats me schultz lordy lordy what i would give to see the light firstly that phil silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled youll never get rich 195559 could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt bilko it is very hard to picture any other actorcomedian in the business wearing those master sergeants stripesbr br such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of careerwrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like clayton morethe lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle crocs blockbr br one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950s tv screen to the 1990s moviegoing public is our collective memory without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apartbr br so as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please lets consider some other pointsbr br right here today the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years furthermore ive enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko 96 costars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others alumni of nbcs saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing but a bilko remake it just didnt clickbr br perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked em but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like mebr br so weve already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately whats next howse about somebody doing hal roachs world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday  ames and tvs 1st cartoon series crusader rabbit remember where you heard it first poodle schnitz
