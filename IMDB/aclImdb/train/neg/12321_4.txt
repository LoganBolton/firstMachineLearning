seeing as i hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible downright terrible and not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review i thought i might agree with him seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie definitely lacks goodlooking females let me be the first to say wow that was definitely some serious indepth reviewing there my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie seriously though a lack of goodlooking females shouldnt be considered an essential to a movie if youre desperate enough for goodlooking females you should really watch other types of movies not necessarily falling into the scifi category
