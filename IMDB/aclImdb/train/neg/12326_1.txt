a woman sylvia kristel seduces a 15 year old boy eric brown they have sexbut its all tied into some stupid plot or somethingbr br easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation i suppose its ok cause its a teenage boyif we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would rightfully be outrage sorry but having it done to a boy doesnt excuse it its still sick i realize brown was of age he was actually 18 when this was made but he looks 15 i just find it disturbing that some people find this okbr br plot aside the acting sucks kristel is beautifulbut cant act brown is easily one of the worst child actors ive ever seen and the constant nudity gets boring and isnt even remotely eroticbr br i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin who could easily pass for 18 he wanted to see iti didnt but i decided what the heck we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through let me make this clearthree teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity that should give you an idea of how bad this is im surprised this was ever released a 1 all the way
