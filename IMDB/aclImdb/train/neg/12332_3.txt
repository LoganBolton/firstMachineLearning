the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic crossbreeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic castbr br im afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves adam brooks script may well be to blame but youd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda instead the two pingpong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around francebr br jean reno costars amiably as the copwithaheart and i guess wishes he was a starwithapart mind you he went on to do those pink panther remakes so perhaps he was ok with this 310
