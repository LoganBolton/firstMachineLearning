the premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd br br believe me im a fan of kevin kline but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it soundsbr br for her part meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a take your pick kewpie doll baby puppy kitten whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human beingbr br this movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being wellpaid for it so i cant really blame them
