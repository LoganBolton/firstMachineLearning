kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always worth watchingbr br i say nearly and almost in large part because of this moviebr br first off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weakwilled whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesnt give up until several days later that said kevin klines character is even more annoying and less likeable so even if you normally like these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass
