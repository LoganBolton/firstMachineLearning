horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century way before the scary movie series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the 80s but like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss some like elvira mistress of the dark mostly rise above that but other like saturday the 14th and its sequel fail to deliver the laughs but out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and thats transylvania 65000 a major waste of time for many reasonsbr br pros a great cast that does its best some of the dopey humor is amusing a corny but catch theme song some good transylvanian locationsbr br cons threadbare plot mostly tedious pacing most of the humor just doesnt cut it the monsters are given little to do and little screen time i thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies lame ending that will likely make viewers angrybr br final thoughts this is a comedy if it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn aching for it to be over i cant believe anchor bay released this tired junk ill admit its not one of the worst films ever made but its not worth anyones time or money even if youre a fan of any of the actors see transylvania twist insteadbr br my rating 25
