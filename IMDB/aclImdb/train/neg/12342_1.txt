anyone familiar with my reviews on the internet movie database will know that i can be a grumpy bastard from time to time there are a lot of films i dont like which for some unfathomable reason ive felt the urge to review however if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film ive ever seen look no further than transylvania 65000 without question this takes the title of the alltime no 1 awful film i cant believe that i actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finishbr br it is clearly meant to capture the flavour of mel brookss young frankenstein but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material jeff goldblum and ed begley jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day transylvania perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud during their research they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites such as vampires werewolves and mummiesbr br anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom it marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way it results in awesomely dire entertainment
