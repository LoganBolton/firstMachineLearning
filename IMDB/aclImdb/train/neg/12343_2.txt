oh brother the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because its at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film when they werent yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny ted healy but even as a longtime stooges fan id have to say that young moe larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to mr healys taller boss janitor theyre not featured steadily through the movie and their silly onandoffagain stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusingbr br most of this toothache deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates baron munchausen heres a good example of the level of humor i object on what grounds coffee grounds his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore
