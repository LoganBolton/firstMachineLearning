this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radios baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 712 decades later its being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pittsbr br as for the stooges this is a film from there very early daysbefore mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on himyoull see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film rolesincluding acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didnt act as a teamthey just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the pianobr br this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety showpunctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for durante i never knew what the public saw in himas least as far as his films are concernedhe was loud andloud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keatons career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudevillestyle routines that tend to fall rather flatbr br in this film the stooges they didnt yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though diehard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of seeing everything stoogeeven the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curlybr br overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role youd certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a socalled precode scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title its a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything its quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades see the film youll see that i mean
