this films basic premise is a political cartoon i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feelgood film on gender equality indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what claptrap no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately demi moore buffing up for seal hell week in the early 27 week buds program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so there is approximately an 80 dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program  those are the ones who voluntarily drop out cant compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or cant handle the psychological harassment i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived purported message of this film in the real world demi wouldnt last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training wishing alone wont do it skip this film as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading the warrior elite by dick couch crown new york 2001for the best description as to what really goes on in this training ring the bell demibr br
