this movie is very much like flashdance you know that dance flick with jennifer beals that film is probably the most boring film i have ever seen since its not even bad enough to be funny gi jane is much better than that film but that doesnt say much here demi moore sweats a lot and theres high music and we get to see her fight and everything but it is certainly not very engaging i really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting but the script is too clich√©d and ridley scott cant do anything about that well like i said its better than flashdance 410
