a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott gi jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character oneil played by demi moore there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldnt reach it properly it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the filmbr br i really cant understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique when i look at his latest film black hawk dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill the whole finale in gi jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killingbr br this is ridley scotts worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known still im glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scotts abilities but they are very few in this filmbr br a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics blade runner thelma  louise alien and so on of this talented director so im forced to give gi jane 410
