naturally i didnt watch gi jane out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my exgirlfriends housebr br gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isnt the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictablebr br gi jane fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism and therefore entertaining gi jane tries to be real and failsbr br this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott with a very noncredible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason i give it 210 instead of 110 is for some of the technical work
