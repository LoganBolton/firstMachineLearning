after reading through many of the reviews i dont know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasnt the same one i sawbr br this movie is horrible the acting primarily moores is just terrible the woman cannot act nice tits but she just cant act at no point did she come across as the actual character instead it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play makebelieve with the boysbr br and thats what this movie ultimately is  hollywood makebelieve the training sequences are over the top the politics  over the top the political correctness  over the top the combat scenes  you guessed it over the top your mission is to get in and get out without being detected so what do you do why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course oh gi jane you can be my wing man anytimebr br the premise is good but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with top gun with titsbr br what more is to be expected from commercial us films anymore not much i guess
