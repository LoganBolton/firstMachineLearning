watching this movie was a waste of time i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but i resisted i dont know what ridley scott intended but i learned that in the army women get as stupid as men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and thats also a waste of time in my opinion and anyway what the hell was that final scene in lybia are they still fighting gadafi or is it that its easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger
