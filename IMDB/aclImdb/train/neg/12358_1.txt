demi moores character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a womans physical ability to perform the types of tasks requiredbr br trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyones intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting
