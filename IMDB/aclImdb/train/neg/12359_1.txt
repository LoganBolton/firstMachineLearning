i thought this was a truly awful filmi found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times one or both of the gay male leads was miscast there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard ruccolo looked like hed rather be kissing a dog the movie covers their long and tortured courtship highlighting each breakup and makeup but not developing the reasons inbetween in any detail these reasons would make for some interesting characters not the fight or the makeup scene in bed lame even if you liked the moviebr br andrea martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters but it doesnt make the film worth renting save your money
