why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over againbr br this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years i obviously wasnt embracing my inner masochistbr br as bucatinskys writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom more character development would have been helpful we are never acquainted with elis masochism in fact we are led to believe that he is not a masochist although toms psychoemotional sadism is highly evident
