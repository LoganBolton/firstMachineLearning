i saw this recent woody allen film because im a fan of his work and i make it a point to try to see everything he does though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort they were right this is a confused movie that cant decide whether it wants to be a comedy a romantic fantasy or a drama about female midlife crisis it fails at all threebr br alice mia farrow is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children this rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs and the ghost of a former lover with whom she flies over manhattan if these additions sound too fantastic for you how about something more prosaic like an affair with a saxophone playerbr br i was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say there are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film and the endingis a really preposterous touch of pollyannabr br rent crimes and misdemeanors instead a superbly welldone film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals or go back to annie hall or manhattan
