loony tunes have ventured at least twice into the future the first time was with the brilliantly funny duck dodgers the latter time was with this  um  effort loonatics unleashed isnt without merit and might be considered a good product were it not that it isnt up to warner brothers quality wb cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor appealing at least as much to adults as to children these pedestrian superhero episodes on the other hand cannot fail to convince adults to pass them upbr br the premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals 2 bunnies a tasmanian devil a duck a roadrunner and a coyote live on the cityplanet of acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772 whats confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a countup to 2772 from the 21st century cute but frelling stupidbr br in each episode the super sextet  amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter  fight various super villains for the most part these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones like many mediocre superhero series this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context and of course these guys are the only characters that laugh  the usual evil laugh of course why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always  always  laugh evilly at every opportunity animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and occasionally their henchpeople andor henchthingsbr br in point of fact the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the getgo the superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities but sometimes not the problem here is that we dont see enough wb looniness lexi and ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as bugslike what we have here is basically the silly and drekish teen titans including its overly modern animation look but with animals fehbr br the other misstep by the programs creators is or are the villains as noted before these are not terribly imaginative and do the evillaugh bit excessively amazingly the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock wb characters as well as the protagonists adding to the fun could have been say jupiter sam  as well as the fudd still hunting wabbits  as well as tech e coyote converted into a really neurotic villain  and so on ah the sadness of missed opportunitiesbr br sadly this whole production has gone into too much overtime that is a 2nd season nevertheless we can rejoice that theres something new out there for the 14goingon9 crowd the rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of duck dodgers
