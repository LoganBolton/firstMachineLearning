i had high expectations of this movie the title translated is how we get rid of the others after all the concept is great a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the rightwing governments constant verbal and legislative persecution of socalled freeloaders and the left wing in general and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that theyre contributing something to the establishment the establishment being called the common good but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideologybr br very cool idea ideal for biting satire only this movie completely blows its chance the satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity but this satire is not sustained it is neither sharp nor witty and for an alleged comedy the movie has nearly no funny scenes the comedy i assume is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations but the situations are largely uncomfortable and overserious rather than evoking either laughter or thoughtbr br the script is rife with grave errors in disposition the action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun and whos trying to save everybody by organizing a resistance that ships people to africa all this is beside the point a movie like this should not pretend to be so serious its a satire a political statement but it doesnt even begin to actually address the problem its supposed to be about maybe it was afraid of going too far how cowardly thats not art its not even real satirebr br s√∏ren pilmark a very serious and by now one of denmarks absolutely senior actors was very good he largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had everybody else nothing special well perhaps except for lene poulsen who did supply a convincing performancebr br in fact a problem with most danish movies is that the language never sounds natural neither the formulation nor the delivery why is it so difficult to make it sound right why must it be so stilted and artificial i hope when people look at these movies fifty years from now they dont think that this was how people talked in general danish societybr br 3 out of 10
