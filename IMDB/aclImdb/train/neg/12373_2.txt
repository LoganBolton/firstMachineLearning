the script is so so laughable this in turn makes the actors lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed theres repetition of phrases  my sweet little god daughter and minor variations of that line which comes to mind and its just sloppy soap opera dialogbr br worse yet the music is so wrong plus the main bluesy theme is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this and it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation texture and arrangement of this theme never changes even when the scenes emotional context doesbr br subsequently whenever it appears it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to anotherbr br the musics corny and its as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom  a low budget 80s canadian sitcom at that  and this makes it feel as if were always on the brink of throwing to a commercialbr br this is so miscast theres a lot of overacting and its a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only one type of ny accent  a thick bronx accent i dont know if its a question of the actors limited capacity in only knowing one ny accent  or whether its a question of the directors ability to notice such an glaring anomalybr br in the end its the amateur script with its leaden lines which makes this entire movie blow when any foundation is shaky and unstable its impossible to build upon it without its flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways
