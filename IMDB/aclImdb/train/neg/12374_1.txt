i dont remember seeing another murdermystery movie as bad as this this movie about a medical examiner who investigates his friends mysterious death in a car accident has the complete receipt for a bad movie bad acting boring story lack of suspense poor humor and no drama i remembered seeing this movie on pax a tv station notable for dishing out lowbudgeted and campy madefortv movies such as this one tv movies of course do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen but this movie sure hit all sour tastes the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making receipe for murder a great tv movie the title does offer some suspensebr br so if you want a good recipe dont watch this movie this movie alone can kill your tv appetitebr br grade f
