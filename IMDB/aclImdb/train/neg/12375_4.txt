the good thing about this thats at least fresh almost no movies about dance music and the club scene if even made hit the cinemas and it radiates lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of ibizabr br but the main problem is that it cant decide what it wants to be although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of this is spinal tap the makers also realized they wouldnt want to play copycat however it fails grossly on the jokes because its not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped and it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes so why not edit it down to 75 the production department and cinematography still try to save the day eg pauls homebr br in a strange way and unexpectedly so its all gone pete tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of almost famous especially the scenes with beatriz batarda offer some acting powerbr br conclusion its a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club
