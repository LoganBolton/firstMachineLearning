this collection really sucksbr br i rented it thinking i´d really would enjoy some good fighting man this sucked quick flashy cuts an extremely annoying speaker and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened i´m thinking especially of jet li´s fight in fists of legend and jackie chan´s fight from drunken master 2br br and what´s the deal with those brawling streetfighters what´s so cool about that i´ve seen more interesting fights on martial lawbr br this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid peoplebr br do not ever buy this film do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crapbr br instead go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory
