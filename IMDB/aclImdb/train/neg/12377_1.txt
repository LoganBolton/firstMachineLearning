just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid if your child likes this film youd better have himher tested i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad this film is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else the writing is horrid i cant remember when ive heard such bad dialogue the songs are beyond wretched the acting is subpar but then the actors were not given much who decided to employ joey fatone he cannot sing and he is ugly as sinbr br the worst thing is the obviousness of it all it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible great childrens movies are wicked smart and full of wit  films like shrek and toy story in recent years willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past but in the continual dumbingdown of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo yes thats right the recent charlie  the chocolate factory and eyecrossing trash like red riding hood
