lipstick is another glossy movie failurei am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie and i am having trouble coming up with somethingi guess the red dress that margaux hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best partthe writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encounteredbut it could have been a lot better lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to viewthe sets were very glossy and nice to look atthe cast was okay i felt like anne bancrofts character was the only feasible character in the entire movieit was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one
