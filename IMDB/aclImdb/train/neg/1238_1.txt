this tim burton remake of the original planet of the apes from 1968 and starring charleton heston is a far far cry from the quality and plot of the originalbr br certainly special effects have improved since 1968 but writing has not the characters were boring and the dialog was awful i sat through the entire film with a friend who thankfully only rented it and completely understood why before christmas all of the planet of the apes toys at target were in the clearance binbr br my advice to tim burton dont put this on your resumebr br my advice to everyone else watch the original 1968 planet of the apes movie
