being a big fan of the other planet of the apes films i rented this dvd despite my aversion to all things tim burton once again he doesnt fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction even the ape makeup looks second rate which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity mark wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor as if boogie nights wasnt proof enough i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter no doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldnt possibly have been the clicheridden screenplay i rented this dvd on a special 1 night and i still feel ripped off
