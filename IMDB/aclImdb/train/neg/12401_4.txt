i am at a distinct disadvantage here i have not seen the first two movies in this series although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films fans of the series seem to think this is a good film judging it on its own it was pretty boringbr br you never get a real good look at the maniac cops robert zdar face but what i did see was pretty grim the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills maybe if i saw the nc17 directors cut i may be more impressedbr br the ending with the car chase with zdar caitlin dulany and robert davi was pretty intense best part of the movie
