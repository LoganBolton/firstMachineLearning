i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films a couple of them werent bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goodytwo shoes movies like these rarely get praisebr br nonetheless i cant defend this movie either you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is cornier than corny if you know what i mean it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hourandahalfbr br the story basically is andy mickey rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some d√©butante from new york city as if that was the ultimate people were a lot more socialconscious in the old days youd hear the term socialclimber as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life its all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so todaybr br however its about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made as you could find also if you like to hear judy garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andys heart oh man i almost throw up even writing about this
