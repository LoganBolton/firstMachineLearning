if youre going to look after a child make sure they dont live anywhere near a graveyard especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her friends but our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs shacks up with her family the nortons which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the casts tendency to talk even when their lips arent moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths but enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra wont shut up during any scene even the quiet ones oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones onbr br in fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather smelt what theyd signed up for and gone awol yes i know its hard to get into movies these days but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv youd want if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett and another almost equally as bad by the charismafree child actress rosalie cole the next dakota fanning she aint the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climaxbr br this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on but back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it so do they stay where they are safe no of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like shes having a nervous breakdownbr br finally the film closes it doesnt end it just goes to a grinding halt the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened but my dear viewer something horrible has happened you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained boring horror films youre ever likely to see and lost 82 minutes of your life youll never get back just think years from now on your deathbed what youd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family sadly its already too late for me dont you make the same mistake  210
