this movie was seriously awful the acting was the worst it was worse than a student film super cheesy and i think the worst actor was the old lady at first i thought to myself well its an old movie then i remembered that that is no excuse ive seen older movies with way better acting and suchbr br the music was terrible to it was really choppy the editing was poor most of the dialog was out of syncbr br overall this movie doesnt even deserve a 1 i only watched it because i was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me it was just laughable my dead grandmothers left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this
