there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies  but this film certainly isnt one of them its a shame the child isnt better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes we have the idea of a vengeful child which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie the plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do this is all well and good except for the fact that its boring nothing happens for most of the film and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore its not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish theres really not much i can say about the film overall as there isnt much to it the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly dont recommend it
