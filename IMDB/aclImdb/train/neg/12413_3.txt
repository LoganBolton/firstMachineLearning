im not going to say that this movie is horrible because i have seen worse but its not even halfway decent br br the plot is very confusing i couldnt really figure out what was happening and where things were going when the movie was over i was left scratching my head i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two br br character development is very shallow i couldnt figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone i couldnt tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them this film seems to be based around stereotypes to its credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which should make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters this film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possiblebr br another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation i guess thats ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didnt get a chance to know any of them so i never really missed any of thembr br and last but not least was sadies singing its awful the music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadies vocal cords i swear that theres one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howlathonbr br as a whole this movie is confusing characters are illdeveloped georgias acting is wooden and stiff sadies character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation the music was unbearable and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain
