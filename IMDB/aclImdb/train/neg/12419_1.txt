tainted look at kibbutz lifebr br this film is less a cultural story about a boys life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and its all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellevil br br the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every charactersituation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasnt seen in a long time due to his military service he orders quote  linda go take shower and i cum in two minutes br br there is one other good character in this movie  a european foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapists arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act thats supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse br br the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose its a mystery how the boys father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son br br thats the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head  that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in i feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs
