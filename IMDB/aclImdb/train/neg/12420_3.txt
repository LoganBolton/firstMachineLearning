there just isnt enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turdbr br the whole time i was watching it i was thinking geez i could do better than that and im a moron dont believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didnt deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they werent the best but they just didnt have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed
