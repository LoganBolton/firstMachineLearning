cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80s thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs and lethal weapon this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in nam but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft although hes huge lou has the brain of a child one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them but paybacks a mother they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing that is until these two thugs come into the picture one of thems a real nice guy who have a plan in mindbr br the films a waste of time maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked alas it doesnt and the audience is left holding the bag oh well its too bad because you have all the elements for a great bmovie better luck next time i guessbr br not recommendedbr br xxx
