this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen watch part 1 and two but dont let anyone say that this is better than the first two i mean really you dont make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this want a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie culkin is too old now so youre suppose to stop making sequels goodness this movie makes me sick buy part 1 and 2
