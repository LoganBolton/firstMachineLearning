in 1987 john hughes wrote and directed planes trains and automobiles which was a hilarious and poignant comedy  the best thing hes ever done ten years on hes reduced to again recycling the plot of home alone in this second sequel which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic the four crooks  thats right four and one of them is a girl congratulations hughes for introducing this revolutionary change to the series  are electrocuted with metal chairs brained with barbells and blinded with paint ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha while the new kid is even less charming than culkin youd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from fossilising the same old routines but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for home alone 4
