the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so its like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite badthough the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almostbutnotquiteasgood score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good nonoriginal music but its just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but its still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old onesand they make fun of spystuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of themand thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesnt work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a childrens filmand there was a sexual joke or two though that isnt the first time in the series its also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoony violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 310
