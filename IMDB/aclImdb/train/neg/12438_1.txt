beating the bad guys again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about itbr br home alone one and two film classics home alone three and four a good film if youre three like sharkboy and lavagirl as hard as it tries to be funny its not culkin is replaced by alex dlinz or something else hes a very bland actor with bland performances but its not entirely his fault the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and youd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day and to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you dont believe me but youll regret it
