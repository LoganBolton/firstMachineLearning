the first home alone was one of the funniest movies of the 90s the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes now comes home alone 3 i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin wouldve been 17 by 1997 he could take care of himself right so what does the director decide to do he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots i dont really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie but please id recommend that youd stay away from it its not worth your precious time go fold a piece of paper do chores balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap its better to do then to watch home alone 3br br 110
