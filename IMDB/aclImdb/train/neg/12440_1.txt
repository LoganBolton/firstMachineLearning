this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash ive ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed woods plan 9 is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one ¿special effectsagain plan 9 is star wars ¿actingthor johnson is al pacino so its beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies its for you im a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the pricecormanpoe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with star creatures they descend right down to the z level of course my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can
