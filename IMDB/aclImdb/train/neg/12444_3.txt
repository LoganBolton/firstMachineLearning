gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumesbr br i love 50 sci fi i even love cheesy 50s sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a mst3k kinda waybr br virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best hip cat impression of abott  costellobr br chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moon but it cant in this case this film requires a mute button and fast forward featurebr br that said i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
