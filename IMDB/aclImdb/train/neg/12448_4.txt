clint eastwood is bronco billy the leader of a wild west troupe one of six regular misfits who comprise a strugglingtobreakeven touring show the seventh member of the bunch is a woman billys assistant but such women never last long and the position is chronically open enter antoinette lilly sandra locke  eastwoods girlfriend at the time it seems miss lilly as doc scatman crothers calls her is a wouldbe heiress who will only receive her longdeceased fathers estate if shes married by the time she turns 30 so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish geoffrey lewisbr br so whats the plot of this film its hard to say theres the romantic tension between billy and miss lilly but the problem is that for the first half of the movie shes so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes one of the troupe halfway through the film its not only unbelievable but the audience is well past caring about her theres the chronic lack of funds behind the wild west show but this topic isnt touched upon enough to really be the raison detre of the film theres miss lillys predicament of being stranded in the rural west cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury shes mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press but are we really supposed to believe that she couldnt get back to new york and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effortbr br no the point of this film seems to be that billy is the leader of a family a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin this is a warm fuzzy film  or at least tries to be br br along the way clint shows us his skills with a gun even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively nonviolent film one of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge billy bribes the local sheriff the shows tent burns down an orphanage makes them a new one but numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot makebr br compounding the problem is the acting or lack thereof aside from scatman crothers the supporting cast is quite amateurish eastwood isnt on top of his game either though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunchbr br and for all this the film plods on for 116 minutes to what point good question  br br 4 out of 10
