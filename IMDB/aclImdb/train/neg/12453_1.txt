i had always been a big lynda carterwonder woman fan so when the scifi channel ran this moviei had to see iti was bitterly disappointedthis is a wonder woman movie in name onlyshe doesnt wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor mans james bondtheres none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success ie the superhuman strength or determined willits just one long bad dreami dont even think cathy is all that attractive anywayi wouldnt waste your time on this
