i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old i was a huge comic book reader at the time and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily the end result however was underwhelmingbr br i was aware of the emma peel diana prince stories as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form however there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie the final costume was an interesting idea but looked more like a cheerleader than a superherobr br i saw the movie again in my late teen years it hadnt improved much cathy lee crosby was more familiar thanks to thats incredible but her acting was no better the script had a few good ideas like the rogue amazon and a decent villain in ricardo montalban but it just didnt come together and was still boringbr br i think they should have built the back story better and built the show into a more epic climax it was too much like a bland spy film crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book the amazon elements were intriguing but needed to be expandedbr br the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if a bit too camp and low budget the budget was also pretty low here and superheroes dont come cheapbr br it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd if only as a comparison and historical document even superman 4 is available and it has nothing over this film except chris reeve and gene hackman its worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions
