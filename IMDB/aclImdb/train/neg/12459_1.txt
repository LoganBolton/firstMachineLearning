considering how much money was budgeted for this film you would expect more from the story as a whole this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched there was no real advancement of anything character development minimal plot advancement maybe enjoyment none im not sure what points were even trying to be made if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys american cia bombs everything that doesnt agree with our opinions all capitalists are corrupt and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death have at for those of us who realize that it doesnt take killing off a good guy to make a point well stick to other movies in summary this was a horrible attempt at an oceans 11 style hidetheplotsopersonhasto think movie because not only do you not know whats going on nobody who made the movie did either home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece
