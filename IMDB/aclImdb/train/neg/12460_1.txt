we gave up at the point where george clooneys character has his fingernails extracted we were not squeamish  having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like to say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to overpraise it how did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseuds corner of a film let alone nominate it for an oscar clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him what was he thinking oh  and what was with those subtitles  did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that  sentences left hanging in midair the film was hard enough to follow without that as well i pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available
