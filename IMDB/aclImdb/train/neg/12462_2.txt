i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this filmbr br i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the rolesbr br for the political buffs and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is awkwardvery boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance feebr br see it if your ready to focus 100 on every minute detail or politics interest you dont see it if you actually like watching films
