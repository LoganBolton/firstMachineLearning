ok hollywood is not liberalbr br obviously im lieing because it is im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie this movie was anti bush anti middle east  anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was badbr br fist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very goodbr br the plot was impossible for me to decode however i have been tested and have an iq of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing whatbr br the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organizedbr br unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going onbr br which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique if you cant dazzle them with brilliance then baffle them with bull s
