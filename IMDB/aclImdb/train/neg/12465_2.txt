exceedingly complicated and drab im a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see whybr br still the sand dunes are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery the cricket is good to seebr br very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over 2 hours long thank heavens they shortened it admittedly we dont get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was 10 times better and i dont really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so theres thatam i nearly there yet br br how about now
