imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and youd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this filmbr br i remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times the story itself isnt too bad its just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain aboutbr br if you dont like america you wont like this film
