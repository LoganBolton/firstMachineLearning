this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen everything about it is weak and incoherent the acting is absurd the costumes even crummier and the story is nonexistent this poverty row sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that beastmaster and conan enjoyed but it doesnt give us any reason to follow along the lead character is tepid and dull he cant even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th century all the action sequences are like that slow and unrealistic not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse dont even bother with this crap
