i saw the mst3k version of deathstalker iii and loved the movie so much  even unmystied  that i decided to watch the entire series of deathstalker films i bought i and ii and settled down for a laughbr br nothing about deathstalker i was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it too much ugliness and nudity i guess either ds 3 was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar ie stupid and carefree and simple i was wrong even at 699 it seemed a waste of money i didnt even open ds 2 as i will return it tomorrow now ill probably just throw away this dvd as i cant return it and no one wants it  including myself so really dont bother with this one even the nudity lots of it btw is uninspiring and icky
