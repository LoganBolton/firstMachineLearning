this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers eating pizza and laugh at unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it so i did and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie isbr br now i love bad movies quite a bit and i probably would have liked this one if the hero wasnt so utterly loathsome the entire movie i was hoping that hed put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him he does very little heroic things in the movie hes a beefy disgusting stupid thing he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do and what was it with all the naked chicks i mean i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy but this movie went a tad overboard in that departmentbr br well anyway if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting hero then im sure youll like this schlock of a film
