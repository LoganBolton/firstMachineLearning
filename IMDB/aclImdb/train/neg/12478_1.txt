i had to give this film a 1 because its that bad but dont make this think that i didnt enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80s style nude scenebattledialoguenude scene and the way that the warriors swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and theres some crappy model effects those arent supposed to be real trees are they and i still dont understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so dont let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons its much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i dont think so rent it and youll see yo
