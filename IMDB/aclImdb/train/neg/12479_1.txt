deathstalker is perfect for bfantasy movie fans this barely 80minute travesty of filmmaking features everything hecklers can ask fornonexistent plotting terrible acting save for at least a raspysounding old lady laughable scripting and schlock editing and bargainbasement style background settings there are no characters that come across as likable or interesting in particular the lead doesnt have anything appealing about him and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the fgrade material if thats not enough then how about the lack of a compelling plot which this movie has nothing of the sort to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey i was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 be topless andor scantily clad 2 get raped 3 have sex with the hero 4 all of the above in addition the background music is hideous a bizarre mess of electronic noise cheesy choral bursts and blaring orchestral cacophony ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested deathstalker is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at and believe me theres plenty of that in here otherwise i do not recommend this 100thgrade conan wannabe to anyone in the least
