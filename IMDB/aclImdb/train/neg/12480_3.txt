or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it james sbardellatis deathstalker of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword  sorcery subgenre has brought along but it is highly amusing the acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldnt be more amateurish but it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilariousbr br  spoilers ahead br br deathstalker rick hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior one day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer munkar obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in munkars possession fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the countys most skilled warriors fight each other until death the winner is then to take the kings place of course the king doesnt want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good kings gorgeous daughter barbi benton from the claws of evil munkar luckily he doesnt get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira lana clarkson in the meantimebr br the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes some of my favorite scenes include br br  deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword the head that falls down however is not that guys head the falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beardbr br  when the character of female warrior kaira lana clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body deathstalkers traveling companion oghris richard brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson even before her facebr br  the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pigbr br  evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingersbr br  there are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eyecandy and although i described this movie as unintentionally funny i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is there is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but i still highly recommend it people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives
