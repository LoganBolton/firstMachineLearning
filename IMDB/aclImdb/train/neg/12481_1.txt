this swordsorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous hero vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles the leering gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause since he is as bad as the people hes fighting zmovie editing is abundant including a scene where a character dies from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completelybr br the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads barbi benton and lana clarkson who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie as a 20something male i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesnt attract me but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless that i couldnt enjoy even this aspect of the moviebr br most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a lighthearted tongueincheek feel the sequel is better in this regard but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy no way avoid at all costsbr br rating 12 out of
