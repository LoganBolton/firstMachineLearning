this films kind of like conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers dont do a good job showing it which is a shame because it could be a decent story richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain  who sadly didnt appear in anything else of note the fight scenes arent too bad either  i love the way deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims  and theres plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br all in all not good  but not necessarily that bad either
