woosh man what can i saybr br the openingscene maybe we see a bunch of mongoloidbarbarians with bad makeup jump off the walls of some ruins they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl the dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it suddenly a blond godlike looking hero with a bad wig appears saying thats my horse the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance the mongoloids arrive deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a swords  sorcery flick so whats with the arribatrompettos and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it she starts liking her lips and caressing deathstalker just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a shortfilmbr br now tell me isnt that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say this is going to be one hell of a good movie the plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalice of magic from the evil sorcerer munkarbr br aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of tts  a shots i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies i could count after 9 points not even halfway into the movie i had to give up counting it was distracting me from the rest of the movie and the rest of the movie was worth it totally crazy stuff check out this mutant catwormlike creature munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers and heres an interesting question what would you do if a man in a womans body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife the answer is simple you slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him then you discover that hes actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room it works out well i tell you deathstalker does it too and the deathstalkerway is the right waybr br deathstalker is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments the villains are vile the women are delicious theres blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken theres a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating slashing and hacking the crap out of each other my favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp and my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the warthoghead reminiscent of the gamorrean guards from return of the jedi i wont reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to ravish in delight when i tell you a 4way dismemberment is thrown into the movies climaxbr br and of course theres a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next pointofview shot shows him being dragged over grass no road see that awesome tattoo on the sorcerers head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right well after all munkar is a magician its that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply dont existbr br as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series i do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass i am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so i could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow deathstalker might be a superbly fun trashy  sleazy conan ripoff it also is an abominable movie
