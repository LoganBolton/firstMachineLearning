this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it it was sort of a remake but then again not really i was very disappointed considering the tools that tim burton has at his disposal he had great make up and cgi available and lots of money 100 million but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million heck no so in that regard the film failsbr br at least in the original film the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming and by the way if you give it some thought and i did you can figure out how the ending could come about i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about itbr br this film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of beneath the planet of the apes heres how i would have written itbr br an astronaut it really should have been more than marky mark because hes not good enough to care a film all by himself so i would have put in three guys that would land on what they would think would be another planet encounter humans not mutes a city ruled by apes were hunted made friends with some good apes discover that theyre on earth via finding some destroyed ruins end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes and thenwell let your imagination run wild on how you want to end itbr br but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film sadly tim burton really knows how to wreck a good thing consider what he did with the batman series hes a rotten director inspite what of people think hes trendy so he must be good goes the thinking sorry but no if anyone else had done this film it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying
