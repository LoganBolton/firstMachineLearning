there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously lowbudget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasnt supposed to be that way there wasnt really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fastforwarded through the last 13 of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a 0 of 10 yikes
