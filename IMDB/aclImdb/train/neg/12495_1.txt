ok i love bad horror i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of demonicus or house of the dead  those were bad enough to make fun of severed was notbr br it was worsebr br spoilers  who caresbr br my friend and i sat through the entire film and i have a number of comments both in the this sucks style and in the realm of actual critiquesbr br plot sort of  theres a guy in this city which is possibly seattle see comment below who is running around and cutting off heads hes been doing this for over a year im not going back to get exact numbers  thank you very much possibly two or three years one head a week and the police are just now calling in a specialist who once refers to himself as a psychic but that never comes up againbr br schya right feds take over after what three connected homicides after nearly a hundred similar killings wed be under freaking martial lawbr br anyway this specialist consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time and the two of them come to the conclusion that its baron samedi a voodoo spirit who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body and then presumably take over the world  or possibly just go to disneylandbr br umbr br setting  where is this happening well if youre not from seattle you might not realize that at the barrave occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members theres a poster for a local radio station and that in the highlyentertaining pulp fictionesqe dialog as if between the two cops yes the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick they discuss the new stadium which may still have been an issue when this movie was madebr br being from seattle i apologize on the movies behalf and hang my head in shamebr br ok heres where it gets really critical  being a horror movie writer not published dont go looking for my name in the imdb i do research lots of research and unlike the writers of this movie i know that baron samedi  while a voudon loa spirit who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated by various christian oppressors with satan  is actually a lokilike trickster god br br in other words he doesnt cut off headsbr br besides a major part of the voudoun religion is that baron samedi can have a body whenever he wants their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loabr br not to mention if hes already possessed someone why make a new bodybr br also if baron samedi got a body he wouldnt go around cutting off heads hed get some good rum and cigars and partaybr br in summary the only thing they did get surprisingly right is that in the completely unnecessary tarot card reading used only to show that the voodoo chick is spooky they didnt screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do again ive done research anyone remember the old latenight ad for phonein tarot readings  the lovers  you will soon fall madly in love and all that nonsensebr br if you made it this far through my comments i congratulate you and im sorry again ill be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me so please dont
