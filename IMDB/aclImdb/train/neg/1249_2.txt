what a disappointment especially in light of the budget provided the technical resources available and the talent assembled isnt the fundamental rule for science fictiondrama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief poa 2001 creates a plausible beginning suckering us in but thereinafter mr burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains the over the top libertarian of helena bonham carters chimp the worthlessness of the humans lockup the ease of their escape their extraordinary skills of horsemanship this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable mark wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down compare to the original in which chuck hestons nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events the uniformed wahlberg preserves his modesty but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation and we never really wonder about his well being unlike heston he seems never to be in real jeopardy tim burton should have used some of the fx budget for some competent screenwriting in fact after this inferior fiasco i wonder why hollywoods producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats let them walk trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in planet of the apes 2001 ill bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent it could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for imagination another opportunity lost
