i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone we can only hope while this remake wasnt a total waste i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original lots of violence and one of the worst endings ive ever seen this version doesnt add anything new it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone
