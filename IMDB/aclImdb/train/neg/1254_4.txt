i have seen and liked the original film and expected more from a remake than thisbr br good effects and makeup are good no complaints about the score and visuals they are adequate and the performances were okay tim roth was excellent the other principals were fine and a handful of the supporting supporting actors did very well with extremely limited roles the action scenes were exciting and funbr br bad the escape from the ape city was terrible the characters are going in circles then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape plus what escape route leads through everybodys bedroombr br the story was pared down to include as much action as possible i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respectbr br finally the ending was completely nonsensical as presented without seeing the inevitable sequel there is no justification for itbr br
