if theres one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film its seeing it done by experienced filmmakers who ought to know better this reimagining of planet of the apes could have used some imagination to say nothing of essential elements of character development nova the girl in the original planet of the apes was a better developed character than daena in this version for all that she does not say a single word one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence wit and humour all of which were notably absent from this productionbr br there were problems in basic plot development the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film even while he was mute his ability to communicate was what marked out hestons taylor as being different from the other humans in the current film mark wahlberg encourages the talking human slaves to revolt but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already they are dexterous toolusers and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans something mute humans cant do it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them indeed since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pretechnology era without at first any gadgets to help him it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage not the humans who are used to living therebr br it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg her best scenes were with the villainous tim rothbr br the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson wahlberg and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gungho freedomfighter this was poor character development estella warren in particular looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script wahlbergs puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughoutbr br creating the apes half a plus point and two minuses ape makeup was excellent on the males particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes which was why he was so good in the green mile and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully but the ape females looked like nothing on earth neither ape nor human the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordons rocket jumping apes looked as if theyd just been fired from a catapult they had none of the longlimbed grace of genuine apes secondly the poor sound mixing  when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal probably feline making them sound ridiculous and unrealisticbr br in the original film the various human things the apes do and say are handled as light relief i never knew an ape i didnt like human see human do here the apes just talk matteroffactly exactly as 21st century humans do and there is no humour in it at all the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feetbr br nothing made me cringe more than the vger from star trek moment near the end of the film first of all the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form secondly the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away something any ape could have done centuries ago this moment was for me far worse than the muchmaligned ending of the moviebr br things of that nature however are typical of most science fiction movies of today back in the 60s and 70s they generally didnt have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional im thinking of 2001 a space odyssey the 1967 planet of the apes thx1138 soylent green silent running and the 1972 solaris the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time however this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich√© going space storms anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes in reality from any one planet all other bodies even their own moons are just points of light a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years twothousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door in a contemporary setting youd have to explain why it was bullet proof but because its science fiction you dont have tobr br overall burtons most disappointing film
