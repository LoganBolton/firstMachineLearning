warning spoilers galorebr br tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho  oh thats right some idiot already did that  i rest my casebr br movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation proving hes not that smart from the outset marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzeesbr br the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason interior of ship abustle with genetic experiments on apes must we travel 1300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments the special effects team decrees itbr br markys chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s scifi cinema  the time warp marky then demonstrates the space stations mindboggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deepspace rescue mission into a wormhole for an expendable test chimp with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen suppliesbr br before anyone can say pointless remake marky has surfed the wormhole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it werent for the kliegs backlighting the plastic treesbr br surprise its apes doing the chasing  or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirtythree years agobr br since marky mark did not get to show his pecs take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap he was characterless michael clarke duncans gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character helena bonhamcarter aka irritating chimp activist at a loss without a shakespearean script did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout paul giamatti the orangutan slave trader secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes reimagining the apes of roth while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke tim roth as chimpanzee thade chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was his character lacked a behavioral arc thade is mad when we first meet him and hes pretty much at the same level of mad at films end nice twistbr br the original pota 1968 featured a leading character charlton hestons taylor who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets  yet as that film progressed taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankinds worth  as their sole champion the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky marks leo or roths thade no but theres lots of runningbr br the slogans cry take back the planet but its the apes planet in this movie humans and apes crashlanded here together the humans having degenerated to cavepeople allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor the apes deserved to inherit the planet along comes marky mark in true anthropocentric arrogance taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators simply because theyre there taking it back is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining a planet where men evolved from apes and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anusesbr br heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was benhur michelangelo moses to cast him as the mute dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audiences expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpantsbr br though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans its like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him burton tries to elevate marky to humanitys icon but he comes off as a chittering deviant in the original film the apes deem taylor a deviant yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity that irony againbr br it was apt that a man who elevated scenechewing to an acting technique  heston  should play the father of this films primo scenechewer thaddeus roth as roths apedad charlton utters his own immortal lines turned against the humans this time damn them damn them all to hellbr br the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end while thaddeus is giving marky an assbeating lesson a pod descends from on high with markys chimpnaut in it apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering lets teach these monkeys about evolution firstly theyre not monkeys you ape secondly it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point not evolution and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy not evolutionbr br giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warrens halfnekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pantsbr br no matter that he was humankinds last underpanted hope in the end cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating its a madhouse a madhouse
