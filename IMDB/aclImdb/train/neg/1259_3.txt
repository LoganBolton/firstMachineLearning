thank you hollywood yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap shallow effectheavy and redundant remake the original planet of the apes was an intelligent and thoughtprovoking movie with a very clear message it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting br br this movie on the other hand seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum character interaction and development are nonexistent and most of the time its extremely hard to figure out whats going on instead we get a bunch of pointless action scenes some marginally funny oneliners and some very hollow quasiintelligent conversations br br the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic the makeup of the apes is magnificent and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too however this does not distract from the fact that planet of the apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie filled with paperthin characters stupid dialogue and a nearly nonexistent plot please hollywood stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbustersbr br oh yeah the ending did not make any sense whatsoeverbr br  out of  stars mainly for the visualsbr br
