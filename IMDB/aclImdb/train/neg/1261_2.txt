im a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i dont think her movies are good and i dont even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast  their performances bring nothing new it always impresses me much to think that harlows beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful
