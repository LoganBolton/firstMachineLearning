this movie doesnt have an awful lot to do with its predecessor robot jox this must be also the reason why its most common name is robot wars and not the alternate name robot jox 2 robot warsbr br robot jox was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isnt very original or cleverly written a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watchbr br just like robot jox this is a bmovie but with as a big difference that its just not a very good one perhaps this also has to with the fact that robot jox got made during the 80s when bmovies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movie got released in 1990 this really cant be said about this movie its just lame badly made poor looking and not exciting enough it also has an ending which leaves you thinking this is it thats allbr br what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plotline really perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story some action or likable main charactersbr br seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if hes gods gift to woman and mr perfect who can compete with anyone werent they even simply able to get the actors from the first moviebr br for such a futuristic movie with a concept of having large battle droids in it this movie surely is lacking with its action had they put some more and bigger action into the movie the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginablebr br you can better watch a mighty morphin power rangers episode for some more action and likabilitybr br 310
