i first didnt want to watch this film for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected filmbut as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard screenwriter of prêtemoi ta main i changed my mind and decided to try it thinking that prêtemoi ta main would be as good as mensonges and it is absolutely not the script is not bad but it is not as well directed as mensonges the actors not as generous especially charlotte as boring as she usually is as edouard baer or clovis cornillac and too be honest i still dont understand how such crap can have such a success even with such a casting anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots but it is not as good as tirards mensonges though its also written by him easy unsurprising and lazy work totally overestimated
