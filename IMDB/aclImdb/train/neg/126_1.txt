i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile it doesnt matter what ones political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc17 that isnt true ive seen rrated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the rrated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia nowhere because they dont exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which were treated to the site of vincent gallos throbbing johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny before crying or implying doublestandard in matters of nudity the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally wont see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica this alleged doublestandard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of womens bodies
