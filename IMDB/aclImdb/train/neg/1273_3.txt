i have two good things to say about this film the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction however that said i found this film extremely tiresome watching paint dry would have been more entertaining it seemed much longer than 97 minutes beginning with opening sequence where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything thats said to him on the phone the movie is annoying the film is filled with clich√©s and shtick not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk also the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears there are some sequences that are touching but theyre all played for laughs if schmaltzy sentimental and cute appeal to you youll love it but if you were hoping for something with more substance see a different movie
