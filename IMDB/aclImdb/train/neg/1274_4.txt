this should have been a movie about sam and his wife the glorious peter falk and equally glorious olympia dukakis that would have been a movie worth seeing instead its a paul reiser vehicle with a little falk thrown in the wonderful elizabeth perkins is also in this movie but youd hardly know it i presume reiser is under the impression that hes a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle hes not even more galling is that reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes but when she does the screen glows the story is about falk and dukakis really but were subjected to a pointless silly preposterous road trip in which reiser gets to show how very cute precious and ohsodeep with psychological insight wrong he can be for instance in a restaurant scene that i imagine reiser had hoped was cassaveteslike theres a laughably false confrontation between reiser and falk that is so patently ridiculous i was embarrassed for falk
