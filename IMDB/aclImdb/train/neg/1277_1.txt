this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it this movie was not just bad as in lowbudget badly acted etc although it certainly was all of those things the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and doing it with great success what i want to know is is this supposed to be a horror movie i mean its definately horrifying but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing but what the hell is the second segment its just annoying the third segment is like watching an artsy student film which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment its an atrocity that this movie isnt way low on the bottom 100 so get your votes 110 in people i know some people gave this good reviews but well theyre lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you trust me it is impossible to like this movie the only benefit of this movie is an amazing lifeextending effect it feels like youve been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed
