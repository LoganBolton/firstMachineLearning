i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereotypical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but ive no idea what jessica lange was thinkingbr br the plot line was good but the execution was just poor im tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didnt speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why theyd like it i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd id say spend your money on something else like a better film
