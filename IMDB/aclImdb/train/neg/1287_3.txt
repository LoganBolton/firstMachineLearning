i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind gettysburg  thats about the length ive come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of itbr br by contrast ang lees film is bloated and uneventful it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasnt a compliment its really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at allbr br the film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are staunch supporters of lincoln and jack an equally staunch southerner whose values jake shares i had to reread that sentence to make sure i hadnt written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become bushwhackers  southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cant even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for sissies im afraid lee lost me right there its easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we arent properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear hes a gormless pimple of a man who isnt a confederate by choice so much as by habit  the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely immitative the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern cavalry appeared on the screen i thought good  kill the rebels end the damned war let me go homebr br aggravating this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent ive heard accents from all over the englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all i dont care if southerners really did talk like that its simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lees picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical sayeverythingthreetimes folksy drawl it would help if they talked faster but not much cant these people find a more efficient language in which to communicatebr br in short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech who dont bathe often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were teased with her body but never actually allowed to gaze upon it which i think is the least we were owed
