this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours someone please tell me what the point wasbr br i mean i understand the historical setting its supposed to be about a ragtag group of confederate bushwhackers terrorists on the missourikansas frontier taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the us civil war but aside from gratuitous violence there wasnt really much of a point to this movie perhaps it was a political statement that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence if that was the point it was done quite well but i dont think that was the point i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot it seemed like i was watching a paperback novel come to life with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novelsbr br this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched
