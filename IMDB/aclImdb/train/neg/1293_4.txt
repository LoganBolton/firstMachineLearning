i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film thought visually stunning like all of ang lees work each still frame seems worthy of a print i was really disappointed by the films disjointed pace it really was too longbr br the story is set in civil war era missouri and is about a young man roedel who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers their union counterparts he and his close friend jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich join the group after chiles father is shot pointblank and his home is burned presumably by jayhawkers the story follows roedels and chiles raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers daniel holt played by jeffery wright and a war widow played by jewelbr br it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped for example the agitation among roedels group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol and then dropped until later in the movie a young villianbully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him but we never know why some of the characters never seem to surface i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of historybr br the historical detail was excellent i loved looking at the housing furniture clothes etc and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters though they stumbled a bit with the dialog unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan though take a pass on this one
