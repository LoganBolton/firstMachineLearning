i basically picked up this movie because i had seen kitano takashis brilliant remake of zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred asano tadanobu these two movies are worlds apart zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clich√©s gojoe goes off the deep end in the other directionbr br first off i hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie you cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in benkeis presence yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself instead of character development we get bloated boring gory battle scenes asanos character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesnt know what he is doing there i know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of asanos appeal but this movie doesnt serve himbr br a lot of the camera movement is nauseating there is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and i felt like vomiting the ending is ridiculous and rather anticlimatic br br its too bad that really good samurai movies arent being made in japan nowadays with this type of budget the colors scenery and costumes were great but the rest is just a loooong waste of time i would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth
