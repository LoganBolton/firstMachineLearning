i am curious is really two films in one  half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with politicalsocialism whatever the directors intention the two dont really mesh together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of politicalwar rallies dr king serious political interviews flopping breasts and pubic hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes youll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nudesexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn im sure there are better choices the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts believably there is little of the overthetopness im so used to seeing in the american films during this time
