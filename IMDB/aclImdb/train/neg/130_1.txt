well where to begin i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaums book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock but dont blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book yeah i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale i mean am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes i certainly didnt expect an hour and fortyfive minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life i certainly didnt expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his offputting glorybr br schneebaum is indeed unlikable the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isnt even that interesting a character to fill a story oh really he was a cannibal ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaums dirty past the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had a small piece thats it folks ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches its like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip unbelievablebr br the directing is indeed superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told alright i understand that i didnt read schneebaums volume before watching his celluloid tale of it but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next hes going on and on about how he cant drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life i mean jesus can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru also i dont particularly care much for schneebaums insipid little quips on life and living but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i dont expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later absurdbr br another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reelsbr br the bottom line here is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud pure and simple i know that i havent read the book but im still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaums work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably unriveting if youre looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious selfserving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straightjacket and a gag
