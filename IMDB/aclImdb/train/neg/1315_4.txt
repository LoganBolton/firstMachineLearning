oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollies new wife and baby the problem is they dont existollie apparently made them up so its up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his familybr br this isnt a particularly unique story idea as ive seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot the best of these was bobby vernons dont kid me it is much better than one too manyprobably much of this was due to it being made a decade laterwhen comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick now i am not against physical comedy but in some slapstick films people starting shooting guns wildly kick and strangle each other etc with little provocation sadly at the end of one too many thats exactly what they do none of it makes sense and it was as if theyd just run out of story ideasbr br overall not exactly a milestone in entertainment theres just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself
