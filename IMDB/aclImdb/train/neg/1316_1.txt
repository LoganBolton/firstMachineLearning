stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive separate film careers before they were eventually teamed for many of ollies prestan films he was billed on screen as babe hardy  and throughout his adult life hardy was known to his friends as babe while touring postwar britain with laurel in a musichall act for bernard delfont hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname early in his acting career hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardys plump cheeks the ones on his face and said nice baby hardys workmates started crying him babe and the nickname stuckbr br although much of hardys prelaurel work is very interesting  notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west  his teamwork with billy ruge who in a series of lowbudget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt names which are unpleasant in their own right but made worse because ruge although shorter than hardy isnt especially a runt seen here hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel  but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustachebr br one too many an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic is direly unfunny  and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as thats my wife one of laurel and hardys most hilarious films plump hardy is the star boarder in a roominghouse run by a tall gawky landlady runt ruge is the porter plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john whose dosh he expects to inherit his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plumps wife and baby theres only one problem plump hasnt got a wife and baby hes been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man now of course plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice of course the results are disastrous it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny but they arent most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubsbr br spoilers coming vim director will louis who shows no instinct for camera framing the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame this could be funny if done on purpose but its merely inept at one point in this bad comedy an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress surely they wouldnt stoop that low for a laugh i thought but they do runt steals the womans black infant and tries to fob this off as plumps progenybr br somehow plump acquires an infants cot but he still hasnt got a baby with uncle john coming up the stairs plump conscripts runt for babyhood this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget or even with a truly runtsized actor such as chester conklin but billy ruge is only slightly below average height ruges impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it amazingly he doesbr br the most notable aspect of one too many is a brief appearance  apparently her onlyever film appearance  by madelyn saloshin oliver hardys first wife the marriage was not a happy one although hardys marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurels br br only one thing in this movie impressed me there is a very brief flashback sequence with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty in 1916 there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks the one shown here is done gracefully and simply too bad this movie has no other merits one too many is definitely one film too many on oliver hardys cv and ill rate this movie just one point out of 10 laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately
