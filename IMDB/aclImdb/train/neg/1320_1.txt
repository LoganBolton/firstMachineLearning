this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting i probably could have written a more exciting plot its a pity that they left it to a pack of howler monkeys alberto tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank god and we too that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living he cant play he cant talk he cant even move very good on mainland without his skis michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and thats all she obviously wasnt chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs nevertheless i must admit that she could be the tombas acting teacher because hes even a worse actor than her and thats funny especially considering that she isnt italian i laughed all the time watching this movie i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh loud very loud
