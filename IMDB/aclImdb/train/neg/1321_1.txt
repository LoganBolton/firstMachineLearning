richard dreyfus is not the star here he has about three 20 second cameos and what is gene barry doing all over this movie no idea the director was probably his brother this is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever the inept writerdirector same dude butchered up everyones talent with his horrendous uhwork i got the dvd for a penny so cant complain but its weirdand it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way this was the 70s and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what its like to be inside his head it has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept but like a scratched record it quickly plays foul it has that manson family on acid vibe to itbr br i have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie maybe they worked in it back when at any rate be prepared to lose 80 min of your life youll never get back yes its that awful
