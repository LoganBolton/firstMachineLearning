richard dreyfuss is indeed in this flick but in a rather small part he is not the obsessed filmmaker  hes the groups business manageraccountant even the box describes the film inaccurately there are no erotic scenes with sondra locke as advertised unless one uses the term erotic quite loosely i would not have considered viewing the film without richard dreyfuss being in it as a major character i might have however had i realized that the famous 60s anthem leonard cohens suzanne was an artistic influence other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of james joyces ulysses and an interesting visual reference to the end of ingmar bergmans the seventh seal i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like last year at marianbad and un chien andalou if you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe there are many superior films ranging from bye bye brasil to cecil b demented
