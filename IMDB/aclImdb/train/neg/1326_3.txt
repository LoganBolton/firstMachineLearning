mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke you have no idea whats happening on the screen with the irritating theme song suzanne being played over and over throughout the movie until when the second coming of suzanne is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thingbr br this offthewall armature movie maker loganjared martin is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside caf√© and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne sandra locke who reminds him of someone he knew in another life jesus christbr br with logans assistant and all around gofer clavius richard dreyfusssomehow getting a 74000000 loan from the bank to finance logans masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon paul sand but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains outbr br the movie also has two somewhat unrelated subplots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy kari avalos whos cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed tofailed its not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there was this supposed to show us in the audience that she like jesus could miraculously heal the sickbr br theres also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair gene barry who seems to be either going through a very difficult midlife crisis or has seen a biblicallike vision that changed his life forever sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what its all about all through the movie and wanted to know why theres all this suffering in the world like this movie that hes in and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david mark rasmusser whos gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coastbr br the movie the second coming of suzanne goes on with a number of unrelated sequences probably to fill or pad in some time by its director and film editor and then goes to its final scene in a christlike crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate on the helpless and tied up suzanne the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2000 years agobr br hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow the second coming of suzanne puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film the movie tries to be arty but thats just an excuse to cover up its brainless and nonexistent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it
