this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a standup and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough  he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his oneliners which by the way arent very funny and seeing him run even back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita  at least by todays standards  doesnt give a very politically correct impression of the japanese dont even get me started about the story i give it a 2 out of 10
