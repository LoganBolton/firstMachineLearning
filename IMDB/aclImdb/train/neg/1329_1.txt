this movie is awful i havent laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time leno shouldve stuck to stand up and late night tv the cars in the movie were cool but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie ive ever seen its pathetic the acting is horrible and the plot couldve been written by a 4 year old dont get me wrong jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie
