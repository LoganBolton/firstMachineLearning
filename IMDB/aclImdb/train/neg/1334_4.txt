so i finally saw the film my left foot last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is the central performance of daylewis is indeed remarkable and amazing but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing lessbr br the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable and disability shouldnt obscure that i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldnt be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable they dont acting out is normal and so yes disabled people act out  but they dont do it because theyre disabled they do it because theyre being unreasonable a physical impairment doesnt afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public just because someone you love turns you downbr br there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or ablebodied giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them admittedly i did once save a penalty from the schools star striker with my face but i already belonged by then it wasnt for acceptance engaging in a bar brawl is another revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after youve proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far all of these things are stupid and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesnt make them any less foolhardybr br so yes just because youve overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesnt make you any less of a jerk being a good person takes priority setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list
