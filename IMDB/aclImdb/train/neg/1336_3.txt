this movie was definitely not one of marykate and ashleys best movies i really didnt like it and i was kind of disappointed in that movie for some reason it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast in some parts it got so boring that i had to fast forward it it didnt have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies
