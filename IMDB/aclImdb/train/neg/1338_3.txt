i saw switching goals twiceand always the same feelingyou see the olsen twins make same moviethey like play different sports and then fall in love to boysok now about the moviefirst off all such little boys and girls dont play on such big goals2football does not play on time outs3if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime a minute or moreand the finish is so foreseeni think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgementif it were done by european producers it would be betterand also the mane actors arent the wright choicethey suffer from lack of authenticok they played some seasons in full house but that doesnt make them big starsyou have got to show your talentand that is what is missing in the olsen twins
