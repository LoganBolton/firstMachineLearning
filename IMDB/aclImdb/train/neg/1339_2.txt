a sad sad sight indeed is the munsters revenge the munsters are brought back one last timefred gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of herman munsterin this madefortv movie about a pair of wax replicas of grandpa and herman that are robots terrorizing the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummys stash at an exhibit with the police on their heels the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names we get to see them dress in drag as waitressesa minor highpoint in the film grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple timesone time even flying to transylvania with herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles i guess and a most annoying relative the phantom constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium what is most sad is hard to pinpoint is it that gywnneespecially and al lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them maybe it is the ridiculous script sid caesars crazy mostly unfunny antics or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super kmart fashion makeover at any even the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for munster standards as for the rest of the cast yvonne de carlo is adequate in a most vacuous rolethough showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience k c martell makes an eversonot affable eddie munster jo mcdonell is an attractive marilyn bob hastings as the aforementioned phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner the film has a real cheap feel about it even for a madefortv movie
