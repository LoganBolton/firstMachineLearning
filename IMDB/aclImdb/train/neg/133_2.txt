well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean havent we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst ive seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst ive seen in the cinema with this onebr br there is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you dont even now who has been killed and who has not and you dont care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviebr br stay as far away from this movie as possible 210
