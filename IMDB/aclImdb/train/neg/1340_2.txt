96 minutes of this is crueland i love the old munsters yes the plot is thing yes the lines are trite but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan there is so much intrigue and i use that word with great pause that i wonder if its an old starsky  hutch episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid60s ludicrous the producers simply replace marilyn  eddie with younger actors why not let them grow and age the addition of an addams family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween partybr br grandpa  herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours preposterous sid ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character i am including the bad robots since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish  yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler and yes it looks like the laugh track is missing in fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later the actors seem to wait on the faux audience its not laughable its sad oh and the best part yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were marilyn says something like where could uncle herman and grandpa be they could have been in an accident they could have been hit by a caror a train lily says responds with something like youre uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track whats amazing about this is yvonne decarlos husband was a stuntman in the early 60s and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt he never recovered and this financially devastated her family check out biographys fantastic review of her life and career this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to herbr br if you are a real fan of the munsters then youll have to rent this mess it illustrates how some things are better left alone even with the nearly original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago
