to be clear from the get go the bagman is very very very bad it suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that its actually hysterically funny to watch this is a very lowgrade film budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence im not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not for example the movie takes place in doomsville note to all prospective home buyers if the town youre moving to is called doomsville keep moving stephanie beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen i couldnt help but laugh because it has intentional humour she turns on the gas stove  get it the sex is that hot get it and unintentional humour the unintentional in this case is the music its like the theme music for chariots of fire goes electronica break out the computer and the synthesizers i realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive i really feel for them because the work here is so wellintentioned the problem is that cheap music isnt necessarily good music i havent laughed so hard at sex on screen since alone in the dark with that seven seconds song i guess they were implying that poor old mr slater was a bit  quick on the draw even the end credits are hilarious intentional or not you be the judge a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast  and an animal wrangler was on set for them  the boom is credited to mr b stick and the 3rd units wardrobe yep they had a third unit is credited to kmart maybe its just me but i think the hilarity of this more than saves the film the movie is very very bad but the goals of stephanie beaton her friends and family are so wellintentioned in the bagman that you cant help but like the movie theyve produced the bagman is bad but not dreadful in its own sweet way it even manages to be a bit endearing it wears its flaws so honestly that you cant help but forgive them better films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way i guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordinglybr br watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this some of them might look cheaper or have worse acting or sillier production value they may not suffer terribly as the bagman does from awful editing sound and foley effects mr b stick didnt do a very good job the special effects look to be where most of the money went they tend to be more funny than gruesome although when the bagman is finally unmasked at the end the makeup job there is surprisingly well donebr br my 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot this is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves bmovie or low budget film aficionados all others should probably avoid with great prejudice
