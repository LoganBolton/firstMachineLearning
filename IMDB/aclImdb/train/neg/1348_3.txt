this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lamethe story is very weakand there is little actionmost of the characters are given little to nothing to dothe movie is mildly entertaining at bestbut really doesnt go any where and is pointlessits watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the 80sits not a movie that bears repeat viewingat least in my mindits only about 74 minutes long including creditsso i guess thats a good thingunlike in the tv showthe characters are not worth rooting for herein the showyou wanted inspector gadget to save the daybut therewho really caresanywaythats just my opinionfor me inspector gadgets last case is a disappointing 310
