this movie in away was superclever its theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway its a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine br br i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off 1prom night 2carrie 3scream 4any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebodybr br i know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldnt grab them as fast as they camebr br valentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a suprise killer people you dont care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil bch then shes an insecure woman and so on and son onbr br normally any horror movie in my book can be saved by gore once again valentine doesnt have this it was as if they tried to make it pg13 but failed so they left the edit br br do not see this overlyinspired ripoff unless you hate yourself and you want to diebr br 12 3 jleonard rollins
