this film essentially deals with inspector gadgets archnemesis doctor claw who has returned after many years to the nowpeaceful city of metropolis claws plan is to foil gadget once and for all by using a newer cooler crimefighter to help destroy gadgets popularity sadly the film fails miserably the series was great but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results without the voice of don adams as inspector gadget it just doesnt cut it anymore dr claw is not only visually less frightening but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold than his original intimidating self granted this is a childrens movie but the plot is so painfully weak heaven forbid i mention the animation that it pales in comparison to the original series someone has decided to updated penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed she now has some quasipunk rebellious clothing style and doesnt play half the role that she did in the tv series the gadgetmobile talks as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire on talking cars maybe im just a kid who loved the show whos grown up jaded but i thought that the liveaction version was more pain than i could bear but now they go and spring this complete wateringdown of the quality tv series on us its more than i can take
