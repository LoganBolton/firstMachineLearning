the bubble is an effort to make a gay romeo  juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian although it seems to come at it by way of friends or beverly hills 90210 the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line the movie seems torn between fluff and depth on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as in one example of many some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand and get answers like hey were here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation dont get political beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line its just one of many hamfisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests on the other hand the movies main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of bent a play about gays in a nazi labor camp the scene on stage is awkwardly rushed undermining its erotic power understandable given the constraints of filmtime but still this could have been edited to much better effect and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film too bad this play deserves much betterbr br the characters are so onedimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire though the word seems inappropriate here substance the aggressive soldier from the crack golani brigade is named golan the militant palestinian is named jihad the strivingforchic faghag roommate is lulu anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in palestine whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as well the rest of this fluffy fantasy when a palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful an ambulance shows up in minutes the outcome of the birth serves to show the palestinians as unappreciative of israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance not the series of bonenumbing soulcrushing humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth death or severe illness ashraf the palestinian lover seems to get through from nablus to tel aviv with no problems no papers no hassles he just shows up whenever he likes when the israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy ricardobr br against the backdrop of nice supportive israelis and surly homophobic palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden loversbr br gay israelipalestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in saleems salaamshalom so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to thinkbr br gloriously bad films  like the works of ed wood  at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them this one doesnt even have that going for it most of the sound track sounds like simon and garfunkel on quaaludes and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre tvmovieoftheweek
