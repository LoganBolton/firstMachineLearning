eytan fox whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics has made several quite interesting films in the past such as walk on water and the simply wonderful film yossi  jagger in the bubble however he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extremebr br far from giving this film a standing ovation the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left i also quietly left fuming with anger at such a ridiculously onesided film that translates selfpreservation as racist bullying and racist bullying and terrorism as outbursts of justified anger which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of onesided israeli aggression against them and that they therefore should not be held responsible for their actionsbr br this film wasnt worth the money i paid for the ticket indeed i considered demanding my money back and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film paradise now if you want to be an antiisraeli then by all means watch this film as it really justifies just such a belief system the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and even worse such a talented israeli director is a crying shame indeed just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such antiisrael propaganda beggars beliefbr br what a shameful horrid little film
