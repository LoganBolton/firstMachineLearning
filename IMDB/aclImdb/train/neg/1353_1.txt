what is it is a mishmash of bizarre recurring motifs snails shirley temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development the whole thing struck me as selfconsciously freak show and i dont mean only the unusual casting decisions it has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter s thompson or william s burroughs the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead my secondleastfavorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but i still found what is it a total waste of my time its one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone elses mind  even someone elses chemically altered consciousness  but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness
