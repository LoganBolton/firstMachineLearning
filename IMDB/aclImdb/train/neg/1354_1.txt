i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film and crispin glovers film is outrageous he basically exploits the mentally challenged not only is shirly temple the antichrist which i admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other but there is an obsession with killing snails crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are mentally challenged peta and human rights should be all over this thing its not counterculture as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival its exploitation
