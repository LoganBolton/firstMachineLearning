i saw crispin glovers what is it at the ann arbor film festival admittedly the film was at least aptly named because i got the distinct sense that even the writerdirector could provide no answer at the question and answer session after the screening mr glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with downsyndrome however this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film actors are in my opinion building blocks for a larger vision  a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worstbr br crispin glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects well he does do that but why the film seems to have no stance no reason for addressing anything does he feel these things shouldnt be taboo the film doesnt even give me an indicator of that taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting it cant even afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he hasnt made the audience care in any way br br ignoring problems with the concept for a moment the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together the editing cinematography and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur glover said 125150 thousand dollars went into the movie and i feel that the money should have been spent on different designers glover actually did some design himself  i know i saw at least sound design in the credits the painted sets are okay not great but used poorly parts feel like a photographed stage play  which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose but in glovers hands it just feels sloppy other parts are filmed like a sort of home movie of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff i see firsttime filmmakers do on imoviebr br perhaps the biggest problem with what is it is i cant even understand how seriously the film is to be taken there are some parts that feel like glover is screaming at you to think seriously at other points he seems off on his own little joke perhaps he meant for this to be ironic or meaningful in some way but i just felt that glover couldnt even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attentionbr br glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film if only it had been at seventytwo minutes the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time
