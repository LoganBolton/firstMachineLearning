i firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a spoof crispin glover is very serious about his film he personally introduced the film at the screening i saw in chicago he had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy what is it is crispin glovers attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by herzog lynch etcbr br i had heard rumor of this film years ago epic porno movie with all downsyndrome cast directed by crispin glover when it finally came out i watched the trailer online and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation i went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment if he took out the goofy sht such as the potsmoking grandma and the dancing dolls he would be left with something much better but only about 10 minutes longbr br in other words just watch the trailer be entertained and leave it at that there are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment
