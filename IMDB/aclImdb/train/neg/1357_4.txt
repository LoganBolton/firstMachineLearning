may contain a spoiler of sorts the mere mention of crispin glover is enough to send some geeks panties in a bunch his landmark appearance in back to the future as george mcfly has sealed him into the american conscience forever more recently he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with bartleby and willardbr br this time however crispin has made a 76minute cheap dada film at times it reminded me of genius while overall it almost insulted me but not because of its content content what is it is a movie where in one half of the movie all of the actors have downs syndrome giving it a freakshow feel to it the other half of the movie includes crispin glover adam parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy this all had the feel of what john waters was attempting to do with desperate living and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserablybr br the half with the downs syndrome actors also features many many killed snails it is about a guy who has snails and ends up killing one he is also tormented by a bunch of other people and a grasshopper he falls in love with 2 girls one of which he has sex with in a graveyard he also has a falling out with a friend who teases himbr br in a weird semiinterior set crispin glover is the director of this show he is something like the control of the guys mind and the cerebral palsy guy is something like the sexuality well he at least gets masturbated in explicit scenes there is other shocking imagery made humorous like nazi swaztikas crossed with shirley temple and minstrels in black face saying theyre michael jacksonbr br in the outside world the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by the other people they beat him with rocks and such later they beat the minstrel after putting him on trialbr br back to the interior crispin glover is still the ruler of his set and tries to control everybody but fails miserablybr br what is it makes less sense than dr caligari and has more than a passing style stolen from it the claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way the nowall sets of dr caligari felt claustrophobic they also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense and it was all wrapped up with absurdist imagery for humorbr br the problem is about 20 minutes into the moviemaybe a little morewhat is it runs out of imagery for the next 56 minutes we keep running on the same sets of images only introducing new imagery in the form of an absurdist puppet show the movie seems little more than a movie which attempts to push the envelope in offensive and taboo imagery it tries to mock and confuse the audience but the issue is that it only has enough different imagery for a 40 minute moviebr br even worse than that the cinematography set design and everything else felt very very cheap and almost unplanned it felt like ok this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way it didnt feel interesting and was quiteboring dr caligari on the other hand had amazing cinematography and framing the difference between the two is quite astoundingbr br rating c
