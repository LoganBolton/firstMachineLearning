maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at allbr br the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for embezzling he convinces robert morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob newhart another unusual duo for filmsbr br morley sounds just as he did in 1938s marie antoinette perhaps he needed to return to that genrebr br this film is ridiculous at best hard to believe that the following year maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in the prime of miss jean brodiebr br ms smith is made out here to be an apparent dumbred head but by films end she is the brains of the outfit too bad the writing didnt go the way with her
