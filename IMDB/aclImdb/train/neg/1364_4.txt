the more i think about it there was nothing redeeming about thisbr br movie i saw it 9 months ago so my memory might have made itbr br worse than it was but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out ofbr br 10 br br after seeing the movie i met the director he seemed so cluelessbr br as to what he was doing or what he had done and as far as ibr br could tell he didnt care for the film either even he agreed that hebr br didnt really know what he was doing and he was forced to dobr br certain things because it was filmed digitally br br i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that itbr br built for itself 9 people all have to be connected in some way howbr br can we get from point a to point b so in order get from thebr br prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10br br minutes on each characters relationship to another person itbr br makes one feel choked by the 2 demensional badly drawnbr br charactersbr br i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie stevebr br bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing thats it as ibr br say 4 out of 10
