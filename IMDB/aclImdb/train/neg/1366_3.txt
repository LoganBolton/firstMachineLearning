 contains spoilers  br br the truly exquisite sean young who in some scenes with her hair poofed up looks something like elizabeth taylor is striking in her opening moments in this film sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust her face and body are tense and distracted unfortunately once the bust is over youngs strained demeanor never changes this is one fatally inhibited actressbr br one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend arnetia walker to grasp what is missing in young walker is open emotional and at ease at all timesin that theres no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it she is an open book young on the other hand acts in the skittish selfconscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film basically she doesnt have a cluebr br with this major void looming at the center of the movie were left to ponder the implausiblities of the story for instance after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal shes trailing and locked in a closet she breaks the door down when left alone granted shes dressed only in a bra and panties but in a similar situation with a psycho captor due to return any moment would you head for the dooror take the time to go through his dresser take out some clothes and get dressed i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss youngs character is experiencing but young can not convey this type of complexitybr br there are a few affecting moments in the film such as the short police interviews with the criminals past victims but overall this is an aimless endeavor its too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor batman and dick tracy because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching watching miss young try to act at least in this thriller is a sad spectacle
