 warning here be spoilers  why do i waste my hastily fleeing years watching garbage like this this film is an impressive collection of clich√©s poor writing worse directing and then we havent even got to the acting yet br br and of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to endbr br hero expert fights against stupid corrupt and incompetent henchmen one avalanche goes off burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger perils corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money second avalanche heroically deflected by renegade experts adventurous experiment evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well troubled teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her etc etc etc etc on and on it goes br br in fact theres little reason to warn for spoilers you could probably work the whole plot out if i gave you the basic ingredients at least i wasnt too wide off the mark most of the time anticipating what would happen nextbr br and then we havent discussed the factual errorsbr br i agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually some redeeming features even of a bad movie youd be hard pressed to find any in this one i suppose i gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots but thats itbr br its been some time since a film made me groan but this one certainly did
