its like a bad 80s tv show got loose and tried to become a softcore porn movie oh my god was it bad the plots of each character had little relevance the plot itself wasnt anything to speak of something about a stalker i guess in the end he shoots himself its not really clear but somehow theres a volleyball game involved and the main character randy sleeps around a lot the only reason my friends rented this movie was because casper van dien was in it and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it which were barely watchable at that thank god i didnt spend any money on it but i want that hour of my life back
