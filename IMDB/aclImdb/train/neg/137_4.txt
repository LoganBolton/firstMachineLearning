its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these teen slasher movies they are so unbelievably formulaic and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier im sure they would have been spoofing this film too  thats if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams i know what you did last summers and urban legendsbr br valentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than usual ending which of course leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel as always a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women killing the main characters friends one by one in typically over the top style lots of ta on display no character development bad acting and overly elaborate bloodshedbr br the thing i cant stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as who done its the thing is that they arent because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked and tells the main character whos friends have now all been murdered usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway eg main characters mothers uncles fishing partner kicked his friends fathers dog everybody still left alive throughout the film is a suspect but they are more red herrings than suspects as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealedbr br valentine followed this formula almost to the letter spoiler mini spoiler anyway in valentine the motive was not revealed but more left for you to think about given that the film didnt quite conclude in the typical teen slash way the issue is only part resolved and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody will the killer want more or were the demons truly vanquishedbr br this still didnt make valentine a good film instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual which still doesnt count for much to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines please dont originality is so important and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre
