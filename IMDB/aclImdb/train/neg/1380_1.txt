this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film its great to see jbeals but shes only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cant get work doesnt feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the 90s  and not even a good one in those standardsbr br
