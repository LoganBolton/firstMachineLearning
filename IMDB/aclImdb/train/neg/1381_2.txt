mild spoilers contained herein im spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it br br jet lis movies fall into one of two categories shaolin period movies and movies set in modernday hong kong revolving around triads or triad like organizations each genre has its best and worst films twin warriors is jet lis best shaolin era flick while the evil cult is his worst fist of legend while in the recent past is the best modern era jet li movie black mask without a doubt is the worstbr br jet li plays a selfexiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his life span in his new life in exile he plays a pacifist librarian when his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage jet li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them he dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police and public as a librarian as well as to conceal his true identity to his excomrades in armsbr br the version i saw was dubbed and horribly at that why does jet li capture and hold hostage his library coworker if hes a pacifist is there a love story between them why does the police chief not care when he learns of the black masks true identity the plot is just plain bad bad by way of the superhero cheesiness bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed bad in its character interactions all topped off by a halfexplained story i quickly lost interest in br br the action and martial arts sequences are way over the top lots of blood gore severed body parts aplenty explosions and matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point if you want to see jet li playing a vigilante superhero in a mission impossible style movie black mask delivers for the rest of us jet li fans it is a true disappointment this is one of those movies where jet li never gets to be jet li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability br br normally a chinese knockoff of ozzy osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film sadly black mask proved to be an exception to that rule indeed the antagonist of this movie by the way he dresses his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged ozzy osbourne however the villain isnt onscreen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile i am assuming the likeness to ozzy was intentional in addition to the villains look he also ran a satanic looking hideout so much more could have been made from the ozzy osbourne villain gimmick if only the writer director or anyone had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the films arch villainbr br black mask was the first jet li film released on video in the usa after lethal weapon 4 and im glad i stayed away from it until now it may well have ruined my whole perception of jet li as a martial artist and actor if you want to see jet li at his worst rent black mask and the evil cult and make it a double feature or horror both intentional and unintentional otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of jet li and have plots that are semiwell thought out and plausible 39 stars
