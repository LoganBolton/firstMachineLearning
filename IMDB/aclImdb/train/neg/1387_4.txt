its hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was transcendant trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent br br its a comic book story about a group of superhuman soldiers who are to be killed because theyre mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li sheds his new life to save the worldbr br the version i saw was dubbed and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the waferthin plot and comicbook 25 cent special effects but i suspect even ninjaturtlewatching 8year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow
