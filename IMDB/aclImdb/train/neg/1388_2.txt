went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4 unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldnt see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicksbr br too cartoonish and very disappointing
