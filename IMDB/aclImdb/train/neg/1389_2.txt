i was very disappointed in this movie plotwise it was weak bordering on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members and the whole bstory with the holobrothel and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television why are you wasting my time with thisbr br thematically river of souls didnt really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still dont get a feeling for their culture are there any female soul huntersbr br the acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects  especially the planetscapes in the first act  were very impressive but overall id say give this one a miss
