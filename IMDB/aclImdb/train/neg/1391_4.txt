before this made for tv movie began i had relatively low expectations thats because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone there is no president sheridan delenn lennier londo vir gkar or lyta if you remember on the second to last episode of the series all the regulars except zack vir and captain lockley left b5 permanently now for this film they did bring back garibaldi who was not in the last b5 movie to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance but because so much is gone of the old chemistry this film already is severely handicappedbr br the movie is about a soul hunter martin sheen who is led to babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist ian mcshane a lot of spooky mumbojumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless yeah yeah the station nearly blew up but was saved and all but frankly i felt like it was a case of been there done thatand done that a lot better in the pastbr br the secondary plot provided more for comic relief was much more interesting as an entrepreneur installed a holobrothel and those in command werent sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close they were slapped with a lawsuit this was fluff but it did provide a few laughssomething the other dreary plot was surely lackingbr br by the way sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunterwith his wild eyes and bizarre delivery however repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character this should have been spotted and correctedbr br so the final verdict is this is only for total diehard b5 nuts like myself others seeing it might assume the series suckedwhich is a great injustice this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit
