this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie but for me it failed i wont elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line but if you are looking for a detailed explanation the comment by user reluctantpopstar gives a good description of itbr br but it didnt work for me i found it slow which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this moviein some films one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason i dont think that this is the case herebr br as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other usersi see that they do have a pointthey give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the action and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one
