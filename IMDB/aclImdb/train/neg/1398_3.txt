i bought this it was only 3 ok under the title grey matter the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a nondukesofhazzard role intrigued me as the other reviewers warned its a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awrybr br and yes there are plenty of establishing shots especially of a house with a pool in front of it some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings its actually kinda funny after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channels station identification logo reminding us that we are watching grey matterbr br i also enjoyed two bouts of namecalling at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a scientific btch its just a very inadequate insult several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that scientific btard it just sounded very awkward to mebr br someday this movie will disappear forever another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it almost like it never happenedbr br
