ouch what a painfully boring scifi movie and thats especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so actionpacked and full of potential during the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of topsecret files as hes about to reveal the supposedly horrible  inhuman events that take place in the lab hes executed figuresÂ… from then on the action swifts back and forth between two locations the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator or something and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing more like dull pointless and vague scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and its really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds anyway they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanitythreatening device perhaps i missed something but i doubt it the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow as really none of them have personalities so basically the brain machine just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it werent for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a fivesecond shot of the places either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all scifi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying i assure you james bests performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent but one man definitely cant save this thing from being an absolute waste of time avoid
