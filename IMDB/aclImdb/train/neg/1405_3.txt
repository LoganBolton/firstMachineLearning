a damsel in distress is definitely not one of fred astaires better musicals but even astaires bad films always had some good momentsbr br in damsel astaire is jerry halliday an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour he meets lady alice marshmorton 19yearold joan fontaine a beautiful english heiress who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirersbr br jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt he tries to rescue her from her familys country manor house but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry keggs reginald gardiner the conniving butler and albert harry watson the bratty house boy each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alices romance with jerry to make sure they win the betbr br this musical has numerous problems first there is the plot based on a novel by pg wodehouse who cowrote the screenplay the story is slow painful and nervegrating when fred is not dancing we have to endure endless annoying scenes of a fred romancing joan fontaine or b keggs and albert conniving against them and each otherbr br the butler and the house boy are especially irritating they are onedimensional stock villain characters the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dancebr br astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner ginger rogers joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film and is miscast in a musical she has little going for her characterwise other than her lovely face and beautiful smilebr br george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride as jerrys publicist and his ditzy secretary the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot and gracie has some funny lines but she is also very annoying at timesbr br the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done at times the cinematography is horrible and offfocus there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets to try to convince the audience that we are in london not hollywood they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie on the plus side the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific and have become classic song standards and of course the dancing in the movie is exceptional thanks to astaire and his choreographer hermes panbr br but the musical and dance numbers are illused and illstaged at times the cast seems to start singing and dancing because well its time for them to start singing and dancing the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot at one point the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason the numbers include  im dancing and i cant be bothered now  fred dances well on a foggy trafficfilled london street he does some great canetwirling with a rolled umbrella  but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing doubledecker bus in the broadway musical crazy for you harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girlsbr br  put me to the test  fred george and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage george and gracie match fred step for step but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reasonbr br  stiff upper lip the fun house number  at an amusement park fun house fred george and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor rotating barrel and with the fun house mirrors its the best number of the movie but it gets a little repetitious at timesbr br  things are looking up  fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate fortunately its a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancerbr br  a foggy day in london town  fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london at times he looks as if hes not sure which way hes going in the fog  much like the musical number itselfbr br  nice work if you can get it  a great song that is misused in the movie during a social event at the manor house fred gets drawn into a chorus of dourfaced singers who are haphazardly singing this song each time fred joins in the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave again harry groener did a better dance number with this song in crazy for you  drum dance number  as fred and joan are eloping fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums as usual its a great dance number but theres absolutely no need for it except to prolong the moviebr br the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine as he leaps from the balcony he finds a convenientlyplaced trapeze  thats right a trapeze  hanging from a nearby tree fred or rather a stuntman in freds clothes grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from itbr br the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote the ff button allows you to skip through the other boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers
