i did not expect a lot from this movie after the terrible life is a miracle it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than life  i have impression that directorwriter is just joking with the audience  let me see how much emptiness can you audience sustain dialogues are empty  scenario is minimalistic in few moments photography is really nice few sarcastic lines are semifunny but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this comedy ive laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end if you can lift yourself above this directors fiasco  you will find good acting of few legends miki manojlovic aleksandar bercek and very good performance of emirs son stribor kusturicabr br in short too bad for such a great director  emir kusturica is still young and should be making toprated movies instead he chooses to do this lowbudget justformyprivate theater movie with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans
