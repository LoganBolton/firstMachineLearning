not really spoilers in my opinion but i wanted to cover myself nevertheless as the executive producer morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less a movie with an intentional indiefeel and just be absorbed in the mentorbeallthatyoucanbe theme he plays a alternate universe semiwashed up version of the real morgan freeman who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson ca from brentwood to research his next movie role why carson is a mystery to so cal residents he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements paz vega is pretty to watch a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freemans research his character is only known as him to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average peoplepsst thats him etc unfortunately i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood carried no cash or debit card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has nothing really happens in this movie i dont believe that either of the main characters were substantially changed by their encounter with each other it flirts with the idea of adultery but then that thought fizzles this to me was similar to steve martins shopgirl without the sexual affair it was selfindulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience
