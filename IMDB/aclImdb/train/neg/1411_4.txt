this movie was great the first time i saw it when it was called lost in translation but somehow bill murray turned into an eccentric black man played by morgan freeman scarlett johansson turned into a cranky latino woman played by paz vega and tokyo japan turned into carson california instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in translation we get meaningless blabbering in 10 items that verges on annoying instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in translation we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about how can a character that wears hundred dollar tshirts and has never been inside a target department store expect to give advice to a workingclass woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant dont think that stops him if he isnt giving her clothing advice hes telling her what she should eat the most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand be it washing the car stopping at arbys or just laying around to list off their 10 items or less lists of things they love and hate i kept wanting to yell at them saying didnt you say you had somewhere to be what the heck are doing a minute ago you were practically late now youre eating roast beef and pondering your lives until i saw this movie i never truly understood how something could insist upon itself but i think this movie does exactly that and undeservedly so the dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympatheticÂ…with the exception that i felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project
