i love morgan freeman paz vega is an attractive appealing and talented actress im sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it nothing does its short less than 90 minutes it was 75 minutes too long after an hour of frustration i scanned through the remaining 20odd minutes excruciatingbr br freeman plays an actor  who hasnt worked in a while  researching a part that he might play as a checkout clerk in a supermarket he visits the supermarket where she works nothing happens she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an arbys a target a car wash nothing happens they converse about their lives nothing happens everbr br i dont get it but i also dont get the bill murray flicks lost in translation and broken flowers if you like those movies maybe youll like this lots of people find movies like this whimsical charming or  for reasons that escape me  find the dialog fascinating a common device in movies of this ilk is to have a long take of stillnesssilence after an actor delivers a line thats supposed to be meaningful we know its meaningful because its followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen sorry i must be a philistine i dont get it to me these kinds of movies arent funny or charming or thoughtprovoking theyre just boring why because theres no comedy no drama no tension no laughs no suspense no action nothing to watch in short none of the things i go to the movies for i can be bored for free i see oddballquirky characters in real life i go to target and fastfood restaurants and carwashes these elements do not a movie make even if stars are doing this stuff i pay to be entertainedbr br if youre crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing have fun if you wanna drool over paz vega you can look and listen to her but nothing happens i promise a total snoozefest
