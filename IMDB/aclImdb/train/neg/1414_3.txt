after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers pointbr br this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different 10 items rushes the viewer through the 1day time line of the movie whereas the betterplanned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long daysbr br im sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles nowadays are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub10mil limited release movies and indie films
