i had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews thenbr br heres my additional two cents to the already posted excellent lost in translation review premise morgan is stuck in a dusty small town where he meets lovely scarlet who is working in the local supermarket can morgan help elevate the lovely scarlet from her trailer trash lifebr br realistic dialog not how about that shopping in target first freeman looks at the target interior as if hes walked into harrods then hes bowled over at a tshirt rack confirming he has never been in any store visited by lovely scarlet morgan is detached from any and all aspects of scarlets reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in scarlets lifebr br one reviewer enjoyed the scarlet and exhubby fight scene where her survival a car in this instance requires she physically attack her ex hubbie does freeman run to her defensenawhes cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real sorry lot in life br br freemans character believes a car wash and new very revealing tight fitting blouse is the key to scarlets job interview another sign that freeman is clueless freemans endless stage talk where all aspects of scarlets reality are reduced to one or another stage related freeman experience was irritating br br freeman is right to emphasize that scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis uneducated no white collar skills or experience very poor no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem scarlet learns such life lessons from freeman as some people pay 100 for a tshirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills in the end freeman offers scarlet little more than strange diversion with a starnot even paying for gas for scarlets dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which freeman cares not to know
