strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but didnt like this one at all its awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew  like saving the movie lol  its also filled with overused clich√©s of characters and situations i dont get it why people liked it poetry hope nope mam didnt see anything like that  all in all its empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one
