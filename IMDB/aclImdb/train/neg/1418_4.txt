i dont know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of 57 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all thank god we have laws against this kind of material nowbr br this is one short from the shirley temple festival
