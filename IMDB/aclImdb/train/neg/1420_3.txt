i saw this movie once late on a public tv station so i dont know if its on video or notbr br this is one of the baby burlesks sic that shirley temple did in the early 1930s it is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of kiddie pornbr br shirley temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of 5 they are all in diapers and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol the cash is in the form of lollipopsbr br shirley playing a femme fatale sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her  but shirley doesnt need really their lollipopscash because her purse is full of ones from other menbr br meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table br br what a strange film    infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon who thought up this stuff any way
