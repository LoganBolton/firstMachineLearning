i rented the dubbedenglish version of lensman hoping that since it came from wellknown novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didnt rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasnt much therebr br i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly dramatized or otherwise deficient some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the star wars image of hyperspace the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized r2d2br br it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesnt work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense its superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to jarjars annoying sillinessbr br the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field dumping silage onto unharvested crops rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto alreadyharvested rows or into a truck corn maize was pouring out the grain chute but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat fieldbr br when it was time for kims father had to face his fate there wasnt any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the englishlanguage voice actor but the drawings didnt show much weight either kims reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincingbr br similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close hendersons death is no spoiler his name isnt revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someones expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case theres at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chrisbr br on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths i cant say whether thats lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source  possibly the lensman booksbr br theres a scene where a space ship crashlands as it plunges toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it landsbr br while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero theres a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over hendersons death so quickly should at least be able to shout help its got me and i cant reach my gun instead of just shriekingbr br the character with the most personality almost too much at times is dj bill he sounded like wolfman jack the dj in american graffiti i wonder if hes as wellvoiced in the original languagebr br two planets in the movie exploded the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death stars primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the planetary explosionsbr br some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from tron is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that emphasizes the cheesysounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesylooking computer graphicsbr br finally theres the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a na√Øve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and acquires a great power he doesnt understand he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful unredeemably evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is persistent and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but theres very little more than that in this moviebr br in the end its just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesnt need to be anything more than that
