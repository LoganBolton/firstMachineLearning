the original lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre its pure adventure sf with some substance here and there and ive always wondered why hollywood hasnt filmed it verbatim because its just the kind of thing they love massive explosions superweapons uberheroics hero gets the girl aliens great cgi potential good versus evil in the purest form etc etc instead and bear in mind im a japanophile and anime lover we get this horrendous kiddies movie that rips the guts out of the story mixes in starwars ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally pastiches and dumbs the whole thing down to thundercats level to see kimball kinnison the epitome of the galactic patrol officer and second stage lensman portrayed as a small boy is pitiful etc i just cant understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money far by telling straight it makes no sense
