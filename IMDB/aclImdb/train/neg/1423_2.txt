wow watching this film today you cant help but be appalled by the writing of this film spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who in modern times might be featured on the jerry springer showas they have a sick and abusive relationshipand inexplicably the writers appear to be endorsing it br br the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful spencer tracy he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay its never clear whether or not they marryand considering its a precode film you can assume they arent even though they are cohabiting their relationship is very strangeand rather sick while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions he is verbally abusive and a total jerkand young comes running back for more like some sort of dog he calls her skinny or ugly and these are in a sick way his way of using endearments later when he starts fooling around with another woman glenda farrell she tells her friend that if thats what he wants its okay with her it sure smacks of a sadomasochistic relationship and you cant help but feel a bit horrified sure he doesnt hit her but the relationship is very abusive to show how sick it is when young gets pregnant she tells him its your baby and its mine but you dont need to worry ill take all the blame for it yikes doesnt this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home later in a case of art imitating life tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears after all he cant be burdened with a babyeven if its his but he changes his mind and decides to return home wowthats bit of him and when he returns hes nasty and acts like if he stays he isnt obligated to care for the kid and she tells him hes a free manfree as a bird wow i was almost in tears at this tender momentnot soon this crazy pair are marriedand naturally young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits himnot because of any love or sense of responsibility so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters what would you do well as for the writers they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat the romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least during the robbery tracy behaves like a chumpdoing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caughtlike he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison and to show what sort of nice guy he is the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friendsbr br while theres more to the film the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film despite both being very good actors theres absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced nice music nice sets good actingand a script that is 100 poo how the film is currently rated 74 is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters a horrible misfire that somehow didnt destroy the careers of those involvedbr br oh and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong the answer is no by the end shes learned nothing and hasnt changed one whit for the betterbr br they sure dont make films like they used toand in this casethank god
