one question why first off the premise is not funny or engaging at all they use taped interviews and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts first off the interviews arent funny or entertaining to begin with and even if they were i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally without being turned into cartoons how does that add any hilarity to it i turned on cbss monday night sitcom lineup which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful monday workdays and found this on of course the sitcom lineup would be reruns anyway being summer but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining i tried to give cc a chance i really did when it started i figured well maybe it will be funny nope and then it kept going it was a long half hourbr br and i can almost see if there was a purpose if the interviews were shown in their entirety and had points to them but no it was just oneline clips cut and pasted together really quick it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon networks robot chicken i wasnt a fan of cbs nowcancelled sitcom the class while that was on it was one halfhour of the lineup i would struggle through but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of creatureslets just say id take the class considering its been a couple hours since it aired and i come on here to see i am the first to commenti guess thats a good sign that nobody watched it and that it wont last much longer cartoon roadkill
