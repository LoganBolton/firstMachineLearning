the british claymation series putting witty conversations taped from average people in the mouths of cute fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for nonbritish viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldnt get on us television someone made the mistake of putting it on us televisionbr br sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime britcom coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didnt translate from british english to american english what seemed droll and cultured and just a bit dull in england comes across in creature comforts the american version as simply boredom with puppets theres no through plotline no characters and after one and a half episodes watched of the three ultimately aired no reason to suffer through morebr br the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a setup for the single worst show on the cbs schedule the new adventures of old christine or how to be a horrible mother  or person  in one interminable unfunny lesson kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show and the adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when two and a half men guilty pleasure and how i met your mother actual quality writing come on
