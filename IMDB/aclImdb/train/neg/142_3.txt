firstly there are some good things about this film but its all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that ive seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but shes a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and whats with that look she gives everyone perhaps its part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book its based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time ill read the book to find out rather than watch this
