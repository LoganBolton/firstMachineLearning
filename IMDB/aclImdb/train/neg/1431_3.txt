 possible spoiler br br youd think a story involving archie grey owl  an englishman posing as a red indian  would have a massive amount of humour involved  in fact id say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy  however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama  worse  hes made an extremely dire film too  pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony  played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau  lacks any type of on screen chemistry  but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing hes a native american  the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman  thats why i wrote  possible spoiler  its not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english  but its obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence theres absolutely no surprise involvedbr br yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isnt actually a new concept  theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told  and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green  and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message  that there hasnt actually been a great ecological film  in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl  a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
