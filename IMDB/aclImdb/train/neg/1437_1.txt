i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but dont think watching it from the beginning wouldve made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors roy marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind solomons minesthe very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a preschool kid wouldve been spellbound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day
