this is the worst imaginable crap the novel by h rider haggard is very entertaining and dramatic the makers of this worthless movie dont follow it closely well old novels arent sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of ones own if all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watereddown clich√©s one should stick to the original if they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard but theres no imagination at all only tiredness this should be bought or watched only by collectors of victorian novels made into moviesbr br just a hint and not a spoiler i think to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on tv or  god forbid  waste money on buying this gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to gollum has been turned into a nice gal
