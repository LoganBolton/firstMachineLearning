the movie is an extralong tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventures spirit the quite horribly american patrick swayze is cast as the british hero allan quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationalitybr br the movie continues throughout to hollywoodise the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold the movie manages to be predictable throughout even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequencesbr br all in all a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king solomans mines and allan quatermain
