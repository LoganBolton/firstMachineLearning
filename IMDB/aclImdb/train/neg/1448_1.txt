having grown up in texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be gilleys i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking honkytonkin rednecks the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas twang to most texans accents but these people overdo it you cant get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents it just doesnt work john travolta should have stuck to discodancing or the 50s debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan
