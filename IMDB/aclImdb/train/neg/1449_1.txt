first before reading further you must understand that im not neonazi im just trying to understand correctly hitler to be sure nobody like him take power againbr br ive seen this series and found it awful i mean ok its interesting to look but is it real i searched for answers and found one absolutely not first hitler wasnt angry all his life the series shows an angry hitler even when he is a child second hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter in fact it is highly probable that hitler in reality was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret third people will hate me but its true hitler was charming how do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly because he was charming thats a common point i found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him of course not jewsbr br this series was awful because if you think that hitler was just an angry bastard ugly and of course not charming at all youre wrong if you think that you will let people like him take power in countries and you dont want that if you really understand how hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking he was just awful youll be able to find dangerous politicians like him of course remember he was elected and stop theme before its too latebr br life is important to protect this series is just awful to show us the truth if we continue to see hitler like that another one will take place exactly as the first did
