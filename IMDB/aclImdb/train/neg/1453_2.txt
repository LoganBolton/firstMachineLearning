im not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fakebr br after seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment theres no connection between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldnt even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potentialbr br and above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when hes speakingyelling germanbr br the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happenedbr br whether its the english or the fact that ive already seen der untergang everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous
