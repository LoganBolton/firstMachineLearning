the back cover of the dvd missed this one when it came out hails hitler the rise of evil as a triumph the new york post and mesmerizing newsweekbr br wellnever mind the post but really who ever wrote that word in newsweek in the same context with this peace of ahem art should be sackedbr br i dont no where to start with why try to paint the picture of hitlers evil with colors that did not exist he was evil alright but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate compared to his love of animals the gentle and subdued way he treated women and so onbr br the actors are good so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their onedimensional characters some kind of curse here with peter o toole this is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie or in this case tvproduction to be accurate the first one was of course the legendary galigulabr br the list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by imdb so i think ill leave it herebr br this one is ok if its on telly and you dont have anything else to do but believe me  its best left on the shelf in your local virgin store
