there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i dont know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming youre a super crimefighting valentinebr br valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nighinvulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind the score is more overbearing than norman bates motherbr br the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentines day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspectbr br heres problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds dont turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds hes not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch is especially exploited most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a valentines day party just because its february doesnt mean you might not feel like taking a little dipbr br the slasher in valentine dresses in headtotoe black with a cherubs mask heres problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone whos whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple its not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands br br not only is the movie bad it isnt even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than hah when youre not scratching your head youre yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if youre alone on valentines day find something anything else to do youll be glad you did
