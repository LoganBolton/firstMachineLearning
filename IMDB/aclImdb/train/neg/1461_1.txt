i saw that movie and i was shocked robert carlyle isnt hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be hitler the movie lies it doesnt reflect the truth in the scene were hitler hit the guy with his gun hitler never had hit anybody he wouldnt hit people with his fist but with the fists of soldiers understand another thing is it is too obvious that hitler is that evil he was more clever than shown in this movie no german would have accepted him as the leader because the can see that he is evil so the real hitler havent shown his evil side to the peoplebr br have any of you yankees watched the movie der untergang or the dawnfall this is a great movie with amazing actors and its a german movie i think this theme of nazigermany should not be realized as a movie by people who dont know anything of germany people watch der untergang br br httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0363163br br its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world
