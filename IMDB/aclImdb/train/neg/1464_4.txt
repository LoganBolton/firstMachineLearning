i watched this hoping to find out something i didnt know about modern historys most infamous man and couldnt help thinking that history has been rewritten in hitlerthe rise of evil  hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirers shot  hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest ernst rohm  forgive me for asking but havent the writers confused adolph hitler with tony montana from scarface  thats bad enough but what really offended me was that theres entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series  germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made germany pay a heavy price for doing so it was this economic environment that led the german people to have someone  anyone  to restore their pride and thats why they turned to nazism  the german humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that hitlerthe rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document and i havent even mentioned that himmler and goering are conspicous by their absence br br there is one positive point about the mini series and thats robert carlyle in the title role  okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud  archive recordings show that hitler had a soft seductive voice  but carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate hitlers own charisma on screen  comments in the british press that carlyle resembles the synth player from sparks more than adolph hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of hitlerbr br i liked the performance by robert carlyle but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place  theres nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
