well first off id like to add that i myself is somewhat of a historian so what i look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts but this is however not the case here sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isnt entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying hitler wasnt antisemitic in his youth he even worked for jews before world war one it was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the jews his upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate hitler as a child wasnt a disturbed little brat he had a more or less normal upbringing nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is hitlerbr br robert carlyle is a great actor but he doesnt really fit in the role as hitler hitler wasnt as impossible and unstable as he is portraited here under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom manipulated people through his charms his unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the warbr br id like to see a film about hitlers life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations i really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like the ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this because it seems as if they didnt even know what really happened hitler wasnt even shot in the revolutionary march in munch his shoulder was ripped out of its socketbr br it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this
