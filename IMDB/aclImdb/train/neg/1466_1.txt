br br as usual i was really looking forward to a new tvfilm on a favourite subject of mine  makes a nice change from a strangely familiar documentary about kursk or stalingrad on the history channelbr br i avidly looked forward to pearl harbour and enemy at the gates  but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent stupidifying power of hollywood  and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripebr br so yet again i got excited about the rise of evil especially as i heard that ian kershaw was involved as ive enjoyed his books i can see why he quitbr br to quote some guy responsible for this rubbishbr br the kershaw book was an academic piece he said it wasbr br quite dry we needed more incidents br br incidents are they totally nuts hitlers life cannot be said to be without incident  yes kershaws two volume hitler biographies were long and detailed but they were supposed to bebr br the thesis behind rise of evil seems to bebr br hitler was a very bad man  no he was a very bad man who hated jews and just in case you miss this were going to emphasise the fact in every scene in the filmbr br there was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time and why hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did needless to say  unlike the generally excellent nazis  a warning from history  this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the munich communist rising were jewish and that this may have coloured his views on the subject  and his axiomatic linking of the jews with bolshevism  an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the nazi erabr br but there was not much understanding to be done  the filmmakers werent going to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway we certainly dont get the fascinating fact that kershaw alludes to which has hitler briefly being a socialistcommunist immediately after ww1 that would of course be far too complex for the film to handle and might even detract from the relentless he was very bad mantra which bangs away incessantlybr br we know he was a bad man however we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations he could be polite and even sympathetic and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism antialcohol and antismoking that many guardian readers could agree with he was also famously fond of animals hence why that wholly invented dogflogging scene was so absurdbr br he was also from all the accounts ive seen a brave soldier in ww1 whilst we saw him with his iron cross we never get to see how he won it acts of bravery were not in the script needless to say we also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences whilst sassoon owen brook remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience and again like the point above re the jewishbolshevik link this is vital to anyones understanding about the subject why did he love war so much why did he think it was always a good idea despite massive evidence to the contrary why didnt he care about his colleagues who died or maybe he did  but still drew the wrong conclusionsbr br this film certainly didnt have anything of any interest to say on this eitherbr br as all too often these days the film is a classic example of making history relevant to the present and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with the present  which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator where you dont trust your audience an inch so you just ram stuff down their throats knowing sadly correctly that youll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the worldbr br history is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present for better and for worse this rubbish was a great opportunity lost again they spent millions on it and the locations and large scenes were impressive but told us nothing at all we didnt know already and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human historybr br wt
