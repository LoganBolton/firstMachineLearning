i was looking over our dvd tower last night for something to watch we were between netflix mailings and it was a quiet saturday night i pulled one out that i never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend from the jacket it sounded like a ripoff of the big chill but with the allstar cast felt it might be worth watching boy was i wrong not only was it like the big chill it was a ripoff almost character by character the bill paxton character was a copy of william hurt where have you been all this time role spoiler warning and lo and behold he remains behind to take care of the old placecabincamp kimberly williams  meg tilly jerk womanizer matt craven  jeff goldblum etc etc i found myself wondering why im even watching these people there was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them how did unca lou even find these characters after 20 years plus it wasnt even funny except when perkins fell err flopped out of bed the first morning it was a sign and i missed it after it was over i asked my wife were there any endearing characters in this film  are you sleeping over there she replied no im still thinkingno none i can think of
