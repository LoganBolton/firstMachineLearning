i have seen dolemite and also avenging disco godfather two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore but this film the human tornado aka dolemite 2 will always hold a special place in my heart for sheer goofiness lack of skill in film production and absolute enthusiasm frankly a little too much the human tornado cannot be toppedbr br the opening scene sets the tone our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason and wouldnt you know it the woman in bed with ol dole is none other than the sheriffs wife her cry when she sees him he made me do it dolemites cry  are you for real subtlety was never his strong pointbr br highlights the cameo by a very young ernie hudson of ghostbusters fame the continuity errors characters looking one way in one shot and another in the next dolemites suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act and queen bees demonic eyes in her first scenebr br but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself did the man really think he looked cool in this movie i certainly dont know why but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff or barking orders to his gang in rhyme eg quick into the cave i have a plan to let that mother  dig his own grave the man commits totally certainly he goes overboard nevermore so than any time hes doing kung fu the climactic battle is filmed at high speed but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth im not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast in any event the matrix it is notbr br human tornado much like the original dolemite is an incompetent film of enormous proportions but at least its fun and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort just not that much enjoy with my hearty recommendations
