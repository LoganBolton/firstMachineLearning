valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list think halloween friday the 13th scream and i know what you did last summer it certainly isnt as good as those movies that i have listed about but its better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first friday the 13th film one of those films was the 1981 canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but its not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then theyre picked off onebyone the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david boreanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw and katherine heigl they do what they can with the material theyve got but a lackluster script doesnt really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however br br  out of four
