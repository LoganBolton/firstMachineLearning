for your own good it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie this flick stinks now i like at least in theory low budget horror movies but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make it takes itself way too seriously and unfortunately thats not its only problembr br its the story of the murderous beane clan of the british ilses transposed to modern times an interesting premise but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching itbr br 1 why is the biggest name on the cd box jenna jameson shes a below average looking woman who cant act and she has a minor role answer shes apparently a well known porn star as you no doubt read in other reviews so i guess this is a cameo appearance for her shes giving the film much needed name recognition it seems her top billing isnt any indication of her talent though its an indication of how untalented the rest of the cast isbr br 2 how can film makers be so stupid to think canada can be passed off as ireland it doesnt even remotely look like ireland and the house that the guestsvictims stay in is this great big north american wood frame edwardian thing they should have skipped the whole beane theme and developed a story that took place in na also if youre going to make a movie that takes place in ireland its probably best to have more than one character with an irish accent and that was a really really really bad irish accent nowthis wouldnt have been so bad if the director wasnt trying to make the next night of the living dead but it seems he was too bad he could have had some fun with it in fact some of the scenes werent far from being unintentionally comedic as they werebr br like the infamous gutting scene were the woman is chained to the table stripped naked and then sliced open and eviscerated thats funny you ask well in the deleted scene version the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines its actually funny after awhile and what self respecting cannibal eats intestines anyway do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens heck no we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks oh wellbr br some of the other cast who were annoying the whiny creepy howard rosenstein im not sure but i think he was supposed to be cast as a stud in fact hes as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying gillian leigh fell for himbr br i checked gillian leigh on her link on imdb and apparently its important to know that she graduated high school with honors i cant decide if its more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation the honor student is doing nude softcore porn scenes in a shower with a guy named howard rosenstein wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie if they have hopefully theyll get the message avoid this fate go to college i could go on and on but why if you like gore youll find something redeeming in this flick but not much more
