i had to register for imdb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie ismy cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this not the worst acting ive ever seen but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes it leaves a bit to be desired there wasnt a single scare moment in the movie with the exception of when they were watching the movie halloween on the tv all around it seems like it couldve been a good story rolling the credits and saying that chasey lain was in it was a bit of a loss as i didnt recognize her right away and her scene was already over before i couldve said oh yeah there she is im so glad i saw this in a hotel and didnt pay for it as id be real ticked if i had payed a cent to see this i normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie but this one is an exception its so bad that its not even that amusing sogooditsbadits just plain bad
