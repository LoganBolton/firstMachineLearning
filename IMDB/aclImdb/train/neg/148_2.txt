im in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst ive seen in a long time ive seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesnt take itself too seriously but really i think thats a cover up for the fact that its horrible its not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you havent seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that youll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to clich√© visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldnt even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if youre going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin dont let stunt folk act they cant also the comment about this being a return of old vampire moviesno its not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld theyre all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because its better than i could do of course i also know i cant make movies so i dont try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week ive seen several thousand in the year ive been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack
