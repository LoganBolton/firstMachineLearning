first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and shes just awful this movie has every horror move clich√© in imagination and all badly played the oversexed teen couple the comicalnothorny jock the snotty cool chick the creepy local color guy the parentaltype couple the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool its almost like youre wishing that theyd all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jamesons implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs
