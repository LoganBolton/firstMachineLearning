rented a batch of films from blockbuster last night and this was the first one i watched it was late on a saturday night wanted a horror film fixbr br wow this was awful almost embarrassingly so stupid slashertype story i really thought films like scream had put an end to amateur actors delivering clich√©d and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read off a page and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about especially when occurring in a film this poorly scriptedbr br but ive always believed no film is 100 percent totally worthless heres the few good things i can say about this mess br br 1 bobbie phillips love this actress shes the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever the only reason i took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover she acquits her presence in this dreck with professionalism even though she looks bemused at times that shes acting in such a moronic storybr br 2 unintentional hilarity this is the kind of film i can remember seeing back when there were still grind house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triplebill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making its way to the hinterlands unfortunately in this directtovideo age most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the communal experience of being part of an audience jeering and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible which leads tobr br 3 porn stars trying to act mostly on hand because the producers dont need to cajole or plead with them to disrobe for extended sex scenes but this tradeoff usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story other than ooh yeah baby or harder and proudly they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act id almost exclude ginger lynn allen from this group if her character wasnt supposed to be an irish mom and shes actually attempting at times to do an accent which just keeps the smiles comingbr br its nice to look for the positive in all experiences and thats what i took from this cesspool aka evil breed
