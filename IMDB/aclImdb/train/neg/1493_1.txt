i really dont get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading leviticus br br first of all surely they could have 2 found real irish people and some goodlooking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film granted the gore works but strangely its not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars hot formerly tight bodies left and right probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in painbr br so if you dont care at all about the following br br  acting seriously everyone sucked ive never witnessed this before everyone suckedbr br plot some crappy horror movies are remotely linear or at the very least surprising this movie doesnt make sense unless youre as trashed as the writers obviously were br br  theme nothing to learn from this film nothing to be scared about in bed at night nothing to contemplate or grasp or explain to others br br  soundtrack crap crap crap music as ordinary and dull as the script br br  scenery could have been this films saving grace but nonothing pleasing here even the rocks are fakebr br so yeah if you dont care about that and youre just a horny teen with bad taste in music and women this movie is for you positive comments interesting cinematography at times wasted on the other elements very realistic gore again wasted but the intestines scene is classic i agree with the mutant disembowelment solves the fake accent problem
