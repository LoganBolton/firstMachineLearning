justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside lets just take this movie as its offered without extraneous explanationsbr br this movie is god awful straight up craptastic rather than rehash what may serve as a plot ill run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my headbr br a class of 5 take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin nowhere ireland these students may be canadian or american its difficult to tell that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass 80s movie except when he channels randy from scream one character may be chris kleins stunt double he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but its never really established if that is true one character is sullen and removed from her peersjustcuz and then theres a blonde girl yay blonde girlbr br ireland has a population of 2 theyre cousins gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once hes very ominous and wears a knit cap his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyondbr br picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenesbr br the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails good for thembr br unbeknownst to me horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives perhaps theres some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the registerbr br also unbeknownst to me if you inbreed for roughly 600 years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat lumpy yet amazingly spry and fairly strong genetics are a wonderful game of crapsbr br there may or may not be more than one freak in this film reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever and when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed im running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one thats what it looks like on screen anywaybr br richard grieco should be ashamedbr br also of note aside from those shiny new knives the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once richard grieco cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied upwho also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone upbr br a dead body in a shack will be maggotridden after what i would guess is about 2 hours has passed said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them curiousbr br jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left chats for 2 minutes vanishes stage left in the middle of a giant forest thats not unusual as gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screenbr br ms jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldnt suck windbr br i offer a special nod to the breeder character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months or maybe years for breeding purposes the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahuabr br the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the yearsbr br apparently this wasnt just random crap i found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through its production how sad for you all i have nothing more to say may god have mercy on us all
