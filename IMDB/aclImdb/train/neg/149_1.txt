well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie ive seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this rolebr br the lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkeybr br bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this cant disguise the fact that the lady doesnt know how to throw a punch an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showingbr br sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didnt win the golden raspberry for its year
