i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre and i usually also like most of the cheaply made ones infamous director demofilo fidani however is rightly known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contributions to the genre the plots of fidanis movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous spaghetti western names like django of sartana to the titles i the particular case of gi첫 la testa hombre of 1971 he just took the title of sergio leones gi첫 la testa aka duck you sucker and added hombre the movie can be found under various titles fistful of death western story i personally bought it under the name adios companeros which this movie shares with another fidani film with almost the same cast per una bara piena di dollari which is also entitled adios companeros in the german language versionbr br the plot is rather weak it basically follows a guy named macho callaghan jeff cameron and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by butch cassidy jack betts and ironhead gordon mitchellbr br the leading performance by jeff cameron is kindly stated not very convincing neither did i find jack betts very good as butch cassidy bmovie legend gordon mitchell however is always worth a try and although he probably wasnt a very good actor i always found his performances in the spaghetti westerns quite funny and original and he actually saved some of fidanis movies such as the rather crappy django and sartana showdown in the westbr br there is one very funny and original thing about gi첫 la testa hombre  the great klaus kinski is playing a priest i could have imagined kinski in any role but before seeing this movie i would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest kinski is once again great although he has only little screen time and one scene where he breaks up a fight is probably the only good scene in this one more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze joe damato did the cinematographybr br gi첫 la testa hombre is a cheap crappy film but nevertheless it has some funny moments being a spaghetti western enthusiast i found it fun to watch but if youre not never mind this movie or watch it only for the purpose of seeing kinski play a priest 310
