a quite usual trashy italowestern stupid storyline full of clich√©s and lack of logic some mediocre actors dirty settings lots of punchfights and people shoot dead on a massive scalebr br this has nothing to do with django  at least not in my german translated version this german dvdrelease is called adios companeros and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one hes the only survivor then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because hes just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway yeah thats it no more cleverness in the storyline hehebr br a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable thats why i bought this dvd in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming i said love and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second  fantasticfantasticfantasticbr br its also remarkable that joe damato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography  i love this master of incompetent exploitationthrash so it was an aahhh for me
