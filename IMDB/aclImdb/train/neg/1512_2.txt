a bad ripoff attempt on seven complete with subsecondgrade acting awful camera work halfbaked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda yeah them sex offenders they live next door and youre gonna get raped reallybr br no surprises from the viceterminatrix woman she acts as always  as convincingly as a piece of wood richard gere keeps on sliding lower and lower  and is about as low here as a late steven seagalbr br the singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when shes dead in bed and even the wolf was subpar although she was the best performer in the movie  maybe they fed her before the shots or somethingbr br unlike seven which had a made up but interesting story to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country this movie seems to focus on a usonly obsession if one doesnt care much about sex offenders  and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain suffering and death  there is little reason to see it or to be afraidbr br there are some body part fetishes and some snuff but the gore is less then mediocre and fails both as artistic device because it is pointless and as gore because it is not gory enoughbr br dont waste time on this one
