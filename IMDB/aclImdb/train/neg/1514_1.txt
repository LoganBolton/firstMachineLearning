i just saw this film yesterdaybr br my girlfriend wanted to see it only because of richard gerebr br i feel i wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend its the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actoractress is in it i hope she learned the lesson because i had trouble keeping her in her seat as of me since i paid already i wanted to see the end at least just in the hope something good would turn up but i didnt hold my breath and luckily so cause i would have been a victim of the film just the samebr br this is not a black and white film its a black and black one the main character richard gere is almost as bad as his registrants and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad speak of a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical us phobiabr br richard geres acting was good as usual but the blond girl thats supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best totally unconvincing for the jobbr br the film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap dramatic and sensational turn that just is unreal they just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders vigilante beating rape and torture  something that almost seems gratuitous they even have a wolf attacking people in the film  how low can you getbr br i gather the film wont come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd thats were it should have stayed in other countries too but because its hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it believe me without gere the film is not even worth a bseries movie
