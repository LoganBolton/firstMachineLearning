i watched the movie the flock because of the casting of gere and danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting this was one of the worst movies ive seen in a long while and ive seen some turkeys ive never posted online before but this movie was so awful i had to do so i suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish its unbelievable the story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite its nauseating poor gere he deserves so much better as for the geredanes on screen matchup because of the horrible writing one doesnt believe either character for a single minute ill bet gere wishes he could buy back the negative were such a thing possible its a shame to see talent wasted so badly not to mention i wish i could get my 2 hours back i know what youre thinking how do i really feel
