although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowherebr br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire his office thrusts upon him his replacement allison lowry claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job and that job aint very fun he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but erroll is good at his job even if his methods arent he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants pasts it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how outoftouch hes become by being too close to his jobbr br when a teenage girl goes missing in errolls area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back their battles become as fierce as errolls need to find this missing girlbr br although the setup for the story was okay it didnt have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the erroll character very well battling retirement worried about everyone whos near his flock disgusted with those hes responsible for overseeing disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him theres not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughablebr br ill be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge nono or trampling through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no endbr br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes character allison shes almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and were never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isnt a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up
