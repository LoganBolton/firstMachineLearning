you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilersbr br im sorry but spielberg didnt deserve to win any oscar for this piece and i think the academy was right in that vote other oscars for best actor nominations and such that i dont know about but it would be hard to justify given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product the way spielberg directs this is so contrived so meddlesome while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered sentimentality is sugary and unreal a false view of life this is overthetop sentimentality when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film all the men crowding around miss millies car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings hes working on a cheap slapstick gag the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel as if magically entranced by the choirs singing on and on nothing rings true i even wondered if harpos name was chosen purposefully because its his wife sophias real name oprah backwards spielberg isnt above such cutenessbr br its not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion schindlers list was amazing deeply touching for me and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism even if the story is a bit contrived
