really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makersbr br if youre going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talkingbr br there seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenesbr br terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end creditsthe werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didnt even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wristsbr br i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movieno reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video
