spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that  lucius shepardbr br the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif  innocence interrupted by men  permeates the entire filmbr br the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his childrenbr br all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixiedust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long timebr br the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and selfdiscovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebratedbr br spielbergs film however reframes walkers story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs br br this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are oversexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words its the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv its all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracybr br of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walkers novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kinbr br beyond walkers hate letter to black men and spielbergs bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielbergs camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celies kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williamsbr br problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film arent portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alonebr br and so theres a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didnt respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you wont run afoul of the dominant white culture br br 310  a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless
