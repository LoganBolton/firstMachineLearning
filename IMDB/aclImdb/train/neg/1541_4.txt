i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the british the film effectively blames the people of ni as being the cause of their own troubles it suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with britains partition of ireland and domination of its history ie ni was created by britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of irelandbr br the characters are portrayed as hapless fools even though i despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause  maintaining their artificial privileges over the catholic community it is a known fact that british intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war no doubt to keep the catholics at bay and demoralise republicanismbr br nineties values about machismo masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish psyche which leads to violence the stupid song from the woman in the club  old ireland of green fields blahblah  is given a symbolic stature ie poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause tedious ahistorical cheap and nasty trash osullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis
