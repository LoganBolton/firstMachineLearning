first of all id like to say that i love the ladies man sketch on snl i always laugh out loud at tim meadows portrayal of leon phelps however there is a difference between an 8minute sketch and a featurelength movie watching leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show like the ladies man presents which is reminiscent of alfred hitchcock presents is absolutely hilarious theres a great episode where cameron diaz roleplays monica lewinski and leon plays bill and they call it the oral office see thats funny br br in the movie we dont see leon on the show too often in fact he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country and the plot revolves around his quest for true love involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat signed by sweet thing karyn parsons who is famous for playing hillary on fresh prince of bel air works with him on the show and has a secret crush on leon the movie just piles on one boring subplot after another and the gags are boring as well the first time we see leon mention the word wang its pretty funny when he uses it over and over again supposedly trying to get a laugh the joke has run dry most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before and done better on the snl sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twentyfive minutes they even try to insert a musical number by will ferrell and his gang of ladies man haters who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him to bring some life into this witless comedy ferrell has some funny moments and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role ferrell just has that unique comic talent and hes funny at almost anything he does even julianne moore gets a cameo watching her you cant but wonder what the hell is an oscarwinning actress doing in this movie her name wasnt mentioned in the opening creditsprobably by her consent and of course a movie of this theme has to include the master of love himself billy dee williams billy dee is charismatic as always but even he cant breathe enough life into this film i also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft r  b hits which impairs the film even more giving it a horribly downbeat toneas if the script isnt boring enough i mean this is supposed to be a comedy the soundtrack wouldve been appropriate for something like love jones br br the ladies man only has sporadic laughs there are exceptions in which snl can produce a great movie out of a short sketch watch both of the waynes world movies and youll see how its done but this movie just like adapting mary catherine gallaghers character to screen in superstar shows the flip side some sketches are meant to be remembered on snl and not on the silver screenbr br my score 3 out of 10
