i could name plenty of funny movies there are comedies that set out to be funny and are some movies like a gymkata for example try to be serious but end up funny the ladies man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust its antifunnybr br i dont think i laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie its simply unfunny its boring stupid inane annoying mindbogglingly bad but not funny i dont particularly care for tim meadows or this character from snl but i expected better than thisbr br the movie is completely lacking logic or common sense its like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he couldnt see which keys he was hitting they tell the origin of the ladies man but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like its still the seventies the movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn shortly after he tried to hang himself this is comedy i like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor spending a lot of time writing comedy as i do but maybe im just not quite bright enough for this filmbr br lee evans so funny as tucker in theres something about mary is outrageously bad here i was pleading with him in my head to shut upbr br by the end i was pounding on my chair muttering under my breath and had the film gone on any longer would probably have attempted suicide this film might not be as bad as battlefield earth but its the first movie ive seen thats come closebr br
