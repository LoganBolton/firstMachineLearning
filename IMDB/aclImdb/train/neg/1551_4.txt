the ladies man is a funny movie theres not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an snl movie its actually better than most snl movies ie superstar or a night at the roxbury tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny chris parnell was also funny in his short scene one of the funnier ones in the movie other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows ive definitely seen funnier movies but ive seen dumber ones too again its not exactly a deep movie but its good for a few laughs it was funnier as a skit though but still if youre looking for a pretty funny movie id recommend this one just dont think about it too much or youll hate itbr br rating 610
