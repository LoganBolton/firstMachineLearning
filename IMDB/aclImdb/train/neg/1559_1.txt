this may very well be the worst movie ill see if i live to be 100 i think a group of firstgraders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this im dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this filmbr br and after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to vomitbr br no one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about anythingbr br i cant believe fx shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz channels  not even the main one and it was on at about 3 am at that
