for the knowledgeable beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events omitted events wildly exaggerated events omitted people timeline errors misattribute quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame shame incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so youll have to be on your toesbr br i didnt give this a 1 primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors the band rain give it their all the lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for somethingbr br so watch it for fun but please dont take it as historically accurate
