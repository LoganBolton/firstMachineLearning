zu warriors most definitely shouldve been an animated series because as a movie its like watching an old anime on acidthe movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or somethingwhether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god demonwizard thingthe plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this moviethe plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flyingprincess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or somethingeven the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but im going to say they are blurry and acid trip like yes thats a wordi watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understandwho am i kidding i didnt understand it at allit felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980s anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire timei can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inuyasha at episode 134 drunkyeah thats right you dont know what the hell is going ondont waste your brain trying to figure this out
