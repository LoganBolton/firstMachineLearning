argh this film hurts my head and not in a good waybr br maybe its just my growing hatred for the action genre but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy seals i still regarded this film with dislike now i utterly despise itbr br take one fairly good fastpaced story keep the title and throw the rest away instead use some halfassesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena what about the cameras why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded roombr br the whole film screams eighties from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes ughbr br dont watch this film i know some people liked it but some people get off on being peed on and i dont understand them either
