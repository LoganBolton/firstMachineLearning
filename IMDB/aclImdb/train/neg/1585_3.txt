spoiler alertbr br soooo arnies really a good guy but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders hes sent to jail or rather some sort of work camp he escapes but after a short while hes caught once again this time ends up in a freakish reality show in which hes supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die but we all know arnie and we all know that hes tougher than even the toughest of tough guysbr br i really wanted to like this movie being an arniefan and all however the running man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me eg the reconstruction of arnies fight inside the helicopter where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident complete with 510 different camera angles this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members one of which inside the eye of one of the crew members arnie beatsbr br there are other flaws also and the plot which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative works for a while then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drownsbr br the acting cant really be said to be anything better than sub par with arnie in the leading role doing an average arnie performance the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or badbr br the special effects are ok without being impressivebr br rating 310
