i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen kings book the one this movie was based on after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally disappointed the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book schwarzeneggers character is put on a game show the main object is to survive but hes not in an arena hes set loose in the city and has to escape the game shows i guess youd call them villians who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax the movie was absolute garbage there was no cinematic quality to it i totally respect arnold schwarzenegger as an actor but he messed up with this one
