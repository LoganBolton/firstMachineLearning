this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers who did pretty good for newbies but over all the movie was not believablebr br with all of the gunfire you would think the police would have intervened even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug was not realisticbr br looks like this movie was slapped together fast poor job get a better writerbr br the count down to the end was not in sync with anything it took longer to fight and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean hed be out of bullets once i can believe but not twice br br actually billys character was goofy it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end it was like a comedy bad bad bad
