hah so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well im glad that i didnt participate and didnt winbr br isnt it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movieor part of this teleplay since it was produced for tv and we couldnt bear to watch the whole thing one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodgepodge of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show so the bar wasnt really high the most watched movie in my group was girl next door and it wasnt because of the great script d  but this movies total lack of originality acting scripting and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas or was it csi dont remember without any complaints by the rest of the group and that is rare for heavens sake dont by this movie if its on tv then yes watch it and contemplate on it my conclusion well since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best actionfilms out there die hard matrix 1 to name some i can only say that producers dont give the film its quality they provide money for the directors and to sell this movie just because its a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it
