after watching many of the next action star reality tv eps tivo taped this gawdawful tripe for me for some bizarre reason  and i only have myself to blame  i watched the whole thing hoping that there would be something unique in the entire movie after so much hype about joel silvers midas touch with action flicks he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemybr br first the only redeeming value of the entire film was billy zane and even he couldnt lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper having said that zanes performance falters about 2 3rds of the way through as he doesnt even seem to know what else to do other than look smug br br cant blame him here though the writing quite frankly sucked lets take ideas from rat race enemy of the state terminator midnight run and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it and whos brilliant idea was it to have two bridge chase sequences in a rowbr br sean carrigan the man of the hour of the next action star shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series a onenote johnny sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film quite frankly we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about midway through as carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him his dumbbutlucky routine gets old as there really isnt anything about the character to root forbr br but carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden rigid corinne van ryck de groot did howard fine really tell her to pretend to be a terminator for the first half of the film i dont think so i kept expecting her to quote arnie her character performance can be compared only to the dramatic depths of freddy got fingered though not nearly as welldeveloped the camera loves her in dark shadowy limousines but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen jeanne bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than corinne showed at any part of her screen timebr br ultimately sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast but shouldnt have been left to do this one solo it was simply too big of a task for him next action star colleague jared elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization but its hard to tell given jeff welchs lame script someone should take welchs imac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else and finally van ryck de groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach even for complete shlock like this br br joel silver should be ashamed
