to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story its set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta youngs shes on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husbands plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and theyre not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babiesbr br there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hotwater bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds theres now a law against selling an example of her repartee be careful farrell its too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but dont expect her to be given a dramatic momentbr br the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is
