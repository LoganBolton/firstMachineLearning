wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and unmovingbr br apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest princess mononoke much there they meet a dorky kid named sam and the plot beginsbr br so tom ash and huck sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free celebi the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i dont even know what else went on it all went by in a blur ashs friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boringbr br after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam float away with celebi that scene was just creepy oo then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his rivals grandpa and i think thats it pretty retarded isnt it if you love your children you wont expose them to this 1 out of 10
