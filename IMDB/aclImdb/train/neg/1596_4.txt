not one of the better pokemon moviesbr br two legendary pokemon come into the story you do get to see how strong celebi can be though he turns evil firstbr br suicune also makes an appearance he didnt seem that powerfulbr br the marauder didnt have many strong pokemon at all except for that taranitar some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it betterbr br ash and pikachu meet the much younger professor oak though they dont realise it misty i was thinking had it at the end but she didnt get close i saw this in the creditsbr br dont expect much here the worst of the series so far
