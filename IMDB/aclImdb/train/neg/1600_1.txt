the biggest national lampoon hit remains animal house and rightly so it was funny raucous and goodnaturedbr br the exact opposite of every other national lampoon film including class reunionbr br please do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst flounder from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painfulbr br one star and thats being generous then again i always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too
