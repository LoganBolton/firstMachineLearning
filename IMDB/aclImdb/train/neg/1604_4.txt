remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesnt quite meet those same feelings as an adult that occurred to me when i went back to schoolthe national lampoons class reunion the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth a man who appears to be a vampire and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head you have the class president who believes hes the best thing since sliced breadbut as we see in the film hes a coward and joke a couple of pot smokers who dont even know they are at their own class reunion and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existedand no one can seem to remember his namethis is the one running joke i enjoyed there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog and the cookyou know her from goonies and throw mama from the trainwho loves to place food on peoples plates with her hands the film is essentially about a nutcase who isor at least attempting totaking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on himthey arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened trashed hallways of the old high school they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself the film has a few good gags that workpretty much early on but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute the films true problem is that it really doesnt know where to go the film is pretty much a onejoke premise for it has unassured directionif it really has any direction at all the cast is enthusiastic enough but the material they are to make funny just doesnt have the quality to hold any interest its a curio for fans of early 80s comedy relics that are forgottenthis one rightfully so
