recently i saw the documentary the revolution will not be televised also know as chávez inside the coup at first i thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the venezuela coup of april 2002 what bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive and that at no point any criticism was expressed about hugo chávez this is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an nonbiased account of what happened there should have been some of that too after all chávez certainly is not a saint fortunately since the documentary is several years old a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find for instance urgent investigation about chavezthe coup by the 5 european tv corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about venezuela it lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary just use the title as a search string in google you will find it another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary xray of a lie to me it seems to be a good counterweight to chávez inside the coup its available at videogoogle i strongly advice you after watching chávez inside the coup to look at xray of a lie and then form your opinion my conclusion is that kim bartley and donnacha obrian were knowingly or not part in chávezpropaganda
