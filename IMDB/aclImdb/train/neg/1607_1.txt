this documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes the fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in venezuela something even we venezuelans dont know for surebr br there are ways of lying and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge br br the venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and they take advantage of that for instance possible spoilers they show proch치vez demonstrators shooting at an empty street what the hell they did that for in a way of saying they didnt kill anyone but didnt bother showing the images we all saw here of opposition demonstrators and a journalist falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street they cant explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the president a few days after the coup the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national assembly our congress why didnt they act against the snipers and he said cause they werent there to act against the president isnt that a confessionbr br there is so much more the fact that the highest rank military announced that ch치vez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because thats politics and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of ch치vez administrationbr br it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo ch치vez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs when the truth is that 6070 of people rejects his government and that percentage includes the poorbr br i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 liesbr br nazi propaganda has returned
