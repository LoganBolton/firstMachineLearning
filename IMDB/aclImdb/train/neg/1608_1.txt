charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about himbr br i dont know whats worse being captured by one of ches murdersquads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isnt why this petproject was made but what took them so long by them im referring of course to leftwing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltowns least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even its a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically onesided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and wellknown communist hasnt been a film topic of theirs yetbr br guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truthbending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood bigbudget political fairytale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi ie almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this mans actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family  which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the directors lack of sound judgmentbr br the movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3hour mark so its quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the films length indicates that a bulk of ches life has been shown here  then think again soderbergh focuses on ches last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevaras alleged idealism psychopaths dont have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of ches earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this overpraised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4hour moviebr br soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side  which is more than 90  of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a humanist  a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold  but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term theyre supposedly siding withbr br half of all students around the world wear ches image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this mans face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines ones overall shallowness and total disinterest in selfeducation wouldnt you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising hisher face to the world wearing ches bynow clich√© image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup all those chewearers probably know more about marges blue hair than theyll ever read up on about fidel castros dead allybr br after everything thatd been done in the name of marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest it seems mankind will never learn stalin mao kim il pol pot castro milosevic ceausescu the iron curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically andor mentally through this system so none of that matters huh br br the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work  and vote hint sean penn headed a jury not long agobr br for my musicrelated rants go to
