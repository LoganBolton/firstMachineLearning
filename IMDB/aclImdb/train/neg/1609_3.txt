the first part che in cuba is about that portion of his life it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded remember that che was a physician it ends as castro wins the revolution che never gets to havana the second part che in bolivia is about guess what it contains too many indistinguishable battles and che ministering to too many indistinguishable woundedbr br when i realized this was supposed to be an epic i never knew anything but the title before it started i naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all david leans lawrence of arabia more of that laterbr br not to be a racist but aside from what ive already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well indistinguishable  unknown hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear che beards and all wear che fatigues this results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than che benicio del toro even fidel has a very minor role while del toros terrific think of lawrence with peter otoole as the only discernible character no alec guinness no omar sharif no anthony quinn etc you get the ideabr br because the other characters are interchangeable this results in a loss of reference when top aides of che are killed you feel no remorse since you dont know who they are even when che is killed i dont think thats a spoiler theres no empathy from the audience  hes just killedbr br hes too onedimensional to relate to as a human being aside from being a revolutionary and second only to jesus in moral rectitude the only thing we learn about che is that hes married with five children he tells another character that near the end what was his motivation a complete enigmabr br maybe soderbergh is purposely aping lean like soderberghs che lean never lets us know anything about lawrence the mystery man of arabia but at least lawrence had a friend sharif and associates guinness quinn he was as courageous as he was insecure  ie had human qualities che is like a machine about as warm as the terminatorbr br earlier this year there was another war epic mongol che makes mongol look like its a wonderful life
