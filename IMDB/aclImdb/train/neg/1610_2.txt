what i found so curious about this filmi saw the full 4 hour roadshow version is how oddly dispassionate it is for a film about 2 very charismatic mencastro and che engaged in a gargantuan political struggle its almost totally devoid of emotional fire the scenes between benicio del toro and demian bichir who is at best a second level actorwith a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che go here go there do this and that with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castrojoaquim de almeida but hes shunted aside in a minor part in the second half without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers the film becomes a dullish epiclength film about hairy bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end several of the reviews ive read showered praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely one in fact spent more time talking about soderberghs new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that its entirely in spanish with english subtitlesthis is an odd odd thing to do since a soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b its no more than a competent job of work with an unremarked upon nod to oliver stones jfk in the black and white cut up camerawork when che visits new york if you can imagine reds directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty youd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie
