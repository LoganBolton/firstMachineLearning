now that che2008 has finished its relatively short australian cinema run extremely limited release1 screen in sydney after 6wks i can guiltlessly join both hosts of at the movies in taking steven soderbergh to taskbr br its usually satisfying to watch a film director change his stylesubject but soderberghs most recent stinker the girlfriend experience2009 was also missing a story so narrative and editing seem to suddenly be soderberghs main challenge strange after 20odd years in the business he was probably never much good at narrative just hid it well inside edgy projectsbr br none of this excuses him this present almost diabolical failure as david stratton warns two parts of che dont even make a whole br br epic biopic in name only che2008 barely qualifies as a feature film it certainly has no legs inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history soderberghs 45hrslong dirge just goes nowherebr br even margaret pomeranz the more forgiving of australias at the movies duo noted about soderberghs repetitious waste of hd digital storage youre in the woodsyoure in the woodsyoure in the woods i too am surprised soderbergh didnt give us another 25hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts because he still left out massive chunks of ches revolutionary life br br for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure soderbergh unaccountably alienates if not deliberately insults his audiences bybr br 1 never providing most of ches story br br 2 imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition br br 3 ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events br br 4 barely developing an idea or a character br br 5 remaining claustrophobically episodic br br 6 ignoring proper context for sceneswhatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts br br 7 linguistically dislocating all audiences even spanishspeakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in english and br br 8 pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension why at this late stage the tshirt franchise has been a success br br our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to peter buchman and benjamin vander veen basing their screenplay solely on guevaras memoirs so like a poor student who has read only one of his allotted texts for his assignment soderberghs product is exceedingly limited in perspectivebr br the audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge scenery and circumstances of the revolutionaries but that doesnt elicit our sympathy instead it dawns on us that ah soderberghs trying to hobble his audiences the same as the latino peasants were at the time but these are the same illiterate latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies why does soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them and keep us equally mentally captive such audience straitjacketing must have a purposebr br part2 is more chronological than part1 but its literally mindnumbing with its repetitive bushbashing misery of outlook and lack of variety or character arcs deltoros che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own illdisciplined troops the only letup is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant revolutionaries some of whom violently lack selfcontrol around local peasants or food we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency such as it wasbr br part2s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic again nothing is telegraphed or contextualized thus even the scenes with fidel castro demi√°n bichir are unexpected and disconcerting any selected events are portrayed minimally and latinocentrically with part1s interviews replaced by timeshifting meetings between the corrupt bolivian president joaquim de almeida and us government officials promising cia interventionbr br the rest of part2s woods and dayfornight blue filter just exasperate the audience until theyre eyeing the exitsbr br perhaps deltoro felt too keenly the frustration of many nonamerican latinos about never getting a truthful unspun history of ches exploits within their own countries when foreign governments still wont deliver a free press to their peoplefor whatever reasonthen one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to entice the notsowellread i may not be able to read or write but im not illiteratecfthe inspector general1949 out to their own local cinemas the films obvious neglects and gross oversimplifications hint very strongly that its aiming only at the comprehensions of the lessinformed who still speak little english if they did theyd have read tomes on the subject already and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselveslearning the lessons of history as they shouldbr br such insights are precisely what societies still needand not just the remaining illiterate latinos of central and south americayet its what che2008 gleefully fails to deliver soderbergh buries his lead because hes weak on narrative i am gobsmacked why benicio deltoro deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this its been 44yrs hindsight about guevara was sorely wanted its what i went to see this film for but the director diabolically robs us of thatbr br david stratton writing in the australian 03oct2009 observed that while part1 was uneven part2 actually goes rapidly downhill from there charting ches final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail which feels almost unbearably slow and turgidbr br chethe guerilla aka part2 is certainly no travelogue for bolivia painting it a picture of misery and atavism the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour and the dramaticyet tragiccapture and execution of the films subjectbr br the rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing irritating miseryshockingly for a soderbergh film to be avoided at all costs it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject210
