if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp or john wayne as a communist spy then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncles farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this moviebr br this film is so stupid that it isnt even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boones refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he wont kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the screen consummation of their love its sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys dont have gunsbr br the story is pointless even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasmbr br april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space
