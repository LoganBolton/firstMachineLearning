the one reason i remember this is that it was shown the week after nigel kneales brilliant quatermass serial was broadcast  the trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping hed be like victor caroon from the quatermass experiment stalking the streets of london br br no such luck because the racing game is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing  i suppose if youre a fan of dick francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when the sweeney had just finished and the professionals was still being produced  theres something lacking about the racing game  one trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way  if itd been a trailer for the sweeney youd see jack regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags whod done a blag while the professionals would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside  i think that sums up whats wrong with this series
