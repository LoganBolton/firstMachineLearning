i saw this movie a couple years back i couldnt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richards girl while shes unconscious then jarviss buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richards girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while hes still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those 2 guystrouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i cant stand movies that are disturbing and dont make sense this was the worst film ive ever seen since the 90s version of lord of the flies
