when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a clich√© of canadian cinema sodden lyricism married to vacant metaphorburdened stabs at social commentary but whatever my own films failings i feel much better after seeing thisthisthing for one thing mine ran 20 minutes not 85 and had more content at that every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four five six relentless minutes the male lead is just incredible a browbeating loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of dramaclass improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him admittedly if he werent such an ahole then the third act would make even less sense as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of exploitation values but it doesnt make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper please in closeup until the magazine runs out i take back what i said about autumn born which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time at least i really really hope so
