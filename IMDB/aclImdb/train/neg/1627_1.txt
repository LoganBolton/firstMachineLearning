i used to review videos for joe bob briggs legendary we are the weird newsletter i saw a lot of stinkers but this by far was the worst and the years have not been kind  it remains the most indecent crime against cinema i have ever witnessed dont get me wrong  caged terror is nominally more technically competent than say monsteragogo or the guy from harlem or something of that ilk what solidifies its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension is it a vietnam commentary an ecological protest an incitement to race riot a study of mans inhumanity to man a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to nearly feature length in short a hep young urban professional possibly the most loathesome screen character ever somehow seduces a nubile asianamerican associate into camping in the woods with him after browbeating her with quasiphilosophical clap for the better part of an hour they run across two wandering veterans the unforgettable jarvis a righteous brother and the troubadour guitartoting manson family reject hey a plot twist tension action suspense well no just a climactic gettinglockedinamakeshiftwirechickencoopandlightlybelittled scene the victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters no no please dont meanwhile jarvis addresses the troubadour as trouby once every two minutes bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan picquers pod people thats about all that happens in caged terror and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable but trust me ive seen thousands of movies in my life and this one has remained for the past eight years since i first saw it the absolute worst i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to reassure myself and reassure myself i certainly do i think the element which makes caged terror so particularly hateful is this very little happens and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers really really want to shove some kind of message down your throat but because caged terror is so incompetent and ineffectual what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort this film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours its terrible truly truly terrible folks trust me i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse go see it youll thank me and curse me just for the record my favorite line in caged terror but perhaps ever yeah well you probably think the song of solomon was an allegory for christs love for the church note must be delivered in a tone of concerted condecension
