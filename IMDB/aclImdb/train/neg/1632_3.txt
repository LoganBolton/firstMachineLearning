an apparent vanity project for karin mani who as a hottie charles bronson going around wiping up the scum that mugged her parents or grandparents or something and impressing young hunks with her karate skills in a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prisondyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah i guess there were a lot of movies like this the script is dumber than usual if you can believe that mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would coproduce her own death wish starring role and i find that type sporadically endearing but the movie is an ungainly apparatus competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here and would actively undermine the fantastic mincingincompetent da and a judge that has got to be the producers uncle
