i see quite a few positive reviews on this board trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following i see the usual rantingi guess this movie is just not for the easily offended this movie is not shakespeare etc guess what neither was road trip and i laughed my a off during that movie theres a way to make a crude tasteless comedy and deliver laughs and theres a way tojust make it crude and tasteless whipped tries to be swingers without the wit or intelligence it seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14yearold boy for gods sake the characters in this movie are supposed to be whitecollar upright citizensand they talk like some of the idiots i knew in freshman year of high school the dialogue is lacedmore like drownedwith fourletter words you would think that people of their status would have some degree of intelligenceand a more extensive vocabulary just watch a whit stillman film and youll see the difference not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish if you know any successful whitecollar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movieplease let me know and introduce me to them their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty there is absolutely no insight into relationships sex oranything its just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremelyand dont take the word extremely for granted because i mean it with all my heartcrude gags these are gags with no substance gags that are meant more for groans than laughs the scene at the end between amanda peet and her girlfriends was totally uncalled for and totally unconvincing there are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by straight men and play out wonderfully this scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures it involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a womans mouth it was one of those noticeablywrittenbyaguy scenes i wasnt believing it for a second br br whipped is purely a sick male fantasy thats as flat as it is annoying i got very few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy and those were probably a result of desperation when youre not laughing for a long period of time you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things so i wouldnt mark that down as a positive
