i was looking forward to seeing amanda peet in another good role after recently renting the whole nine yardseasily worth the rental by the waybut this wasnt itbr br i remembered that the trailer for whipped was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed new yorker twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms peet was worth a shot so i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me this review is my penancebr br in the first act we have the three lead studs recounting their conquests in a diner what should have been funny or at least telling comes out rather pathetic was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of thisbr br and while i dont mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details they do this every week at the same diner you would think someone would complain oh wait i forgot two other diners do notice in one scene but this is just a setup for a punchline everyone else in the diner is deafbr br the second act has the three studs all falling for mia and then developing brain rot failing to ask each other or her about whats really happening between the four of them and i kept asking myself as the studs keep acting like they have been what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date does she start out with brain rot i kept hoping for erics character the married buddy to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act his role is clearly to dispense advice on being married but why do they even bother to talk to him when they wont talk to each other and his advice sheeeshbr br the third act resolves what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list oh okay thats why brad had that happen and jonathan says this andbr br what laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing even the outtakes during the credits werent very funny ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this moviebr br rating 3
