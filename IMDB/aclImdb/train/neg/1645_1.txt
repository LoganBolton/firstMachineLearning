i just watched this movie last night and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film in a word  dont i seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a quentin tarantinoeddie murphy phase ie every other word was a curse word i dont have a problem with profuse cursing as in good will hunting provided it helps to delve more into the characters in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional gasp or laughter from the audience the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype the wall street jerk the coffee house jerk and the imnotgayjustintouchwithmyfeminineside slightlylessofajerk you just dont give a damn about any of them they are all shallow unredemable losers who you want to see lose for those who dare this film does have a couple funny moments the very beginning and the very end the toiletvibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda uh yeah way really though i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies
