personally while im able to appreciate really good movies i also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap you know those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookiecutter action movie to kill time this is the only movie that i can remember actually shutting off in the middle and i have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it the plot was so contrived and predictable i was calling out what the next scene would be easily and im usually not very good at this the actors were horrible ive seen better acting in middle school plays even the scene cuts were bad the flow was all wrongbr br this movie is like a parody that forgot the funny
