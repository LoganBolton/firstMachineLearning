it just seems bizarre that someone read this script and thought this is funny i mean its so hilarious it just has to be made who was this person is he or she the person really responsible for this are they the ones who owe me for my time more so than the directorwriterbr br this film stinks in most every way possible theres no one shred of good dialogue and not one likable character and the storybr br i prefer the 2nd worst movie ever hulk hogans no holds barred to this by quite a considerable degree it seems almost shakespearen in comparisonbr br the ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes and its still under 80 minutes the outtakes include cast members laughing at the hilarious mistakes theyve made and things that went wrong on the set of this comedy glad to see someone laughing in someway with some connection to this filmbr br nothing in this film is funny nothing it just goes on and on its truly that lame i love films that are so bad theyre good this is so bad itssomething but i dont know what and hopefully will never find outbr br amanda peet doesnt suck outright and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film but that really means littlebr br avoid at all costs
