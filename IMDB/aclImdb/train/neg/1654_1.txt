final score 0 out of 10br br possible scene specific spoilers but who the hell caresbr br yes thats right zero and i rarely give 1s even for the lamest of movies i look for things like music cinematography imagination its humor even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible looking at it within its own genera or subgenera but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here i cant remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldnt seem to change the channel  i sat there simply aghast watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next it was like watching a snake digest a rat br br but lets have some fun and pull this baby apart shall we first of all there is nothing technical about whipped that works the visuals are all sitcom style the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over the music and score not only doesnt contribute anything to the movie  its obnoxious not to mention it doesnt have anything to contribute to anyway the acting is as cardboard as it comes all around and that goes for amanda peet clearly the star that got this train wreck greenlighted too these guys supposedly good friends have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shootingbr br on the creative side there isnt an original bone in its body it has no imagination it shows us nothing we havent seen a thousand times before the whole premise or twist of this movie is based on malebashing and the idea that an empowered women can play men just as they get played anybody that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before twisted shallow women are common malebashing is the norm its not stealing from anything specifically its worse its stealing from clich√©s i cant imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt makes me want to go rent in the company of men  or better yet theres something about mary this movie wants to be a edgier version of theres something about mary so bad you can see the sweat br br the movie has no insights into women men dating sex or really anything cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies on the other end the movie doesnt work as a satire either because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as satirical it doesnt have that grounding in reality that satires need it doesnt even know what its satirizing then theres the dialogue which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other example character 1 fk you character 2 oh yeah well fk you repeatbr br and the bottom line the thing that could excuse all the other discretions there are a lot of movies without plots without good acting with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus been good whipped aint funny not for a second it has no comic skills or timing the situations are all completely phony not based in any shred of truth especially enough to wring laughs out of us the characters all broadly drawn so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator just look at the marquee scene cult classic hair gel scene one of our bumbling antiheroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees mena peets vibrator for some reason light shines down on it as if hes found the holy grail why cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators i do not know while he rubs it on himself he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when oh my mena walks in on him oh my sides br br but strangely enough people actually like this movie of course people also like friends and reality dating shows so i shouldnt be surprised all of this has a common thread however whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex they will like any show or movie or think they like it just because it is about dating or relationships its lack of any quality has no baring on these people just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything datingrelationship related to sell them cheap empty effortless tv movies and any number of products br br the only consilation will be that when i die because i saw this movie ive got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back br br
