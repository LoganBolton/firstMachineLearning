first of all this plot is way overdone  girl wants to make it everyone loves her snobby girl intervenes all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male crushing on the heroine plus singleparent troubles and its so predictable that you can practically recite along with itbr br second of all i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and closeminded  in fact i dont recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptightso classical its really insulting how label classical music in this waybr br third ive went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isnt any point at allbr br and oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly im not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasnt as amazing as they were making it out to be  especially when she was belting she was oversupporting the whole timebr br 110 stars
