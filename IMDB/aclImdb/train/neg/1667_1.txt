i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catchup to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spearswannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spearsinduced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears  skip this movie
