here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire racebr br so what could we call this killing machine its almost like hes some kind of destroyer or eradicator sort of like an exterminator or something whats the word im looking for something that terminates things hmmmmbr br anyway the protector who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a futureborn herotobe the evil uhhhh exterminator kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into peoples eyes and repeating her name threateninglybr br then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable exterminator pursues the couple across the countryside at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle but im not surebr br perhaps in an exciting finale he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of acid then the truck will crash they will be saved but no he will then reemerge as strong as ever he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant where in a terrifying finish he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery and destroyed once and for allbr br but maybe im extrapolating too much after all i did stop watching this movie after mr protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar then tells her the child will be born in 3 days br br the costumes and effects are great in this movie i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant and career sweathog stephen baldwin is also on board as youngs fat cop boyfriend not sure where he fits into the plot though maybe hes an import from a different james cameron movie
