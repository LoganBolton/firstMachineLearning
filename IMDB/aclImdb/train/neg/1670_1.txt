the movies premise is spooky a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a barbr br but as soon as the movie begins a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a c type scifi tv movie its a big star trek and a bit xfiles but more than anything else its boringbr br when the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche it looked more like a 2 parter in a bad scifi tv series no suspense and no thrills but not for a lack of trying just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main charactersbr br dont waste your time
