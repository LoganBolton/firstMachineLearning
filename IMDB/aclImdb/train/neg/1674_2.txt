the premise was intriguing but sadly this film just doesnt do any justice to it the casting was quite good and it was shot beautifully  but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial characters were identified exclusively by onscreen coke usage and pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story a very forgettable film
