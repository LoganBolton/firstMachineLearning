val kilmer solid performance dylan mcdermott solid performance josh lucas solid performance three very engaging actors giving decent performances the problem is who cares about the plot john holmes infamous for his wellendowments a drug addict and a guy who despite contracting aids continued to make adult films just does not make an intriguing characterbr br the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80s in los angelos to which holmes was linked arrested and charged with murder and who ultimately was acquitted just like in the case of oj the guilt factor regardless of the outcome ranged quite high in the he did it zonebr br there is no one to sympathize with in this film as everyone is a selfserving criminal there is just nothing remotely interesting here
