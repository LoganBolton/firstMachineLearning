unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i dont want to give style a bad name still its the most apt description that comes to mindbr br a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in pornbr br but a confusing violent rashomonstyle study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmess life  that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevantbr br to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks  annoying machine gun editing sloppy dogme95 camerawork unnecessary splitscreen graphics and animation etc etcbr br in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these the trendy bleachbypass look of narc or traffic or minority report the frantic often incomprehensible throwthepiecesoffilmintheair cutting style of natural born killers or 28 days later the filleverymomentofsilencewith anoldsongtoevoketheperiod soundtrack of goodfellas or blow the groovy retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on patheticbr br i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland avenue had been around for years had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and holmess growing involvement with seedy la types signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging 70s i think the film could have had meaning it could have served a purpose as it is  meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isnt famous enough to merit such painstaking examinationbr br this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story thats it period and it could have worked whats that oh right right they didnt want to tell a traditional riseandfall story they didnt want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star 80 or autofocus they wanted their film to be different rightbr br well in one sense they succeeded theres a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are goodbr br
