anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them the ncc1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise nameneed i go on berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberrys creation after he died they only saw  and just went their own way no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series i dont blame her for not being involved with this mess poor bakula hes a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space 9 which was untimely canceled
