takashi shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film juon the grudge while i havent seen that film i would have to wager that theres more imagination and originality or some ripoff originality in other words skill with known tropes of the japanese ghost movie than in his own directed remake maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal or i would guess accessibility for an american audience what starts off with some potential  the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullmans sudden movement  just goes into a total jumble and as a horror movie gimme a breakbr br tension could have been built on the situation  a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted  but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel scares hows about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something a black cat yeah why not just make the ghostboy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which in effect is only creepy if you want cats plot why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told meaning while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall they arent or for that matter have us care about anyone in the castbr br by the time the characters or those that are there for exposition get around to telling us what is going on or whatever theres little point to care the filmmaking is shoddy ie the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked gellar especially is disappointing but pullman who shows up later after his first scene is sorely miscast even when shimizu tries for some average old boo scares like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost its still silly just watch when shes going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots either youll go with it and if so more power to you or youll laugh hysterically at the results count me in the latterbr br im not totally sure where this project went wrong  was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing andor dull than they would be with someone else the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesnt make sense or at the least give us some horrorfodder to chew on its cineplex trash of a sad order
