all the kids aged from 1416 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids cant see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is this was one of the worst movies i saw in months every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end its an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when youll be scared br br when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day i could make an oscar with a homevideo of my goldfish if only i use the right marketing
