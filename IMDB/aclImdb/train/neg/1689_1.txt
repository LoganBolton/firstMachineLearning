wow what a total let down the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous the special effects were a direct ripoff of the ring the story was there one not in my opinionjust a bunch of flashy imaging the entire film was a boring stupid mess i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns however this is the worst horror film i have seen in years and that buffy chick well shes a bad actress as plastic as barbie and just as talentedno wait that would be an insult to the talents of barbie i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg13 and had it been rated r it would have bombed imo stupid movie
