this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly wellcrafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable gotcha at the end of each really there is no character development and no real plot to speak of there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms its all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm and his ghost mom with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like the ring take down a bunch of cardboard cutout twodimensional excuses for human charactersbr br this englishlanguage version of the grudge is the equivalent of cinematic junk food satisfying momentarily but not really what you ought to be living onbr br not recommended
