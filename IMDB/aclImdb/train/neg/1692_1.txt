okay if youve seen the ring youve basically seen the grudge its trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that yoko didnt show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and its not really clear what bill pullmans character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didnt make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more
