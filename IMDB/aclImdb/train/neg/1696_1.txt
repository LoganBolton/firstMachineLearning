i hate to throw out lines like this but in this case i feel like i have to the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years there i said it and now that i have gotten that out of my system please let me explain whybr br when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born the curse gathers in that place of death those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing unfortunately the filmmakers take it no further those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get you want more well too bad some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far director takashi shimizu pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original films valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour Â– by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over it pretty much unfolds like thisbr br person walks into housebr br something flashes by the camera andor a strange sound is heard br br person goes to investigatebr br sound starts to get loudbr br person sees a ghostbr br loud scream andor cat screechbr br cut to blackbr br before the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour the first time was actually somewhat creepy each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on by the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black we were never proved wrongbr br the film has no liner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled i have no problem with nonlinear storytelling when it is done right the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason i havent seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander 2 and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyonebr br obviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made 15 million its first weekend the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie the scariest things about the grudge are that it made 40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge
