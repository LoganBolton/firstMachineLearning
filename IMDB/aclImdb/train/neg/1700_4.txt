in film i feel as though it should be more than just art i think it should be more than that a way to tell a story on screen this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy it is good filmmaking but there really isnt anything else to it as ive said before i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i dont see a need for it at all this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know hes still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future if you like lynch check this out but dont be surprised when you dont like it very much
