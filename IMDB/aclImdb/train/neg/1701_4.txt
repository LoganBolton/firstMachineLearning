david lynchs crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about suburban middle class families the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouthhole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises the son and mother are permanently horrified incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the seriesbr br lynch is not famous for his comedies ie on the air aspects of wild at heart and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general however there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bits of animated cinematography  where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions which never really vary in dumblandbr br i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straightforward if disturbing animated comedy here interestingly he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultralowbrow humor ie most will farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and grossout humor while the blend doesnt really work very well here it is nothing if not lynchianbr br worth seeing by lynch fans
