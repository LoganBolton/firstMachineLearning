lets be honest here the only reason anyone bought this the only reason anyone reviewed this and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynchs children but guess what even david lynch can produce a piece of crapbr br maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity initself as a pure subjectofknowing maybe the atrocious cacophonist sounds and chickenscratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanitys place in the world about our relation to the real about the absurdity of it allbr br instead it just says one thing to me i just lost 20br br if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutesbr br there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland  it is meta meta funny that is it is so bad that it isnt even funny because its so bad this fact however is a little funnybr br if you hate yourself and hate your money then buy dumbland if not spare yourself the agony
