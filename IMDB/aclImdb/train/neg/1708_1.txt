ok i really dont have too much to say about this film other than this i have seen over 4000 films in my life and more than 2300 of those were horror films while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best as opposed to my favourite which i can tell you is george a romeros dawn of the dead i can tell you without the slightest hesitation that todd sheets zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seenbr br there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film the acting the dialogue the directing the makeup the music every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even releasedbr br even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this you wont even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display trust me please
