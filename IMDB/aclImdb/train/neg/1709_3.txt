i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with zombie bloodbath as one of its alternative titles perversely this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title which may mean that the other one is really bad this film is pretty bad too obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself zombie bloodbath and expect to see a masterpiece and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on displaybut it all feels very old and tired which isnt helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line its just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what youre in for low quality zombie garbage theres plenty of gore in the film and its a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers the main influence seemed to be romeros superior day of the dead although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore it all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i cant say i was impressed with it
