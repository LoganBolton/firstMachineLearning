viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence now that is funny would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle but trust me folks this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see and if youre not laughing at it five minutes in id say youve lost your sense of humorbr br david niven plays a doomed and bravadobesotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable female air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love just as hes plunging to his certain and fiery death isnt it romantic of course hes spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance and washes up on the beach just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle they immediately clinchbr br looking past the bizarre homoerotic subtexts so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts from a naked boy sitting barebutted in the sand playing the movies twilightzoneesquire theme on his little flute to a celestial courier so campyqueeny his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love we get itfly boys like girls in skirts and heels and girls like em back and apparently all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdbbr br as for the quality of the production the continuityediting is poor enough to induce cringing and the lighting is perhaps even worse than that but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad there are games played with technicolor whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that and foreshadowing so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the docs motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck and freezemotion which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camerabr br the best shots are the early ones on the beach but after that its all downhill the moving like an escalator is moving staircase is hardly the odessa steps to say the least and id really caution anyone from feeling like theyd have to see this lame attempt at moviemaking on their account the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and thats about the best thing i can say for it
