every once in a while a group of friends with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm raimi and co did it with the evil dead jackson and pals succeeded with bad taste and myrick and sanchez made a mint with the blair witch projectbr br director todd sheets and his chums however are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if zombie bloodbath is anything to go by a lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror this miserable effort about a plague of flesheating zombiesÂ—natch serves as a reminder that whilst many people these days have access to a video camera most shouldnt take that as their cue to try their hand at making a fulllength moviebr br its not that sheets hasnt got an eye for a nicely framed shot some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good but rather that a he has a lousy script b he has a lousy cast and c he doesnt realise that he has a lousy script and cast which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists like me or members of the cast and crew like those who have given the film favourable commentsbr br zombie bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gorehounds and sheets who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director certainly goes out of his way to please with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity but whilst these moments are undeniably yucky they arent particularly convincing and soon get rather tediousbr br so to summarise this is a really bad film with almost no redeeming features except for twobr br firstly it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film as sported by jerry angell who plays larry as well as several zombies the magnificence of his barnet coupled with a fetching moustache is reason alone to watch this filmbr br secondly it has pathetic stealth zombies flesheating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack which requires almost no effort to escape from best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it pathetic stealth zombies also occasionally hide behind low walls or sit in churches posing as members of the congregationbr br normally a film this bad would get 110 for me but in celebration of jerry angells flowing locks i will generously raise my rating to 210
