even though this was a madefortv production theres absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product this movie did have a budget and it had a casting department so if youre going to make a movie about a true life story and actually put the true story in the title shouldnt some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism  first of all this movie is absurdly cast these actors belong in daytime television soaps or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movies and not in a reallife gangstercriminal tale everything about them from their looks to their mannerisms just screams of the 90sshoppingmallaltrocklistening generation what about the script  two words describes it  stupid and insulting and again its way too 90ish sounding i dont think the real clyde barrow ever uttered the words im outta here its as if a bunch of new kids on the block fans got together and decided to make a really kewl flick about bonnie and clyde you know one that would be totally rad and rockin well this sticker doesnt even rank on the rad and rockin scale everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here from the casting and acting to the editing and music every single thing is grossly wrongand its infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put the true story in the title its certainly not the true story but even worse its not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick thats accepted on its own terms like i stated in my heading its simply horrible beyond words on every level imaginable trust me on this or watch at your own risk
