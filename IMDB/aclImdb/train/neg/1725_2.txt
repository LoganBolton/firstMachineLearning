 the movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake unbeknownst to the locals a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake the meteor heats the lake turning it into a giant incubator you guessed it the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the communitybr br  what utter garbage its not that i mind the stopmotion clay dinosaur its everything else about the movie that bothers me the acting is atrocious the dialogue is utterly ridiculous the comic relief is anything but comic logic is nonexistent any similarity between the scientists in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie but you get the idea i feel its fairly safe to call this disaster mst3k worthy
