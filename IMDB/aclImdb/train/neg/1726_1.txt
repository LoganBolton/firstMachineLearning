well what are the odds at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateurscientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monsters egg that has been lying there  for over a thousand years i suppose the crater lake monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest yes this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing but its also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch these two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait it is mostly during their prototypic laurel  hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake steve hanson the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case but only if hes not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area halfway through the film there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process this textbook wtf moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country like in new york city or something and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at crater lake only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in hicksville and theres an exhilarating chase through the woods ending in the dinos hungry muzzle the absurd little details in the crater lake monster are too numerous to mention for example this is probably the only creaturefeature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint after they already spotted the actual monster the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as im concerned its like everybody forgot to pay attention to it night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight  all during one and the same diurnal course the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film especially since its accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects the cute critter is a plesiosaur meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator crater lake monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that i can only encourage to track down the miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle and because basically this is a very bad film should be put into perspective because i might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value
