we have a lake we have an animated meteor crashing we have a killer stopmotion dinosaur with flippers okay so lets call this movie the crater lake monster what else can we add hmm two idiots called arnie  mitch to define the ultimate definition of comic relief we also got to have a sheriff who doesnt really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to aw crap were over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy no worries lets introduce some guy with a moustache have him rob a store to indicate hes a bad guy then have him pop up somewhere near the lake have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food that should workbr br a complete clumsy mess this film its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you the first film to feature dave allen as a stop motion supervisor after this one he joined forces with charles band for several years until the the midnineties when band ran out of money to pay him i guess the dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny unfortunately thats about the only good thing that can be said for itbr br good badness yes the mindbending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list if not arnie  mitch will do the trick 310 and 810
