the priyadarshanparesh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie at an indian multiplex with high hopes especially after the slick promos unfortunately like hulchul before it this movie was a huge disappointmentbr br like others have commented the premise of the movie which was already stale to begin with just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering after a while you just want the movie to end so you can go home if i had been watching this at home it would have been much easier to cut my losses akshay kumars performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments but overall because his role and character wasnt given much room to grow he didnt make much of an impact in this filmbr br neha dhupia who makes only an appearance in the movie was fun to look at while she was on screen and some of the songs are fun especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby respectively otherwise youre better off just passing on this movie
