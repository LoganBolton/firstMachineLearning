well maybe im just having a bad run with hindi movies lately i asked the video store guy for apharan prakash jha but being a new release wasnt available yet so i had to settle for this one it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie ive seen and ive seen quite a few no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world if imdb had negative ratings i would give garam masala a 10br br i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up for some strange reason people expect good stuff from piyadarashan i did not like hulchul hungama or his other films hulchul probably dubbed from tamil or telugu came across as very loud inyourface fare that again didnt make much sense except in a bollywood flick this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains who made him a director even a bollywood director at that br br anyhow to the film now what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a nonsensical womanhunt two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment isnt it similar to no entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office jezuz christ now theyre copying their own stories well anyways theres some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multilateral love aka multitasking  multitiming what happened in the end ive no idea i switched off midway what ridiculous junk i cant believe they even released it and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth for which audience did they make it  the poor illiterate indian masses 700 mil at last count or the wellheeled nri desis staying in phoren either ways it doesnt matter neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such godawful stuffbr br its a short review because theres nothing to write about but the usual bag of fgrade garbage bollywood should change its name to follywood and yes this review is much better than the movie itself
