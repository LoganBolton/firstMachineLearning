probably the worst bollywood film ive seenbr br no plot line very little character developmentsbr br full of silly and pointless humor the whole film was chaotic and directionless there was no proper ending to the story the airport was filmed in a shopping mall br br same story chewed over and over again until you want to say please just move on with it even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographedbr br the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these daysbr br btw im not from an indian backgroundbr br 210
