i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshanreleasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences i think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and david dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiencesso it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his directiongive us more of herapheris and malamal weeklys rather than giving duds like garam masala
