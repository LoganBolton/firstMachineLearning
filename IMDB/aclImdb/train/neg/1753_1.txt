dietrich bonhoeffers writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life words can hardly express my disappointment this movie was disjointedit gave no background about his life no historical context and nothing about his great writings except a brief passing reference to the cost of discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie instead we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the states and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany apparently to show his human side ok im ready for the dramatic part the part where he stands up for his faith instead of emphasizing that we get a very badly acted romance with a 17yearold schoolgirl whether or not that actually took place it should not have been a major portion of the movie nowstill waiting for the dramatic part or some narration explaining what his writings were all aboutor something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man drumrollwaiting waitingzip nada this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow with some backgroundeven some voiceovers or flashbacks to him preaching from his workssome narrative about who he was and where he had been but nothis is what we got hardly fitting for a hero of the faith
