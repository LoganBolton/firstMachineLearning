if you havent seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park dont waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money spoilers i cant decide which was worse the movie itself or baldwins hairstyle ellen pompeos acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers give me a break theres only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than oceans 12s which was as meaningless and over the top as this one
