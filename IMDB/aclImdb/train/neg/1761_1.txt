first i realize that a 1 rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out its not bad in a selfaware overthetop sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate its painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mockshock of whats her name see i dont even remember her characters name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh thats right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didnt notice him there hmmm br br its becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money youd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now theres a novel idea br br my suggestion dont see this film dont rent the dvd dont watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied
