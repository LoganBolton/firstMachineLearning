this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be forewarned that art heist doesnt add anything to the genre director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the filmbr br william baldwin keeps reappearing in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the squid and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen pompeo his leading lady doesnt fare much better there is no chemistry between ms pompeo and mr baldwinbr br a movie to be seen at the viewers own risk
