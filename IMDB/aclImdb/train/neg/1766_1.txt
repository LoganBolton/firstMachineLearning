baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of timebr br the sound fx do not sound real they stick out way too much technical gadgets etc if they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps because those gadgets dont really make loud sounds like that natural sounds like footsteps and such are nonexistent which gives it a voidlike atmospherebr br directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film i sure hope it was a low budget production although it does seem fairly amateurish at timesbr br most characters seem empty and false they simply havent casted this movie very well id imagine it wouldve been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used i mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent its shouldve a long ago buried corpse in movie production the production team ever heard of subtitles this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless i mean if the plot again goes like the interpol cant do jack so lets call one american to bring down this international syndicate or whateverbr br sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it id imagine them to have some self respect also are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year maybe they shouldve used the same team as who were making di que si  say i do its spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat looks and sounds much better come on sony wake up produce less sell more
