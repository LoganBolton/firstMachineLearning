1st watched 4292007  4 out of 10dirmick garris campy vampirelike stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 34 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for king fans its the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkersa shapeshifting felinelike flesh eating life needing near extinct breed of humanoid who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive they come across as pretty normal upperclass folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down we get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attackwhich is also a first in my moviegoing experience  hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film the boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a sleepwalker and then he just wants her body there is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an allout satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish hed just get over it and bring out the gore eventually that happens and the movie winds down to its typical stephen king downbeat ending the movie is interesting because kings humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesnt cut it
