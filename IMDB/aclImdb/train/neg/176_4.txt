br br i saw this on the scifi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movie kept me interested i dont know why stop askingbr br spoilers okay it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie in the first movie he had a reason to kill people but in this sequal half of the killingsattempted killings were basicly for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences he captured the cowriter due to creative differences but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast no cast no movie he wanted it to look real when they died if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie use the special effects man of course like the first one the captured girl gets away and stanley ends up getting messed up and dissapears woooooow sarcasm this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake 3 only because i like judd nelson and hes the only good part about this sequal
