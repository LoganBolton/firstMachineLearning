my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made certainly in the top ten of those ive watched all the way through at least plan 9 was enjoyablebr br i did really enjoy christine the dead zone firestarter carrie and some of his other films i didnt care much for cujo only because the sound was so bad on versions ive seen and i often couldnt tell what people were saying or pet sematary pet cemeterybr br but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible the creatures themselves seemed designed by a 9yearold no offense to 9yearoldsbr br even the oneliners made us groan and werent remotely amusing
