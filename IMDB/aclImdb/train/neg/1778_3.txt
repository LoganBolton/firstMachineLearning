i have nothing against a fastpaced frightflick but this stephen kingderived nonsense is too freshlyscrubbed too bright and modern the plot about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a sleepwalkersort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolfand who feeds on the blood of female virgins begs for a more mysterious ambiguous treatment this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel with hardly any atmosphere the kids are predictably pretty and energetic but the big plus is alice kridge as the boys mother kridge from ghost story never broke out of the fillerfemale mold and its a huge loss that she hasnt been used more her performance is creepy and intense and gives hint that sleepwalkers mightve been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction its too overthetop and commerciallydriven with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama stephen king pops up in a cameo as do reallife directors john landis and tobe hooper 12 from
