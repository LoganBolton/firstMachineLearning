it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people but it wasntbr br this work could have been just that marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled the lead characters charles brady played by brian krause and his mother mary played by alice krige were shallowly done had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing not even m√§dchen amick who played tanya robertsons character fit into that description br br however as ive said many times before when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv you simply must take into account the fact that his books arent written for tv and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist br br this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie nothing less but certainly nothing more his screenplays are hit and miss unfortunately this screenplay translation was a miss br br sorry sorry sorry moviebr br this movie gets a 1010 frombr br the fiend
