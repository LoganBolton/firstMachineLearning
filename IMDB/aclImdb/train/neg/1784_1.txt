ok i taped this off tv and missed the very start the film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles i assume so if anything happened before that i missed itbr br lots of people say mark hammill is in this i didnt see him i did recognise clive barker john landis and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendantbr br alice krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien makeupbr br even with the opening titles its never really explained very well exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from from the title sequence i assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting lifeforce from humans i assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kindbr br add to this a very large dose of incest yes i thought it was a bit suspect too shapeshifting killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkersbr br its a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and far too many cameos to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewerbr br avoid
