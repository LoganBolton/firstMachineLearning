i liked batman dead end a dark edgy filmnoir setting for batman was perfect batman dead end is good this is notbr br first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good the best would probably be clark bartram as batman but that isnt saying much he is good at first glance and then you realize he is what he is a bodybuilder who happens to be a tolerable actor but mainly the problem is that batman doesnt belong in the daylight he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartrams face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman dead end probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting its not its quite the opposite its called posing something real actors avoid like the plaguebr br something i never understood why collora casted bodybuilders as the leads it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic of course they might have done better if colloras dialouge didnt leave much to be desiredbr br the entire trailer yes trailer there will not be a fulllength film is more centered around superman then batman but everything on the superman side is corny cloying and amateur michael ohearn superman is one of the worst actors ive ever seen he stands around smiles says his lines thats about it although im not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons once again i say to collora cast actors not bodybuilders actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they dont look exactly like the comic bookbr br the costume is what you would expect superman to wear as for the batman suit well i guess it only looks good in the dark i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shopbr br superman flies in this movie but that isnt a good thing these shots look especially amateur this and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camerabr br the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands and the final shot of twoface and batman at the very end for those of you who have seen the trailer you know what im talking about now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailerbr br finally i ask why if youre trying to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story my only piece of advice for collora here is there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketingbr br batman dead end didnt feel amateur i cant figure out where this went wrong
