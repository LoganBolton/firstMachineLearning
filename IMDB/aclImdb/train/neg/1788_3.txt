giving credit where its due only the technicolor costumes and sets deserve any honorable mentionbr br this is undoubtedly the lowest point in bing crosbys long career at paramount the script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual bing nor william bendix nor sir cedric hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it br br bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig and poor rhonda fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasionbr br just plain awful mark twains wit is not evident in any of the screenplay only diehard crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction even the extras look as though they dont know what theyre supposed to be doingbr br summing up dull as dishwater not recommended even for children
