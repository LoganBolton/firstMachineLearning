this movie was madefortv so taking that into account im not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is subpar but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly overthetop but that is true for many lowerbudget moviesbr br the aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that 9095 of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 510 seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of films 24 frames per second im not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didnt have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why anyway but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to lookbr br anyway ive definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldnt say that i enjoyed this movie and i cant recommend that anyone see it
