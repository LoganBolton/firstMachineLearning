this was a cute movie at first then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs at bestbr br there is too much king james english spoken with is not only annoying in todays world but not always easy to interpret can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film forget itbr br bing crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as hank martin rhonda fleming alisande la carteloise was too in addition to her good looks and beautiful long red hair br br its a nice movie with a feelgood ending and i cant knock that maybe this is worthy of a rental for historical sake or if youre a big crosby fan but overall its not that much
