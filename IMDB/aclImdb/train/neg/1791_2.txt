whats with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie its like someone put muddy water on the camera lensbr br the violence and nudity might turn some people off but that along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i supposebr br my favorite line is delivered by tarquin the vampire alas your breed is dumb okay no one should ever say alas in a movie line unless theyre english and living in the 18th centurybr br the acting by the van helsing character and bad girl rally isnt bad i also liked master little played by ron little wicked martial arts dont take it too seriously and youll enjoy it
