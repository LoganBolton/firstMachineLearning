allow me to start this review by saying this i love vampire movies they can suck har har pun intended and ill still love them because vampires are just cool in movies van helsing considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires you may ask what does that have to do with this movie the answer is that i intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is that even a sucker harharhar for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so muchbr br the movie stars van helsing a college professor guy who isnt at all convincing hes a terrible actor like everyone else in this movie and he wrote it to add salt to the wound i honestly to not mean to offend him and im sure everyone had fun making this movie but watching it was actually painful im not sure why i watched the whole thing perhaps it was a morbid fascination like watching an impending train crash its horrible but you cant manage to force yourself to look away its main fault is that its just so ing boring and its plot is so damn ridiculous even for a science fiction horror moviebr br but i digress by the way van helsing has sex with his mom of course he doesnt know its her at the time he just thinks its one of his students which is still illegal and all but not as disgusting and creepybr br if i were van helsing i would at least pull an oedipus myself when i found out i had done something so gross it wouldve made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it but no the point isnt even brought up at all by any of the characters its as if the writer didnt even think of it i wouldve at least had another character laugh at him and say ha ha you had sex with your mom which would be mildly humorous although blatantly immature im probably running out of room so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film theres a vampire ninja fight with an old man it would be funny but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously its not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is stay far far away from it if you value your time at allbr br i will say one thing positive about the movie the guy who plays van helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his theres like a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks it would be boring in any other movie but here sadly it was the highlight
