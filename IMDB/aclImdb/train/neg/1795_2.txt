i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the postscreening survey i felt the films biggest problem was its lack of a main plot instead it was composed of too many subplots competing for screen time as a result there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment what the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters in fact any one subplot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining subplots and characters simply put the hungry bachelors clubs plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired
