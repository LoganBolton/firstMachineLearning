antonioni by making this film had assumed the role of papa smurf to all the little longhaired american radical studentsmurfs he had taken them under the guiding protection of his european communist wings showing appreciation and support for their confused american ways these smurfs are red and wear blue not the other way around the radical smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the god of all longhaired smurfs lenin the communist  another wise old man whose beard made the smurfs take him even more seriously for it symbolized something wise though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them castro another wise bearded man has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers not to mention che guevara that beard has a certain jenesaispasquoi about it makes one want to immediately embrace marx and his lovely pacifistic teachings the film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word confused as confused as a blindfolded dog falling of a highstory building into a bottomless pit suddenly the movies hero well antonionis hero rises up and says something to his pathetic leftwing peers and then leaves hoping that this display of megacoolness will improve his james dean image and vastly increase his chances of getting laid with the best chicks in the next mass hippie orgy eventually he gets into trouble with cops ie pigs at a rally and spends the movie under the blue american capitalist skies looking for freedom or something like thatbr br antonionis predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow but has or had nothing new to offer its just the same old triggerhappy onedimensional cops businessmen discussing business deals and whats wrong with that isnt that how antonionis movies get made and endless shots of tv commercials and billboards advertising the ohso morally decadent products for the abhorrent selfish and greedy rightwing rabblepopulation who thinks of no one but themselves their families their work and their childrenbr br papa smurf antonioni just like his longhaired smurfs and smurfettes of the late 60s failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their antiestablishment opinions freely within that very establishment whereas the students in those countries whose leftwing systems they admired did not and still do not by far the greatest irony about the hippies  and antonioni naturally failed to realize this as well his judgment being clouded by cocainesnorting and an excessive intake of lsd  is that hippies were are the garbageresidue of capitalism this is an incredible irony only in a successfullyfunctioning capitalist system can you find that species called hippie a spoiled ungrateful and selfish bunch of middle and uppermiddle class losersbr br the film itself seems to go on forever antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it while including overlong scenes of pointlessness with a high dullness factor his attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite his statements are highly dubious at best this film is antonionis way of saying that violent revolution is the solution and this is what we get from an old saturated filthyrich fat filmmaker who lives in villas and dines in the best french and italian restaurantsbr br i dont remember seeing any major western movie about the tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in china but when one western student gets shot for waving che guevaras face into all our faces we get ten major films about it at once i suppose this means that a chinese life is worth a thousand times less than a western one  at least to the leftwing hypocrites who infest moviesbr br if youre a marxist neohippy and disliked this awful review please klick no below
