this film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context it is an incredibly stupid movie heck even seen in its proper context its pretty bad mostly this is due to a silly plot and very selfindulgent direction by the famed italian director michelangelo antonioni in this case he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an antiestablishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportionsbr br the film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such platitudes as power to the people and complaining about the man considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon a bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed our hero mark may or may not have done it but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution instead of heading to mexico or canada he does what only a total moron would dosteals an airplane and flies it to the mojave desert there he meets a happen chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours then they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history as they gyrate about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene while you see a bit of skin warranting an rrating its not as explicit as it could have been in fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind and of course when they are finished the many many other couples vanish into thin airbr br oddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a peter max creation despite improving the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary when the girl finds out she goes into a semicatatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times then inexplicably you see tvs refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion while dumb it is rather cool to watchsort of like when david letterman blows things up or smashes things on his showbr br aside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing at least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bitespecially since there really isnt all that much plot or dialog the bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and i was not surprised to see it listed in the fifty worst films book by harry medved its a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap for such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crimebr br two final observations if you like laughing at silly hippie movies also try watching the trial of billy jack also in a case of art imitating life the lead mark frechette acted out his character in real life he died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person dang hippies
