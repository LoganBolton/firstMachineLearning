i admit having come of age in the hippiedippy age i am a sucker for these kind of movies i can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most normal people however this movie is simply awful in every conceivable waybr br every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as gospel cops kill a young long hair when he peacefully lands a plane this movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excesses of the hippie drone it is like a left wing version of dragnet except without professional actors the only reason i gave it two stars was because there are some obscurities of interest on the soundtrack besides i couldnt find a selection for negative starsbr br no actors almost no plot sheeze barely even a scriptyou got it an art movieall this done at root canal drilling slowness dragging out each meaningless scene just to fill up timebr br in a bizarre twist of life imitating art the star nonactor of the movie joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in boston one of his corobbers was killed and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting accidentand just think he got to leave this behind as a legacyoy vey
