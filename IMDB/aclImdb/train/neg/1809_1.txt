theres nothing i hate more than selfcongratulating pretentiousness kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middleclass whiner to make a movie about why they cant get laid i dont really mind inexperience and lowbudget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes the money put into this couldve gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager if you watch project greenlight youll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesnt manage to say anything really at all when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world the revolution cant come soon enough go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits thank you and good day
