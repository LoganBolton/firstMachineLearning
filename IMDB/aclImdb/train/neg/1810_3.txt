think of this film as a saturday morning liveaction program from ages ago even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses i cant fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department too many warriorwizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings and who in the world wouldve let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place i thought this was a family movie mst3k heres another fine gem for your 1999 tv season
