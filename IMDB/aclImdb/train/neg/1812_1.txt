go immediately and rent this movie it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust no one will have touched it in years it may even be a 50 special its worth ten bucks i swear buy it there arent very many films than can compare with this  the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years yes i gave it a 1 but it really deserves much lower 110 scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind
