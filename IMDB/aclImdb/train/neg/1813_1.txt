if somebody wants to make a really really bad movie wizards of the lost kingdom really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badnessbr br start with the pseudochewbacca that follows around the main character  some poor schmuck in a baggy white furry costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting work your way slowly painfully through more notsospecial effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief add a garden gnome just for the heck of itbr br on second thought skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half
