from the start you know this is a sam sherman film more than an al adamson film because as the credits roll a sam sherman production appears in letters as big as the title credit not only that mr sherman cowrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use bob livingstone a washedup 69 year old western star of the old hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of swinging stewardesses br br now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a softcore exploitation feature it defies explanation but that is sam sherman for you his obsession with old hollywood colored a lot of his films for independent international pictures and he and al adamson frequently tried to get hasbeen actors for their films eg j carrol naish russ tamblyn lon chaney jretc but bob livingstone tell me the drivein demographic knew who this 40s secondrater was its ridiculous br br but then again naughty stewardesses was a successful picture for them so we cant just write this off as a sherman fiasco still by any aesthetic standard its an incoherent mess al adamson wanted out of this picture and it is easy to see why first off it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core tits and asssimulated sex only to a kidnapping thriller shades of stecklers rat pfink and boo boo in between we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around vegas to the hackneyed music of sparrow or richard smedley and connie hoffmann on a photo shoot in san francisco worst of all we get bob livingstone as a jack lalanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexygag thankfully his big sex scene with connie hoffmann was deleted but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the dvd in the special features section creepy br br this is a terrible terrible movie but ill give it three stars for gary gravers photography and out of sympathy to connie hoffmann for having to make it with wrinkles livingstone naughty stewardesses is for al adamson completists andor scholars of exploitation film as sam shermans commentary offers vital inside info all others beware
