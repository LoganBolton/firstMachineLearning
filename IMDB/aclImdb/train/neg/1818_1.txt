connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at timesbr br thats it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or notbr br these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness flared trousers big hair zapata moustaches etc this one isntbr br the script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally badbr br the title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly misleadingbr br i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague
