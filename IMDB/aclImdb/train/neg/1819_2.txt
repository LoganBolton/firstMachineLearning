i sought out this film for one reasonal adamson he is among the worst directors of all timeright up there with ed wood jr and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness however i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies because of that this film wasnt particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fansbr br now i was wary about watching this film as the title naughty stewardesses makes the film sound like a pornographic filmsomething i wouldnt be reviewing on imdb however this film appeared to be this at timesparticularly the first 10 minutes but you could tell that the script underwent many changes as for much of the film there isnt any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy the result of all this is total confusionbr br sadly none of the many parts are even good for example as a porn video it shows surprisingly little and its incomprehensible why they would put a 71 yearold guy in some of the love scenes sure for a 71 yearold mr livingston looked pretty goodbut he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet then when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent as livingston became a rambolike guy talk about weird and inappropriatebr br overall there is little to recommend this sad movie its not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like naughty stewardesses
