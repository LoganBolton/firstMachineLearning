ah channel 5 of local mexican tv everyday at 200 am they air horror movies from the 70s to early 2000s it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching itbr br the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the wordbr br the movie at some points looks like a soapopera because of its absurd dialogs cinematography and directionbr br my advice is  avoid this one at all costs its a movie that it shouldnt be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre filmmakingbr br you have been warned
