such is the dilemmaabove that debbie must face at the close of this sam sherman production naughty stewardesses debbie has just hit town become a stewardess slept with an elderly rich manwho she describes is in his 50s but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met and then is the central element to a kidnappingextortion plot through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soulsearching what in heavens name will debbie do well i cannot give it away completely but dont expect any real epiphany here lets face it naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to beat least twothirds through a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70s way film there is no grand art here the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes by todays standards the film is pretty tame what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end cmon anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand it didnt make sense to me so how on earth did these characters dig it anyone buying cal as a member of the plosomething like that or even as a director for hardcore pornography he would be luck to get work at seven eleven this is as another reviewer noted more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece you can tell when al is in complete charge there is virtually no budget and the film doesnt look nearly as polished as this adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be it has a certain style to it i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs i even liked the music of sparrow silver heels was a somewhat catchy tune the movie doesnt look cheap really at all compare that to any of als horror films as for the cast yes bob livingston is a bit old for the lead but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role the girls have all got great sets so what else was required of them huh naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70s and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade by the way did i mention it is a pretty bad picture
