i do not envy barry levinson rachel weisz ben stiller or jack black for doing this film its in one word boring maybe the fact that is too predictable the morethanexploited ben stillers loser role or the notatall funny scenes make this film just something to forget even christopher walkens appearance finishes in a pathetic way i was very disappointed i love ben stillers acting i loved it in most of his films the last one i saw before this was duplex with drew barrymore and was not that bad about jack black well apart from high fidelity ive never seen him doing something good what about school of rock ooops frightening
