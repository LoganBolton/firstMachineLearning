im not sure what i just couldnt laugh at it i had an open mind i didnt want to be a tightss about it but i seriously just couldnt laugh at this film it was just not funny to me some parts it seemed like ben stiller and jack black tried too hard just because you put two very funny men together doesnt mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy some movies just shouldnt be made this is one of them because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid i know i know its a comedy sort of at least but i was just not impressed im sorry but i cannot give this anything lower than a two and thats all im giving br br 210
