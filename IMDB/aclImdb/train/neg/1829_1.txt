stupid stupid stupid i can not stand ben stiller anymore how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me i cant understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie id get fired and i own the companyi would have to fire myself god this movie was just a plain steaming stinking pile of poo that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible something else i have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary
