i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i dont really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull contenttopic and its not really funnybr br although the acting is generally good its not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black dont show all their talent in this moviebr br so if youre about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely dont go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see im not the only one with this opinion because even jack black apologized for it take a look at trivia
