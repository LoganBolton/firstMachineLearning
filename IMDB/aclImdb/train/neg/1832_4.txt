it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies  especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black  have been situation spoofs which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs i found the sheer absurdity of zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released starsky and hutch was also enjoyable and then dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people although personally i was a bit tired of the overthetop characters  especially when the scenario wasnt quite so funny perhaps the comedy of a dodgeball tournament doesnt quite translate to australia where its rarely played so in an attempt to do something a little more original envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of jack blacks character i wont spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie the problem is that the movie seems to drag im not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before  and very rarely successfully so instead of a nice crisp enjoyable and fresh comedy you get a film that seems to just go through the motions sure the motions can be quite amusing and theyre centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs  especially with jack black playing the excited and amusing though a bit 2d creator ben stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost hes asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his zoolander breed of movies but he struggles as a family man whether his fault or the scripts there isnt enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of ben stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious the performance doesnt leave an imprint on the viewer hes just ben stiller jack black manages to actually portray a character  though not a challenging one the last annoying element of the movie is christopher walkens role as the j man which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quicklybr br its really not as unbearable as some people would have you think its watchable especially if youre in the right mood feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after youve watched a scary film and feel like something light  hopefully youll also be somewhat tipsy by then too in that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along
