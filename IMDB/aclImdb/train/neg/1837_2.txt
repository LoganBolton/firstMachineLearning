i admit to liking a lot of the socalled fratpack movies no matter how bad they are i can find something to like about ben stiller or owen wilson or vince vaughn or will ferrell or jack black but envy just left me about as cold as the white horse that ben disposed of this time its ben and jack black as a couple of nutty neighbors one of whom black discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other stiller writhes in envy thats supposedly the plot but then it veers off in other directions that dont really make much sensebr br i guess the vapoorize thing is sort of amusing at first the problem is they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture black has a license plate that reads caca king and it gets fairly tiresome but even ben and jack are used poorly the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down the two best performances by far are rachel weisz and chris walken walkens neohippiedippie guy is so offbeat and so wellmodulated a performance that it really never suggests any of walkens other familiar nutcase characters its completely unique yet comes across as unmistakably walken and weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about even with limited screen time she still dominates every scene shes inbr br the whole crux of the socalled drama is that ben in a jealous drunken stupor accidentally shoots jacks prize white stallion and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead but the plot twist isnt believable because theres nothing about jacks character to indicate that he would do such a thing he plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void you discount it completely its all filler and whats the point of the outofcontrol merrygoround except that barry levinson wants us to know that hes seen strangers on a train the screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed someone with levinsons track record should know better maybe someone will invent something to make this film disappear oh wait they already have
