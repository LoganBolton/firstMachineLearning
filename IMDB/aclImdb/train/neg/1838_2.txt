envy is bad for a number of reasons yes there are unlikeable characters thats not the problem it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all the war of the roses featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate whereas in envy the introduction is thin the characters are never believable and the plot only makes things worsebr br ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and im a fan of his work most of the time stiller campaigned to have this released straighttovideo and now i can see why the movie proposes that hes best friends with jack black but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black i thought this would develop into some sort of onesided relationship a la the cable guy but it never does instead stiller insists hes his best friend and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like well poo the movies plot is ridiculous but it doesnt matter because its supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale unfortunately the message is lost in the mess walken gives a good performance but black is offkey and annoying and i usually find him very funny no its not a horrible film but i still cant believe barry levinson rain man sleepers is responsible for this  its not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better i wish vapoorize did exist  so we could make this film disappear forever
