this has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy ive ever seen in my life ben stiller jack black and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man cant make me laugh somethings got to be wrong with this picture this is the only movie ive ever felt like walking out of i used free passes and still felt like i wanted my money back i can wholeheartedly say that the only movie ive ever seen worse than this one was house of the dead the only worse movie i laughed very slightly at the merrygoround scene and thats it spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right i dont know i guess the filmmakers thought that flan was a funny word or something and the other running joke really is beating a dead horseliterally
