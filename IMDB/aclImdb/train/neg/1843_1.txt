wow simply awful i was a fan of the original movie and begrudgingly sat through part 2 3 was and improvement 45 and freddys dead were pretty bad but nothing is as bad as freddys nightmares freddy acts as a rod serlingesq host of this anthology seriesbr br i can accept how freddy became one punchline after another but at least in the movies the appeal of freddy carried the movies but here these were so poorly made they looked like high school productions of a horror series the poor actors if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for im nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors ones just starting on the hollywood ladder brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week or seasoned actors on their way down the hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last weekbr br i half expected dana plato to guest star but she was already dead by the time this was in productionbr br to paraphrase nancys line in the original elm stwhat ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this
