this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness its watchable and rather funny i dont think the filmmakers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality its just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as its the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on its own this film is really stupid but its funny the killings are hilariousi wouldnt advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked goodbut if it happens to be on tv one night and youre up for a laugh then stick it on
