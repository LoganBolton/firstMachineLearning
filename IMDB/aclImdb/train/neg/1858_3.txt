a serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into frosty the snowmans evil twin then goes on a killing spree interesting plot sounds scary and it is scary if youre five years old otherwise its kind of cheesy i saw it on cable and im glad i didnt pay money to see it it has all the charm and style of a lowbudget movie which may become a cult film im sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere im just not in it even though i didnt like the movie as a whole there were some scenes i found amusing such as the bathtub scene and the postexplosion scene with the picasso reference it was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill jack and he just doesnt seem to want to die in short jack frost is a good lowbudget bmovie comedy but a bad lowbudget bmovie horror
