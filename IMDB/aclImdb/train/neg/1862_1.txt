its not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turnoff for bored audiences its the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch im sorry but i do not see the fun in this just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid oneliners well im wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound oops did i forget to mention this sheriffs not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh i guess he kind of forgot when he won a notsothrilling victory over the snowman
