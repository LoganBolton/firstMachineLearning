well what can i say there are bgrade movies and there are bgrade movies and this definitely falls into the latter however since its obvious that even the makers of the film know that its not a credible movie take a look at the closing credits it can be forgivenbr br the plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed he accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow the killer now takes on the form of a snowman  if you can believe that the snowman jack frost is after the country town sherif who put him behind bars in doing so jack frost ends up killing half the townbr br this movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the bgrade movies of the 50s this alone makes it worth watching for a laugh a movie to pass the time away
