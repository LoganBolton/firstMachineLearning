veteran sleazeball bruno mattei is at it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes joel schumachers 8mm but as expected mattei does his movie on a minuscule budget  so that it already looks obscure when its newly releasedbr br after her daughter gets abducted a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that direct snuff films as long as the exclusive clients pay well the search for her daughter does not only lead the mother across europe but also into prostitution she goes to bed with some guys to get her clues when she finally reaches contact with the snuff organization lead by the mysterious doctor hades shes getting into great danger herselfbr br there is not much good to say about this one even though it starts promising problem is that the movie is by far not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like blade violent snuff trap which was first released in russia is neither gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewers attention the plot isnt that special either except maybe for the surprisingly many different locations throughout europe the ending is hugely disappointing the acting isnt really remarkable either except for anita auer who plays doctor hades she looks and acts extremely creepy you dont want to meet her like this in a dark alley or your bedroom for that matterbr br all in all snuff trap only appeals to collectors of bruno matteis films but its good to see the man back on the helm again it was his first thriller since 1994s giallo gli occhi dentro
