i didnt know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukonbr br ill leave it to pierre berton noted historian born and raised in dawson city yukon and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush klondike the last great gold rush 18961899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie br br the american idea of an untamed frontier subdued by individual heroes armed with sixguns was continued in the far country another story about a cowboy from the american west  wyoming this time  driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns  that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle the customs shack is emptybr br where is the constable asks brennanbr br up on the pelly river trouble with the chilkats someone replies hes got a real tough job that constable he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles sometimes he dont get home for two or three months at a time br br the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense they collected customs duties often over the wails of the new arrivals made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation and turned men back if they didnt have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad in true canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community in dawson the lords day act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqué performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tightsbr br in such a community a gunbelt was unthinkable one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over no man has yet taken a gun away from me said the american well im taking it the constable said mildly and did so without further resistance so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiecebr br in 1898 the big year of the stampede there wasnt a serious crime  let alone a murder  in dawson the contrast with skagway on the american side which was a lawless town run by soapy smith the denver confidence man was remarkable but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law which a soapy smith character from skagway  he is called gannon in the picture  can easily control in real life one of smiths men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeantbr br in the movie the lone mountie says yes im the law i represent the law in the yukon territory about fifty thousand square miles of itbr br then why arent there more of youbr br because yesterday this was a wilderness we didnt expect you to pour in by the thousands now that youre here well protect youbr br whenbr br therell be a post established here in dawson early in maybr br what happens between now and may you going to be here to keep orderbr br part of the timebr br what about the rest of the timebr br pick yourselves a good man swear him in have him act as marshalbr br the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture his astonishing suggestion  that an american town marshal complete with tin star be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence  is accepted naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot and he does others get shot even walter brennan gets shot stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own he pins on the tin star and he and the bully gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climaxbr br to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north this bald retelling of the story passes rational belief br br excerpt from hollywoods canada by pierre berton 1975
