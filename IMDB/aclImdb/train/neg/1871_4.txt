despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch the murdermystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed its obviously a precode film because the girls often wear very little clothing and theres even a song singing the praises of marijuana the performances are all onenote although its nice to see carl brisson in a musical but when victor mclaglen as the police lieutenent lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues you may want to throw in the towel or at least fastforward to the next number pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though
