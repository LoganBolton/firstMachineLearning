you must be kidding lets entertain the possibility that parker posey is really an actress and not just some entry in the quirk of the month club of actors really unless this is meant to be a tongueincheek satire on david mamet terse confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone think ben stein blandnessor a flat out dry comedy this film has got to be in the running for a rotten tomato awardor worsebr br as if the stiff and uncomfortable posey werent enough weve got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable jeff goldblum theres more wood in this film than a toothpick factorybr br adding to this already bizarre casting are several other roles all populated by forgettable actors who look or sound like escapees from americas next top model don pardo or even the kid who pronounces the word been like bean which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film we are analyzing his accent to guess if hes canadian or not i think i laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of alarik jans music for mamets the house of games if taken as a spoof the film is almost droll if taken seriously just a selfconscious piece of drek
