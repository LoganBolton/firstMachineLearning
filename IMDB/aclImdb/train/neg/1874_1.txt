i have been a fervent hal hartley supporter since i saw his short surviving desire in high school and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant henry fool but this 10yearlater sequel is not only unnecessary its disgracefulbr br after a choppy and expeditious start fay grim devolves into pseudointellectualism flat out boredom and finally unwarranted  and unwanted  nihilism and thats just the plotbr br the majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorlydeveloped as the movie one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous henry fool himself and its his only spoken scene in the filmbr br jeff goldblums agent fulbright it seems is the only bright character a pun surely intended by hartley as well how then is he left spoiler dead via a car bombing easily making this the gentlenatured hartleys most violent film to date and tonally all wrong in a film thats already all wrong from the word gobr br as for the other new characters angus james ned fool or is it grim not to mention fay herself well i wont spoil their fates as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own when it isnt busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle which gives the disconcerting impression that hartley is moving backwards from auteur to crappy film studentbr br this piece is a complete disaster a dreadful mess that isnt even goodhumored enough to revel in its messiness instead it selfindulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the real world one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say in doing so hartley tracks sht all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for thembr br i have rarely been so depressed at the movies and im counting leaving las vegas which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them instead of immediately disregarding characters already belovedbr br grim indeed
