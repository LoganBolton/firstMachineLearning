first off i really loved henry fool which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers parker posey is one of best actresses onscreen today but this film was a fullout travesty watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras  so full of pride and making pointless analogies to star wars  was stomachturning this was hype on the producers part hdnet realized to the max a true example of the emperor and his new clothes mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever i dont think i can ever see it again in its pure innocent lightbr br remember hal you can fool some of the people some of the time etc the director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage sadly its a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation the story must be exciting and active or its boxoffice hopes are dim indeed never mind a decent story for the actors it was like trying to act in a straitjacketbr br the score i believe hartleys is tasteless with drum hits walking all over dialog there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smilebr br when i saw the trailer i thought oh theyre just trying to grab a new audience but its really this ridiculous ride id be happy to spoil this movie for you but its been done its rotten the fool franchise is dead long live henry fool
