this is a lowbudget spoof of the espionage genre to help frame your expectations you should know that 1 the acting is wildly heavyhanded the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and offkey pacing 2 the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 shots are frequently framed in offbalance angles poking fun at genre excesses 4 a popeyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic mannerbr br the film has a guiding intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the bfilms of the 1930s a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan the films overthetop acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes in an early running gag fay grims son ned is so frequently told to leave that you cant help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad parker poseys nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the filmbr br the films slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge the films impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy moreover it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic the musical score is intentionally heavy handed and i found this and the offkilter camera angles more irritating than humorousbr br the overthetop acting the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiraciescounter conspiracies and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers the movie is much too long at 158 minutesbr br that said fans who are receptive to the films sarcasm might want to watch again  using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavyhanded than lighthearted but the comedy may well appeal to your tastes the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films fans of director hal harley or devotees of parker posey who has the most camera time
