i havent seen henry fool but after watching fay grim im not sure i want to maybe hartley aims to be the antithriller directorhe sure succeeded with this yawner based on the official descriptionwoman discovers that her dead husbands manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national securityi expected a taut geopolitical drama instead i got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time i can hang for a long time with a frustrating hardtofollow plot eg duplicity because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together even when they dont or they do but they leave lingering questions eg duplicity sharp writing and acting can hold ones interest but halfway through fay grim i reached a deadly realizationi didnt know what was going on and i didnt care too bad because i really like parker posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists theres also bad casting jeff goldblum can be very good but hes not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it his cia sidekick is worse he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of american idol are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads then theres the sticky question of the characters ages goldblum was 54 when he made fay grim thomas jay ryan who plays henry fool was 44 neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages yet a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua back in the 70s goldblums character wouldve been in his 20s then henry fool wouldve been a teenager was hartley being quirky or lazy the problems are too numerous to list
