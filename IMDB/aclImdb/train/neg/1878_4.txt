i say id figure in that line because frankly ive not seen a hal hartley movie until now its not that i havent heard of him though as he was seen as one of those small ny filmmakers when i say small i mean even smaller than jim jarmusch who made ultrapersonal projects on limited budgets in an ironic way much as with pasolinis salo though in a slightly different context fay grim interests me to see some of hartleys more acclaimed features because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it as if hartley could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good hes just taken a big experimental blunder or on the other hand he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and wouldbe godardlike cinematic collisionsbr br i cant quite explain the story which may or may not be a problem i suppose however its not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded fay grim henry fool i think even if i had that experience it wouldnt make too much of a difference based on the final results theres a lot of international espionage a double plot wrapped inside of another thats fallen through the fake pockets of the title character played in an aloof way by parker posey not sure if thats good or bad either maybe both and also involving a cia operative jeff goldblum as usual a solid presence amid the mania even conjuring some laughs not to mention an orgyladen picture box and author henry fool its not that the script is totally impenetrable however much it goes into overextended loopholes just for the sake of it because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialogbr br quite simply the direction just sucks harltey is in love with the third man which is fine but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle with characters having to get into frame equally oddly not since battlefield earth in fact has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect only this time hartley isnt amid a clusterf hes mostly responsible for it this along with the crazy wannabe godard titlecards that pop in here and there some a little amusing and some just totally stupid and the montage segments all in still shots and a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind ed wood undermine any of the potential that is in the script which is already fairly hard to decipher in a way its fascinating to watch how bad this all goes but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flipside to total creative control on a sortof smallscale storybr br but let it be known youll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of american independent filmmaking this year
