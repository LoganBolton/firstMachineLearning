its hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesnt go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffledbr br it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum  the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment br br sorry i couldnt pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters personalities its all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequelbr br im switching this off now  henry in some sort of jail with a taliban
