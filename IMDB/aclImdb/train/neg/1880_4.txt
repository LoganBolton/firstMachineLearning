despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers movies it wasnt until about 6 years ago that i first saw follow the fleet i knew all the songs from an old astairerogers record yes vinyl but knew nothing of the plotbr br unfortunately while the songs are catchy and ginger rogers character is sweet and funny you just cant like bake baker while trying to make up to his longtime partner he continually sabotages her career his character doesnt have the usual humour and elan of the other films astaire charactersbr br worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers
