what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes its arty and yes its foreign but  thats not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly madebr br the people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they dont have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for thembr br the violence and some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous its like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him eitherbr br and oh yes if i had neighbours like these id move
