earlier today i got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which i encountered a curious statement the character development in newer movies just isnt nearly as good or interesting as it used to be depending on the films in question this can be attributed to a number of things sometimes generic special effects and plotdriven hollywood garbage like war of the worlds but in the case of overthetop uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put art back into cinema its movies like dog days that are to blamebr br i normally have a very high tolerance for movies no matter how dull or pointless i find them ranging from good long ones like andrei rublev and dogville to ones ive considered painful to sit through a la alpha dog and wild wild west i shut this movie off 45 minutes in which is 30 minutes more than i actually should have i wasnt interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism in an attempt to say something about the dregs of society this film too easily falls into being selfindulgent trite and exploitative in a very sincere sense granted ive seen many disturbing movies on the same subject but there are so many better films out there about depressing pathetic people happiness gummo kids salo storytelling irreversible that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality dog days had none more than an eighth graders distaste for society choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are and instead choosing to be a dull awful and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art this isnt a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society its just boring and nothing worth caring about
