although theres flying guillotines as part of the title of this movie it has no connections to the original flying guillotines 1975 and its sequel flying guillotines ii 1978 the two originals are masterpieces of kungfu movie and still stands out as a classic this is a much inferior copy of the original and even as a regular kungfu movie its below averagebr br first of all this movie doesnt have much acting its one senseless fight scene after another and flying guillotine doesnt even play a major part in them story is about some shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains whove took off with a sacred book and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot the same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on thembr br there are four movies with flying guillotine as part of its title this in my opinion is of least quality the design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other threebr br the movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production br br best skip this and watch the two originals
