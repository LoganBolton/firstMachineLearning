1975s master of the flying guillotine is an amazing and wonderful film to watch this isnt because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all its because the film is so silly and so overthetop that it is a camp classicbad but enjoyably bad the film stars a blind guy who has a frisbeelike device on a chain that chops off peoples heads as he expertly throws this at his foes who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papiermache arms or that the guy was blind its just a ball to watch from start to finishand one of my favorite bad films and great to see with friendsbr br because of this film i was eager to see the fatal flying guillotines 1977 though sadly it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a knockofftaking many of the ideas from the original but neglecting to make the film as coherent or watchable sure its silly fun but it never comes close to master of the flying guillotine in entertainment value like the original film there are these weird flying devices that sever heads but they are quite differentwith circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own there also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly whats occurring in this englishdubbed version as the plot is completely incomprehensible however at the same time some of the martial arts action is very good while not up to the high standards of most bruce lee or sonny chiba films the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plotbr br overall this is a film that martial arts fans may like despite its many many many many shortcomings but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous but most importantly it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as master of the flying guillotine too bad
