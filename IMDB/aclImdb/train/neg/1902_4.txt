warning review contains slight spoilersbr br theres a parallel universe out there where gone in 60 seconds is a dark edgy controversial independent movie unfortunately in this dimension gone is a flashy vacuous testosteronefuelled moronfest starring nicolas cagebr br for reasons not really worth getting into he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars only one of which has an alarm this crew consists of the guy with the funnyshaped ears whos rumoured to be the new superman a guy who conducted electricity in the xfiles an exprofessional footballer and two token black menbr br their enemies are cops rival car thieves and bilborough from cracker his manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for american audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since daphne in frasier theres also angelina jolie who gets no character save to be a receptacle to mens sexual desires she and cage are supposed to be old flames which is odd as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the films overlong 135m running timebr br in fact characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a moment a violin plays in the background to accentuate the emotion its no spoiler to reveal that vinnie jones who recreates his famous paul gasgoine hand ball manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent only gets one line not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the films dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny allegedly after he struggles through it in his notquiteactingbutitlldo london drawl cage quips i always thought you were from long island my ribs as you might imagine were well and truly tickledbr br in fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters this sees the biggest aspect of hollywood take hold why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it the younger man who like the elder jivetalks for the whole duration proclaims us black people dont like the cold  were tropical people he then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch roots he is of course parodying the image of black people but how funny is that his older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself and thereby his colour in third person my black ass this my black ass that does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that thought notbr br the films soundtrack is played almost nonstop and with increasing volume some of the tracks  especially apollo 440s dont stop the rock  so loud theyre actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue the surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together no background music concept here its the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast keep that music down young manbr br this isnt the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it its just that its predictable lazy and witless with minimal effort in its construction apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie after being forcefed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact
