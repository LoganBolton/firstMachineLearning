minor spoilers br br i am like many others a huge jerry bruckheimer fan so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front and the trailer coming by before mi2 expectations were rising a jerry bruckheimer production big cars nic cage and fresh from an oscar angelina jolie what can possibly go wrong a lot br br the script is neither funny which it tries really hard to be nor exciting you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and woohhaa youve got comedy i dont think so excitement is totally out of the picture first of all and this is probably said many times there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nics brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days next thing you know is that kip the brother is walking with nic in the streets again is this excitement think not then comes the best bit the romance between nic and angelina she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic do you have a girlfriend are you seeing anybody what went wrong etcbr br then theres only one sparkle of hope left the car chases theyre disappointing to say the least because the trailer made it look like it was full of them and theres only one a very long one caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement i really had trouble following the actionbr br so is it an action movie a thriller a romantic comedy  theres no need to decide just avoid this horrible mess ill give 3 out of 10 stars and i feel like im being generous
