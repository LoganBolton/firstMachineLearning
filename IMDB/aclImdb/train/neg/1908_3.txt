yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere this lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it once again we have an attractive straight hero who supposedly cant get any woman to be interested in him yeah right and were also presented with the sympathetic attractive gay friend who is actually a fat balding ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive even i didnt find him appealing and im a fat ugly old gay man but thankfully not balding whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script and truly awful direction mr sneedeker should be banned from filmdom but then hes no different than the countless other hacks working in hollyweed
