tv version of twister springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable my sister bought this at a walmart a few years back when it was released i saw it back then and thought it was okay later twister with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out or was it before i think it was 97 and did a better job overall but twister was more silly fun this is realistic with a message it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a lowbudget character studybr br john schneider and devon sawa hes the reason my sister bought it star and devon sawa who went on to wild america final destination and slackers got his big break here so in a way i was one of the first people to see him really take off i dont know if its an honor or a shame i havent seen how he acts in recent filmsbr br night of the twisters all depends on personal taste like i said it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters twisters or a lowbudget character study night of the twister has the latter so you decidebr br i give it a 255br br  john ulmer
