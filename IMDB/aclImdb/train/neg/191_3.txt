 to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th centurybr br a river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic standpoint great landscapes redford acting wellbr br unfortunately the story is bad if there is a story at allbr br i felt sorry for the narrator  author who is as dry narrowminded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also caged in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to undestand his brothers motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour  fun all there is is flyfishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his fatherbr br the end is not surprising it is forseeable from the very beginningbr br definitely not a mustsee 3  10br br
