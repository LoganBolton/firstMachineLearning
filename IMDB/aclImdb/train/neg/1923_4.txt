ironic that dr seuss fable emphasizing the noncommercialization of christmas should be one of the most hyped marketed and successful blockbusters of the holiday season the general gist of ron howards adaptation is that the grinchs bane against christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for cindy lou who played very well by taylor momsen this movie makes an ardent ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of seuss story but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jones animated version jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish grinch but whether its the dialogue the pacing or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly there are some wonderful visuals and the makeup work is amazing yet beyond the technical triumphs theres an element or two here thats missingbr br succinctnessbr br soulbr br or maybe jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25minute cartoon that howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long howard carey and crew are all very capable and talented but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product if you must see the featurelength version rent it on video with jones animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better i give this film three cans of whohash out of five
