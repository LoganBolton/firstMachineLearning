how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy i never did see the reason for a remake not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough whats the purpose of this film but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch i mean hes a great comedic actor but him as the grinch it just didnt make any sense to me his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable the whole story of the grinch and cindy louwho was over done and wasnt needed they actually just destroyed the story periodbr br all the whos in whoville are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly but cindy louwho is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that hes not going to get as good of a christmas as the other whos he kicks her out and decides that he doesnt want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the whos what his version of christmas is all about but soon he realizes that the whos may know that its a little bit more than what is the materialized version of christmasbr br how the grinch stole christmas wasnt needed and was a bit over the top i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version at least in my opinion the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done not to mention that how the grinch stole christmas was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmasbr br 110
