some have praised atlantisthe lost empire as a disney adventure for adults i dont think soat least not for thinking adultsbr br this script suggests a beginning as a liveaction movie that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older adventure movies has been done well before think the dirty dozen but atlantis represents one of the worse films in that motif the characters are weak even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best an mdmedicine man a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons if we have not at least seen these before we have seen mixandmatch quirks before the story about how one companion vinny played by don novello fr guido sarducci went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincingbr br only the main character milo thatch a young atlantisobsessed academic voiced by michael j fox has any depth to him milos search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his headbr br and while the characters were thin at best the best part about atlantis was the voice talent commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner although rourke is a pretty stock military type garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery garners vocal performance is the high point im sorry to say leonard nimoys dying king is nothing more than obligatory additionally don novello as the demolition expert vinny santorini was also notable for one or two welldone funny linesbut ive always liked father guido sarducci anywaybr br also well done was the computer animation the background animation that is the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter aside from landscapes buildings and vehicles there isnt much to impressbr br the plot was the worst some say hackneyed or trite im not so sure about that any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint so the treatment is the thing and atlantis obviously lacks thatbr br i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section the plot was bad the plots bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense to add to that the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppinessbr br  spoilers br br right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the coast of ireland should read the coast of iceland we begin to have problems the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as ireland and completely ignore the older latin term hibernia but more than this they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenlandbr br by making it the matter of a mistranliterated letter the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a postroman date on the script since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave and without visible clues and less technology than milo had made the inscription far less trustworthybr br the shepherds journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying in the kings eye it must have been written after the sinking but without even the technology that milos expedition had how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan so how could it know more about anything after that and why would it be written in atlantianbr br automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in atlantian so its got to be some sort automatic writing since noone left in atlantis can read it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface this would have made more sense but could also have been explained within the movie milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his lifeappeared in dreams etc this needed to be explored in the moviebr br the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages noone expects that the original indoeuropeans would be able to converse in europe anymore than romans would understand that hard cs or their day became french chs pronounced like shs no lessbr br current atlantians were alive before the cataclysmwhen apparently they could read yet now are unable to read what they used to or operate similar machinerybr br the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie nothing seems to have happened to this culture it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival noone wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracybr br kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set inbut any of it hardly qualifies her father for deification kashakims foolishness almost singlehandedly wiped his people from existence killed a bunch in the cataclysm stalled progress not a lot killed here but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody if they werent boiled in lava first because the giant robots werent there to protect thembr br a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakims likeness when kida tried joining her fathers image to the circle of great kings of atlantisbr br even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystalwhich he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or phases of the sun diagrambr br if milos grandfather had told rourke about it it still does not explain how rourke would have suffered from milos reading it as part of the book ripping out the pagewhich was dogeared in rourkes hand even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparentlyonly was there to tip off the viewer that something was not quite right unless the word crystal would have set alarms off in milos head that somebody would try to steal it milo would have suspected nothing its just thickheaded foreshadowingbr br the crews doublecross was not a character change we learned that vinny sweet audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning however the change of heart falls flat it was a change and needed to be better motivated hard to do with characters who werent given anything to begin withbr br niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from its liquid it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areasbr br the ending stinks and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness with its powersource restored atlantis is no longer a weak power needing coddling the giant robot guardians and the skycycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might the technology is superior to ours and definitely to early 20thcentury in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read for what the whole idea is to leave their little quiet chastened culture alone not to send it into hyperdrivebr br  end spoilers br br perhaps the lost world plot and the turnofthecentury setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps the failures i find with the film agree with this idea but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well and pulp stories is part of the crap they cant sell adults anymore anyway we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badnessbr br 4 out of 10the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot it seeps ever lower
