i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events thats precisely what happened with movies like et and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously dont waste your time  money on this one
