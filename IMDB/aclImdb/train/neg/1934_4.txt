follows the usual formula in putting a new recruit  this time the first africanamerican cuba gooding after president truman desegregates the armed forces  through the u s navys deepsea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot robert deniro if the program werent bad enough its got to be located in bayonne new jerseybr br theres nothing wrong with the performances robert de niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively cuba gooding raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south is the expectable paragon of rectitude the girls  one could hardly call them women  are charleze theron and lonette mckee they have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense other decent performers  powers boothe and hal holbrook  have even more perfunctory rolesbr br thats about it almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer a ship is called a boat robert de niro salutes indoors uncovered after a brutal assault on hospital personnel hes transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted somebody shouts im outta here in the early 1950s maybe it was a common expression at the time if so my bad people address each other by rank  lieutenant boatswains mate commander as they do in the army whereas in the navy they are simple mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted i didnt bother to check if there was a rank called senior master chief in 1950br br cuba gooding has a tough row to hoe everyone in the navy it seems hates negroes except for one guy from wisconsin he stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class its like the scene in animal house in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a sikh a black man and a blind kidbr br gooding is an enlisted man a second class petty officer he manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school in one of their arguments she pleads with him she just wants to be a doctor and he should join her quit the navy and lead a quiet life and just let life pass you by he retorts yes yes just be a doctors spouse and let life pass you by you can wave to it from the golf course in boca ratonbr br these kinds of flicks were common enough in world war ii bombardier airial gunner that sort of thing cheap as they often were they had some educational features you learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner here the technical details are skipped over perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except boyles law which we learned in highschool chemistrybr br i couldnt follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldnt exist if i got the mechanical problems right it was because i guessed correctly the direction is no help either the movie abounds in close ups so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had and the emergencies are confusing because theyre ill focusedbr br why go on want to see a better example of this kind of movie almost any will do  except maybe g i jane in which the abused hero is a heroin try the training camp scenes in the young lions there the victim is a jew or try from here to eternity in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on just like cool hand luke no easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easybr br thoroughly formulaic and not well done
