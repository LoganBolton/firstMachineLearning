spoiler warningbr br when the main characters sister is pushed down the stairs the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make it appear that shes been drinking but right before she is killed tells her sisters business partner teri garr on the phone that she hasnt had a drink in 4 days yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report and the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs huh really bad mistake in this movie which is pretty awful overall br br surprisingly bad considering the great cast some faults the writing isnt very good the music is madefortv bad and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie
