if you dont mind having your emotions toyed with then you wont mind this movie on the other hand if you enjoy british crime mysteries following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end youll be very disappointedbr br here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment br br  while the police utilize the cctv cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery the huge truck that stopped and blocked the childrens view just before her disappearance doesnt get caught on camera this is a critical piece of the mystery its inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mysterybr br  the movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the childrens movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from cameravisible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing cluesbr br  in england driving is on the left the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right several meters away from the flower kiosk when it could have easily parked immediately behind or even on the side as the huge truck didbr br  the police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime but cant find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfallbr br  search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and huntingbr br  it is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kioskbr br  it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential parkbr br  the suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slowdimwitted justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to selfincriminatebr br there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionados disappointment five days is a very weak british crime story
