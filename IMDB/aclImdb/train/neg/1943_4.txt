what a let down this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail but i was nevertheless gripped and kept watchingbr br david morrissey is always good value and he suranne jones were good leads the muslim aspects were very interesting we were tantalised with possible terrorist connectionsbr br but then morrisseys character was killed off and all the air left the balloon the last episode was dull dull dull the whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the d√©nouement was unbelievably feeblebr br five hours of my life for that my advice watch paint dry instead
