i thought whats new scoobydoo was pretty bad yes im sorry to say i didnt like it since hannabarbera didnt produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series when i heard shaggy and scoobydoo get a clue was in the works i thought it could be better but when i saw a pic of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear i knew this show was going to be bad if not worse i watched a few episodes and believe me it is just yet another teen titans or loonatics unleashedwannabe no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool creepy monsters that rob banks now they are going after a typical supervillain whom wants to destroy the world shaggy and scoobydoo have become more brave too also since shaggy is not going to be a vegetarian in this series casey kasem whom actually is a vegetarian the original voice of shaggy will not voice shaggy he will only voice shaggy if he doesnt eat meat and that was just a stupid corporatedone change to update the franchise as if the internet jokes werent enough so scott menville whom previously voiced red herring on a pup named scoobydoo voices shaggy here believe me the voice is really bad it makes shaggy sound like a squeaky 10yearold and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look however kasem does voice shaggys uncle albert which is a sort of good thing scoobydoo on the other hand does not look that well he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scoobydoo from the liveaction movies also scoobys frank welker voice need i mention brain the dog again still hasnt improved robi the robotic butler is practically worse than scrappydoo he tries to be funny and does comical impressions and gives safety tips remember kids dont stand under trees during a thunderstorm but it just doesnt fit into a scoobydoo cartoon again the hannabarbera sound effects are rarely used here however on one episode lightning strikes twice they use the castle thunder thunderclaps during it almost extensively although they do still use the newlyrecorded thunder sound effects too scoobydoo hasnt use castle thunder sound effects since 1991 but my question is why use castle thunder on shaggy and scoobydoo get a clue while not use it on the directtovideo movies or even on whats new scoobydoo two episodes of wnsd used it and it wasnt enough unfortunately if wnsd and the dtv movies used it then they might be better than this crappy cartoon the day this show premiered i watched the first episode and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes to get my mind off of this poor show i rented scoobydoo pirates ahoy which came out around the same time and you know what the pirates ahoy movie was actually better than shaggy and scoobydoo get a clue and even better than whats new scoobydoo and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isnt permanent to the franchise the directtovideo movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs thankfully but whether you loved or hated whats new scoobydoo i dont recommend it but if you hate the old series then youll love it oh god i hope the old scoobydoo cartoon stay better than this new  anyways like wnsd a really bad addition to the scooby canon
