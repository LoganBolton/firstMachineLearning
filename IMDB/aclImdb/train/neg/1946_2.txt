as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scoobybr br if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight nothing special saturday morning cartoon but that in essence is the problem it is in its current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the old scooby and gang im sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but im sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasnt it anything like the last serieswhere are youbr br scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this lets hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers
