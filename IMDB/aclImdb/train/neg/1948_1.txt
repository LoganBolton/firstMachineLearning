shaggy  scoobydoo get a clue its like watching a muchloved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness clearly the work of people with no soul no love or respect for the original work what in the name of all thats holy were they thinking of it seems they were trying to go all postmodern and ironic instead its just abysmal swill whats the point in taking up a successful franchise like scoobydoo if you just going to flush it down the toilet my son loves the original series  and even some of the spinoff movies  but he cant stand this drivel and lets face it you cant argue against the tastes of a seven yearold
