scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining scoobydoo and companybr br shaggys voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows theyve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the originalbr br im not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt following the formula used in any of the previous scooby showsbr br and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but its not real scoobydoo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might toobr br its worth a glance at  once  if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes well see how it looks after two more episodes  by then ill have formed a much more solid opinion
