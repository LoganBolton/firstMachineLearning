the first episode of this new show was on today and it was horrible not only did shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture but its so far away from the original concept and animation style that its barely recognizable as a scoobydoo showbr br even back in the dark days when fred and velma were gone and scoobys nephew scrappy was there the team still solved mysteries this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type supervillain and his henchmen while living in a mansion theres not even a van called the mystery machine and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease how can anyone take scooby doo and make this br br the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy and even then im being far too generous
