first lets get it out of the way   yeah this film steals a lot from darkness falls 2003 the plot for darkness falls goes something like this the tooth fairy a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge in the tooth fairy 2006 the disfigured tooth fairy who yeah hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone a little too similar to be coincidencebr br but what must be asked is this if youre going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie why choose something as mediocre as darkness falls sure it made a few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered a lowbudget straighttovideo movie will not have that same effect and it didntbr br as i watched the opening 1520 minutes of the film my expectations actually rose there seemed to be at least some production value the story didnt seem terrible just blatantly ripped off past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an exdoctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a busey and some hot veterinary student jenifer from argentos masters of horror jenifer after those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain it serves all the basic horrible clich√©s including but not limited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heartofgoldbr br one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience its kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time when the adults were on screen it had a more mature feel when star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to a more stupid err immature level when the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of are you afraid of the dark   only less scarybr br technically the film is all over the place the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring the writing is subpar as is the acting for the most part on the plus side theres some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene also if youre looking for a bit of the sexy stuff theres a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that other than that theres not much to bother with when it comes to this filmbr br if youre a huge fan of darkness falls do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way   but thats about the only reason i can find to see this onebr br final verdict 310 ap3
