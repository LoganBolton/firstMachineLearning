this movie has one redeeming feature at one point after a character is attacked by an axwielding fairy his brother asks him why is your dick over there chuck after suffering through almost an hour of bad film this almost made my drink come out my nosebr br some of the acting isnt too bad but the kids all stink and p j soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film the story is weak and nobody does what you think or what common sense dictates they shouldbr br of course there are a lot of story points that dont add up for example in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist a difficult feat since they apparently cant interact with physical matter however minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them apparently they can sometimes move matter and sometimes they cant go figurebr br lots of blood and guts thougha few nice boobs but this doesnt make up for the deficienciesbr br if you want a movie about the tooth fairy go rent darkness falls i think its great though a lot of other reviewers dont share my opinion at least it sets a mood
