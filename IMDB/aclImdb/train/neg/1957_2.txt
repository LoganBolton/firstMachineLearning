i was enjoying this movie most of the time but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a childrens movie i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then while filming decided to add in some blood nudity and language it was a big let down theres that believe the children magic that exists in movies like babe the pig or angels in the outfield that defeats the evil tooth fairy the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy when i bought this movie i thought it would be a bfilm response to the dreadful darkness falls somehow manage to make a better film with 14 of the money but they dont they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls
