i tried to finish this film three times but its god awful case in point mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfastmom stops for gas crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the bb try to rape her she escapes heads to bb and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts wowbr br other action logic deficits abound acting is also lukewarm and the next door neighbors warning is delivered in a really corny badly acted momentbr br moments of intense goredeath unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of timefiller interplay between charactersbr br less focus on gore more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated
