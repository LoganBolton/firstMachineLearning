the child actors were annoying also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes decent death scenes though if not for the death scenes this movie would have a very disneyish feel to itbr br the main child protagonist didnt seem nearly as scared as she should have been if i was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual you can bet your arse i wouldnt be out wandering around and riding my bikebr br overall ive seen worse ie it waits but its nothing i would watch again or recommend anyone bothering with it unless youre an avid horror collector
