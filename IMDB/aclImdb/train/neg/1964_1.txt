when i saw this movie cover the first thing i thought was that it was made for video the second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie darkness falls the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark unfortunately darkness falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage and this movie should not have been madebr br the film starts off with a small back story for the witch or more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth the opening is filmed poorly and like the rest of the movie its certainly not scary in present time the movie is about peter lochlyn munroe peters renting out his house and his exgirlfriend darcy chandra west and her daughter cole come to stay there cole meets a neighborhood child and they talk of the tooth fairy and how you shouldnt lose your tooth or shell come for you unfortunately seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out how ironic will cole survive the wrath of the tooth fairy and will her mother and peter be able to save her and rekindle their romancethis is a bad movie you could probably figure it outbr br one of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the tooth fairy is they say she kills you if you lose your tooth but nope shes more like a serial killer who kills at random and if you lose your tooth youre definitely going to go she steals a bike so apparently shes a thief too i said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on darkness falls but where did they get the inspiration for the tooth fairys appearance lets see she looks like a burn victim and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children hmmmits almost as though shes an exact ripoff of freddy krueger from the nightmare on elm street films and this is not the worst part of this awful mess the climax is this movie might have the most laughable climax not literally laughable because i found it more sickening than funny ive ever seen dont see thisbr br just a little trivia lochlyn munroe was in scary movie and jianna ballard was in scary movie 3 and they both were in this so apparently scary movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary moviesbr br my rating 12 out of  80 mins r for violence
