stephen j cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror the result dead above ground is an abysmal piece of junk now had i noticed his name in association with this particular film id have put it back but no i didnt have my glasses on and therefore i missed it damn i really do need to bring those with me while video shopping first question would be who the heck is the target audience for this its almost like a scary kids movie but then again theres topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there the main characters are so cute that you want to see someone anyone go after them with farm implements of some kind seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past a childmurdering witch that collected childrens teeth lived there probably something the real estate agent failed to mention of course now in the modern day theres a little girls ghost around to warn the reallive little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen it does and theres also two bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so theyre out for revenge too this whole thing has the feel of some madeforcable junk thats for the kids at halloween except for of course the things that arent suitable for little kids so not only is this mediocre its confused too a big boo and hiss to anchor bay for putting this out too considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low the uk gets a phantasm box set we get the tooth fairy hardly seems fair 1 out of 10 absolute garbage
