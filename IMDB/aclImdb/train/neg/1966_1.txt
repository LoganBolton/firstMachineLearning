i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i pod it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf bc i didnt want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie bc the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck bc its not until then the movie turns into a horror dont bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls
