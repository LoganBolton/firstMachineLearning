the tooth fairy is set in a small town somewhere in northern california where peter campbell lochlyn munro has brought a farming property which he is renovating  planning to turn into a holiday inn he is joined by his girlfriend darcy wagner chandra west  her young 12 year old daughter pamela nicole munoz who arrive to help for the weekend while exploring the property pamela meets another young girl named emma jianna ballard who warns her that evil lurks within her new home she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the tooth fairy who takes baby teeth from children  then kills them pamela is worried  becomes even more so when she falls off her bike  her last baby tooth falls out its not long before the evil ghost of the tooth fairy has her eyes on pamelas tooth  just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes acrossbr br directed by chuck bowman i thought the tooth fairy was just another poor straighttovideo low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless others which litter video shop shelves  fill late night obscure cable tv schedules basically its not very good the script by producer stephen j cannell corey strode  cookie rae brown is a complete snoozefest for the first 40 odd minutes nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all  is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone it introduces the characters sets the tooth fairy legend up  thats it the second half of the film improves slightly but even then its hardly spectacular stuff there are a few decent setpiece gore scenes but apart from that its all very predictable  forgettable stuff the characters arent great  most of them are there purely to be killed off the story has inconsistencies like the story of the tooth fairy herself it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth what happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 why has she come back as a ghost despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself  using weapons to kill people there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentimentbr br director bowman does ok its reasonably well made  there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about theres nothing i would describe as scary or atmospheric in here  dont take any notice of the comparisons between this  darkness falls 2003 as besides the teeth thing theyre quite different the gore is ok someone is shoved into a woodchipping machine theres a decapitation someone has their penis chopped off  the best scene when someone is nailed to a door  then has their stomach hacked open with an axe  their guts slide outbr br with a supposed budget of about 1500000 the tooth fairy is generally well made but theres nothing special on show here the acting isnt anything great but its not too bad  unusually i didnt find the child actors that annoying so thats something i supposebr br the tooth fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straighttovideo horror fare that seems everywhere these days if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise its pretty poor  forgettable stuff
