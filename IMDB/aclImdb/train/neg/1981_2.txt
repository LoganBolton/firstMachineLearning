sistas in da hood looking for revenge and bling bling except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw lil kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are finebr br now dont go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and whens the last time you heard john wayne call someone dawg and i dont remember the earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the ok corralbr br i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was lil kim in that action
