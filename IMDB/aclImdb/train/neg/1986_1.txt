must have to agree with the other reviewer this has got to be the worst movie let alone western i have ever seen terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s and oh did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene and the ending the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the moviecompletely awful and yes it did contain every clich√© in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable lets remember when shots when a main character dies luckily i saw this on free tv dont waste your time
