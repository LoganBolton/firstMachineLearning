i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasnt an option this movie sucks the women cannot act i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown nobody in my house could believe i hadnt changed the channel after the first 15 minutes the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous its not just a race thing its also a gender the combination of the two things is ridiculousi am sorry because some of the people in the movie arent bad actorsactresses but the movie itself was awful it was not credible as a movie it might be entertaining to a certain group of people but i am not in that group lol and using a great line from a great great moviethats all i have to say about that
