burt kennedy used to be a very good director but youd never know it by this lumbering mess not only does this film look cheap it is cheapmost of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior the last command from 1955 and that footage shot 32 years previously looks more contemporary than anything in this picture the few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized confused and incompetent looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture this has the look and feel of a bad student film and the budget didnt seem to be a whole lot more it moves like molasses the acting for the most part is either overthetop ham or underthetop comatosealthough raul julia comes off better than most of the rest of the castand its chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies on top of that its way too long if youre going to make a boring film do it in an hour or so and get it over withdont stretch it out over three hours like this one does if you want to see a good movie about the alamo check out john waynes 1960 version or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy skip it
