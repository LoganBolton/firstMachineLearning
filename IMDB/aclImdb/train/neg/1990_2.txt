this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be tolerated as a kidfilm however the tragedy of this entire endeavor is that john hurt one of the screens greatest actors diminishes himself in thisi gave it two points just because mr hurt showed upi take away 8 points because he didnt run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible janine turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all intents and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so its so bad it almost hurts
