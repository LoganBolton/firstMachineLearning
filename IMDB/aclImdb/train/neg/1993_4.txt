franco rossis 1985 sixhour italian miniseries of quo vadis is a very curious beast creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion very few long shots no big cityscapes but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the backgroundbr br the shifting structure much of episode one is played out via voice over letters and lack of narrative urgency makes the full sixhour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding and certainly far too often uninvolving but it has something going for it the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that hes become incapable of experiencing emotion and klaus maria brandauers unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his audience will receive it elsewhere max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes being rewarded with the shows most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome its the kind of thing the show could do with more of but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional inspiring or exciting moment under its relentlessly lowkey directionbr br unfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties  you know the one who you think is called dave or something like that the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly endsbr br not a trip i can particularly recommend im afraid but if you do embark on it its one not entirely without its small rewards
