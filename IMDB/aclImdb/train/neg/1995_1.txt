well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie and it wasnt even worth that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain i am guessingbr br neagle  despite her glory awards and reputation  is a homely british gal who cant sing or dance or actbr br some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic director herbert wilcox neagles husband always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance herebr br only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing
