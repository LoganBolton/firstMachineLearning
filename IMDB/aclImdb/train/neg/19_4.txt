i am a big fan of arnold vosloo finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happybr br unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didnt like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loosbr br i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but arnold is an excellent actor i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desiredbr br i love arnold vosloo and he made the film viewable otherwise i would have written it off as another lousy filmbr br i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good but the sound effects of the shootout were pretty bad there are some glitches in the film continuity but they are overlookable considering the lowcaliber of the filmbr br all in all i enjoyed the film because arnold vosloo was in itbr br jackie
