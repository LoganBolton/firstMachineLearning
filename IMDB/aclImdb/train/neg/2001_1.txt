why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of roberto moreiras up against them all contra todos at the san francisco film festival its about a hit man my friend said well   and its brazilian i added beautiful multicolored people tropical weather lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot ample enticements no doubtbr br somebody forgot to tell us one little detail this is a very bad movie really pretty horrible and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly madebr br so how on earth did contra todos get to make the rounds of berlin melbourne london manila stockholm cairo chicago numerous smaller local festivals and now san francisco apparently because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit workbr br first of all it won first prize at the rio film festival where it was called the best brazilian movie of the year it must have been a bad year theyve had much much better ones next snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and  since the movie isnt featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics  it keeps going the roundsbr br festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot a chicago festival one called contra todos a speedball cocktail shot straight out of brazil and referred to claudias s boyfriend as the stud of the slumlike neighborhood soninha is teodoros nymphlike teenaged daughter of burgeoning sexuality the movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently handheld camera and the director works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay the effect is  unbearably raw and honest and the movie hurtles toward a conclusion as deadended as the lives on display not the best writing but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewerbr br contra todos does concern a hit man two hit men actually and a wife and daughter and a bornagain christian girlfriend its shot  in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camerawork  mostly in a barrenlooking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming favelas or villagelike brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as black orpheus pixote and city of god were made and not in rio this time but são paulobr br the hit man with family problems is teodoro  giulio lopez and his partner with a drug problem is waldomiro ailtan graça both actors have a little tv experience as does the actress who plays teodoros sluttish blonde wife cláudia leona cavalli and silvia lorenço who plays his pouting readytorevolt daughter soninha these actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas who knows  in a better directed film they might even be good aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by teordoro or when hes busy gangs of thugs the principals dont work up much presence even though the camera magnifies their poresbr br a couple of observers one at the berlin festival and one at londons did see this movies failings but alas theyre buried in the web hinterlands henry sheehan noted from berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown the filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film sheehan wrote and hasnt made any creative use of the new medium  nor he adds done anything else creativebr br sheehan pointed out the movies first big mistake it starts off as a domestic drama thats supposed to ratchet up when half an hour into the action moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is at the very least a waste of time but ratcheting up is all moreira ever does like a little kid whos gotten a tool kit for his birthday and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill devastating but truebr br writing about the 2004 london festival for kameracom metin alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the films best feature yes very easily given that everything else is so bad alsanjak admitted that  this lowbudget violent and seedy account of the lawless in sao paulo is devoid of any likable characters and as a result of hope too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition the film is not helped by poor subtitling  alsanjaks connecting contra todos to dogme and mike leigh didnt help mattersbr br apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence  which when they come are just banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill  moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the banality of evil of lowlevel hit men in working class neighborhoods but he cant make the characters which he sees generically come alive for us and the structure of the film shows that he also cant edit his material br br seen at the san francisco international film festival on april 28 2005
