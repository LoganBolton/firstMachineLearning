i read the book a long time back and dont specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it since im home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey  it is a lifetime moviebr br the movie is populated with grade b actors and actressesbr br the female cast is right out of desperate housewives ive never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist is there nothing original anymore sure but not on lifetimebr br the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i supposebr br in one scene a female is struggling with a male for her life and what does she do kicks him in the testicles what else women love that but let me tell you girls something its not as easy as its always made to lookbr br it wasnt all bad i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that
