it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movieready as the house next door to be adapted for film or television the book was copyrighted in 1978 one reason could be problems designing the house the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i cant imagine anyone buying it in fact its so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was builtbr br im not crazy about horror genre books but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life and this is one of the books strengths they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demonor the devil personified without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book however it is a downbeat book for the most part and i dont think that appeals to the people who run lifetime maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come a better housebetter musica better screenplay and darker lightingwould certainly help
