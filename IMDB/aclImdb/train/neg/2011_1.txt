this movie is pure guano mom always said if you cant say anything nice but even mom would say i had to do my part to warn others of this moviebr br i can guarantee this is the film that geoffrey rush wishes would just go away i would hope that greg kinnear fired his agentfrom a cannon for giving him the script after this ben stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch theres still something about mary i have always been a fan of wes studis thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people wont identify the film with himbr br it starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the batman films and then just loses somethinglike a coherent plot and half decent effectsbr br the jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes and even then they fall flat if you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see chasing amybr br run dont walk away from mystery men
