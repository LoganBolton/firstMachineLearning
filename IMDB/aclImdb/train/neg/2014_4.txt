i remember loving this show when i was a kid i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing ive seen it was ultra hightech for its time it could repel enemy fire do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take down nearly anything in its way now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is the casts members are hardly compelling there are a lot of cheesy moments and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage lot of the footages appear to date from the vietnam war erabr br airwolf has basically the same theme as knight rider except the crimefighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car after watching a few episodes i found myself utterly bored i do however love the theme music
