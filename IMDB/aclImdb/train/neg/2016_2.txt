warning may contain spoilers my huge problem with this movie is how totally selfcentered and self consumed the adulteress wife is after having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him he calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together he is obviously crazy and very dangerous the problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to her and exposing her secret not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic as soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences maybe there wouldnt have been a movie then but there really wasnt one anyway so whats the difference
