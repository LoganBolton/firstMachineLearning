dont get me wrong this is a terrible clich√©d film but it is a delight for fans of olivia hussey  quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen one poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at  i wonder what his ideal woman looks like  paris hilslut blockbuster should really establish a subgenre to this type of film as the fatal attraction plot has become a genre unto itself when will blockbuster adopt the adultry section it will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections right this film revolves around olivia hussey who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his exwife who looks remarkably like ms hussey this neerdowell proceeds to stalk olivia and thus make her life a livinghell i like olivia hussey but i have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses so i really wasnt rooting for olivia to make it out o this stinker alivebr br violence  there is a smattering of violence in the film don murray and anthony john denison get involved in a fisticuffs when denison says that he will not stop seeing olivia murrays wife because she is just too good in bed olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round  ill let you watchbr br nudity  olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here she has a love scene with anthony john denison and also has a shower scene  shot at a distancebr br story  weve seen this plot before  a hundred times over and oftentimes done much better the true culprit when trying to decipher why this film was a dud is william riead the mans dialogue is sophomoric and moronic the man has no storytelling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot these people of the upper strata of society talk like middle school kids  with a habit of sleeping during english class i have placed riead on the nevertobeviewedagain listbr br acting  the acting wasnt phonedin as the insiders say but was hindered a great deal by rieads juvenile script olivia hussey resorts to calling anthony jonh denison weird and crazy to his face when he begins to stalk her hussey who is still beautiful delivers the best performance here but denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented lovecrazed stalker don murray was basically just there  his character not fleshed out and edward asner a terrific actor when given something with substance is illused in this film
