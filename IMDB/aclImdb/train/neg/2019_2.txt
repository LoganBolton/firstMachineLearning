oh man this sucked sucked i couldnt even get any camp value out of thisand i sat through the whole thing on showtime dont bother waiting around for the naked scenes eitherits too late and only plastic jenna jameson is involved shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits i guess showtime had to throw something in at 1am next time i think id even rather be watching espn loop around every 30 minutes
