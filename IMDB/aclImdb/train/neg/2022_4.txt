man this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books frankly i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened this movie is vastly overratedbr br shakespeare with the king james english has never appealed to me anyway so it may just be me there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othellobr br the good points of the film include  thanks to a restored print  some decent cinematography and a young slim and attractive shelly wintersbr br overall this is simply too boring too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again besides we all know that most actors are nutcases anyway but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story
