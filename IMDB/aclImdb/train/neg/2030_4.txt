the comment by eliz72121 hits the proverbial nail on the head for this turkey of a program but it is a hoot to watch william shatner cavort and dance yes the   marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv  and it does rate a few stars for one viewing or so to see shatner who seems to have taken camp to new heights  whether in a role or as himself but the guy is funnybr br the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls will be pretty much outofluck when this turkey is canceled  unless there is a revival of the whiskeyagogo genre with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once morebr br i watched the first contestant who was annoying and literally dumber than a post yet through sheer luck walked away with a quarter mil or so the second contestant somewhat more intelligent but whod be lucky to gain 1000 on jeopardy got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question  which he didnt know and thereby left with zilchbr br this plethora of game shows which dangle and sometimes award large sums to everyday individuals are admittedly a cheap effort overall to attempt to woo viewers even if the host is wellcompensated and they give away six figures in an average episode i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable  since you dont have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures per episode with some big residual deals as wellbr br but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long this one has already pretty much reached this point i think his offerings especially with james spader and the others on boston legal should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatners offeringsbr br again the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance perhaps one time that should be sufficient
