while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in and i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal well this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and downbr br it has none of the intelligence of millionaire none of the flair of deal or no dealbr br this show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the timebr br i watched it of course just to check it out i did watch it for over 45 minutes then i had to turn it offbr br the best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage he is a hoot unfortunately this show will not make itbr br thats a given
