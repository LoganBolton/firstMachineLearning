really really bad how does a film this bad get made i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point interesting camera work or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck except for the nudity and pancakes but it looks like genius compared to this dreck the best script doctor in the world couldnt have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poobr br the only thing going for this film is that it endedbr br ive got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something ugh im glad i only paid 5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill
