if i could give it a zero id change my mind and give it a 10 instead absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot doesnt make sense of what is happening just plain boring please dont waste your money on this one pleaseee this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killers story but nopes i didnt feel anything but disgust while watching it do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead its better to watch a movie youve already seen like 34 times than watch this crap i dont understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well zodiac killer should be called boriac killer instead
