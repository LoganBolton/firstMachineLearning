why would anyone want to see this if this was a film posted on youtube by a teenager i might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his mommys video camera i might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting sadly it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were apparently professional actorsmaking this a very very sad film sadand very pathetic actually as i said it has a definite made directly to video look about it it also has narration and acting that just scream unprofessionalshow could this be the film is filled with lots of corpses and blood normally this would turn me off completely as i hate ultraviolent films and dont like seeing all that gore however given that none of it is that realistic its bearable however i should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing for example the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a ladys tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad there are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women with a level of misogyny that is pretty awful the people who wrote this are pretty sicklike killing women is meant to be for our entertainmentbr br after a bunch of senseless murders the film goes to a dining room tablearound which are a bunch of goofballs wearing black hoods without eye holes they are talking with pride about all the murders they have committed and chant its all very funny though i am not sure that was the scenes purposebr br then the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even vampirism and cannibalism why i dont knowperhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap and once again you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy germanlooking man as he tracks down people and kills thembr br by the way considering the film used what i must assume are professional actors i wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly germans while they tried to act like americans and the film was supposed to be in california the accents are strong perhaps german audiences watched this and marveled at how realistic the acting was but to any american its obvious these folks aint their fellow americans considering that there really was a zodiac killer who was never captured i do wonder why anyone would want to make a fan film of sorts for the sick menace i meanwas this film meant as a snuff film for pervs i just cant see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it in fact i wonder what would motivate anyone to make such a stupid and offensive film worthless and deserving to be in imdbs bottom 100 list
