this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen im not exaggerating i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves the only thing interesting about this movie is the box on the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so i figuredeh whatever if this was made recently im sure the directing at least wont be too bad  but after i saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about its some nonsense from the early 1980s that he made great way to rope in unsuspecting viewersbr br anyway i think that they just liked the name zodiac killer and didnt bother to research any of the actual zodiacs crimes or his mo or even the years that he was active all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the stories about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiacs crimes did they also compare the zodiac to vampire of dusseldorf fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritzs son quite often the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks none of the haarman facts are correct either just a bunch of jumbled nonsense his son even says dont forget his name was fritz haarman with 2 tshis actual name just has one i think that the writerdirector simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman ooh those sound like cool names lets make a movie about them without doing any outside research great ideabr br perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsmiv and getting cured of it i was also diagnosed with dsmiv and have since recovered etc for those of you who dont know dsmiv is the psychological manual for mental disorders if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems hahabr br anyway my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list and its rare that a movie ever reaches that point but if you are interested in watching a totally nonfact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational id say check out this moviebr br oh and i liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice nice touch
