awful awful awfulbr br a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make once again im amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they dont have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crapbr br i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty goodi wonder if she has seen thisbr br watch this at your peril the boredom may kill you
