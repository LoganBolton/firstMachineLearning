i dont want to go off on a rant here butthis is the worst film ive ever seen worse than the avengers incompetent directing disjointed writing and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout shot on very cheap video it looks like a high school project but without the emotion the lighting frequently looks like a single sungun the sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera but everything else about this thing is just awful the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution the techie elements are patently absurd and the editing looks worse than a rough cut its not even bad enough to be funny its just bad btw the packaging is intentionally misleadingbr br lions gate owes me 400
