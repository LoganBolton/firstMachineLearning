i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a screambr br what a disappointment chamberlains nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into ones head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe redhaired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream timebr br spoiler in the final scene it wasnt clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay thats devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave thatd have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didnt seem so awful in this movie actually i didnt think the wave came off since the shadow left burtons face that had been cast by the wave was it only burtons apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasnt of any interest if it was only himbr br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weirs potential was in charlies apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burtons wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit
