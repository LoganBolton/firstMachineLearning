the only film ive ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and im really cheap but my brain couldnt stand any more of the dreck being piled on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gaggedbr br from the beginning to the end this film offends worse it aint funny it wasnt funny then and it sure aint funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy its juvenile really sophomoric script and ideas began an era which continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in filmbr br sexual olympics what high school kid hasnt thought of that the beginning of the end
