hearing about how hilarious this movie is i finally rent it atbr br the video store and for 75 minutes maybe i laughed 3 times thisbr br movie a collection of skits that make fun of television is anbr br incoherrent mess the jokes fall flat the humor deals withbr br issues from the 1970s that just arent relevant anymore andbr br the jokes go on way too long almost like the new snl skits thebr br past few years yeah chevy chase is in this but maybe of allbr br about 1 or 2 minutes i liked the fact that this was verybr br raunchy and had nudity galore but couldnt it be funny dobr br yourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a farbr br superior film made in the
