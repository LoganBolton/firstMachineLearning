straight to the point the groove tube is one of the most unfunny unclever and downright horrible films ever made this comedy is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that its almost incomprehensible that it was even made i said almost because there are fans of everything after allbr br this film isnt even good bad or enjoyable bad to put this movie on the same level of entertainment as plan 9 or robot monster would be a crime to those films films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of but this film is so bad so poorly made acted and scripted and so incredible stale that there just isnt even a trace of camp or schlock to be foundbr br even though this was made before saturday night live premiered comparisons were probably inevitable im not a big fan of snl but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find and man thats bad just to keep the men viewers from leaving shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often but poorlyfilmed breasts from 1974 arent going to excite anyone these days truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleepinducing excursion i doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 eitherbr br a man named ken shapiro made this film i swear to god any tenyear old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever its just downright unreal  this is truly an unbelievable film the jokes and gags are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dads porno mags out at night wont laughbr br i will give this film one thing  the very last sequence the dancing man sequence where a guy shapiro on the streets of nyc dances to a tune is easily the best thing in this horrible film not that the dancing man sequence is that great either  it definitely has its moments of not being clever as shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song  but it actually was somewhat watchable the part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film no wonder shapiro put this sequence last  again while not so great itself it easily beats anything else in this filmbr br otherwise this film is such a complete piece of crap its unfathomable as to how an actual human being can be so downright cleverless the name of this film should have been ken shapiros craparama its amazing that this was made but many truly talented filmmakers cant get in however i will say that i bet the geniuses at nyu would love this movie total garbage
