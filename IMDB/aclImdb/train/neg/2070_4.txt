after too many bad memories i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence i recently watched it again just to remind me why ive always considered this the worst sttng episode with the exception of shades of gray which barely counts as an episode at allbr br i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script redpenciled by the authors writing 101 teacher show dont tell from deanna trois pronouncement and everyone elses constant elbowing reminders about what a charming dangerous rogue okona is to guinans explanation about how funny her droid joke is it isnt to the whocares resolution to the conflict there isnt a plot point that isnt highlighted and tripleunderlined for our edification and there aint a believable moment in any of it unfortunately bill campbell a charming actor in other circumstances is too puppydog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot on the other hand it could be that no one short of john barrowman jack harkness from doctor who could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a rolebr br zero points by the way to the data subplot while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid waybr br on a good day you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode me id rather skip ahead to time squared or q who
