first off i would like to point out that the reason why i gave this movie 1 star out of 10 is because there is no option to give it no stars it really is that bad i was never eager to see this film after i saw the ads for it i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldnt be genius  the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations however about 1020 minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated i was shocked at how terrible the script was it really gave the actors nothing to work with so much so that they really looked like they didnt know what they were doing especially luke wilson the story was completely predictable  if youve seen the ad then youve pretty much seen the movie and there was nothing original about it  it pretty much borrows from every superhero story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre but alas it wasnt the direction seemed to be of realism i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well shes deadtime to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didnt make any sense i found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it and then it struck mei began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made and still pull a large audience i couldnt think of any other reason why this film would be made for movies to be made these days the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stagei cant comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage by the end and exceedingly dumbfoundingly stupid climax i was laughing heartily  just not at what the filmmakers wanted me to laugh at but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was thank god i didnt have to pay money to see itbecause that would have really annoyed me oh and could i just add that of the two wilson brothers i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better more versatile actorbut if he wants to step even further into owens shadow then this is exactly the way to do iti doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours and remember it only got a generous 110 because i couldnt select 0
