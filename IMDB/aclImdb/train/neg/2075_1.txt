i have to admit when i went to see this movie i didnt really have high expectations but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointedbr br basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends theres slight mention of a girl stalking him but thats pretty much it for that character which i dont quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the moviebr br so while on a subway rainn wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl uma thurman this is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of hotbr br rainn wilsons performance is also far from hot normally im all for his acting but even he couldnt salvage this movie his character was jumpy unrealistic and rather annoying you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate it was almost painfulbr br but anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and luke wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero or ggirl as they like to call her in the movie it still baffles me as to what the g stands for but well leave that for the message boards to debatebr br the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny but i find myself asking who has sex like that they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma thurmans passion lets say it makes my head hurt but not in the im thinking really hard to understand this waybr br when uma insults anna faris calling her a whore i had no debate with that apart from the fact that she cant choose movies properly she cant act and relies souly on the fact that shes blonde and typicalbr br overall i wouldve walked out of the theater if i hadnt paid 875 to see it the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially uma thurman someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesnt mean youre actingbr br also the script and storyline couldve used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers overall if you value your money and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie
