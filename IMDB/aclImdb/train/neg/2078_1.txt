i went to see this film yesterday and although i didnt have high hopes for this film i was still bitterly disappointed i actually cant believe i spent 96 minutes of my life watching this filmit was that bad the storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible even though it had big names such as uma thurman in it this film heavily relied on its special effectsbut they personally had no effect on me i honestly wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film it is a total waste of money and youll only end up being disappointed afterwards my advice is to save your money go shopping treat yourself just dont go and see this film youll live to regret it lol
