im a huge fan of ivan reitmani loved evolution and who didnt like ghostbusters from the trailer you already know that umas character will get dumped by lukesso the buildup is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on himbut the payoff is just not therethe shark tossing did manage to get a slight giggle but once again it was all in the trailerbr br no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is diet owen on his good daysif not for riann wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to crampthis is a comedyright br br its not awfulit just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridgethis could have been such a brilliant sendup of superhero movies and feminism but fails on both countslets see if jason reitman can salvage the family name
