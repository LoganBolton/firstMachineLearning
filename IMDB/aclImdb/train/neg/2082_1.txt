what a waste of time and money my hubby and i saw this movie  after seeing the previews and thinking it might be funny wrong this movie is about 90 minutes too long the actors are trapped in a poorly written script and cant get out the jokes are weak and tired and not even seeing wilsons naked behind can redeem any part of this film the special effectsarent i half expected to see the harness and wires holding up uma in her flying scenes and when the effects people apparently could not master the superheros fasterthanaspeedingbullet flying or fight scenes they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen  which hid the awful effects quite nicely wilsons sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office coworker the sex scenes werent sexy and the funny scenes werent funny i guess i just expected too much from these actors none of the characters were really sympathetic so i ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them the only memorable performances were the kids who played bedlam and ggirl as teenagers  at least they had some chemistry overall a super stinko movie  i wouldnt even recommend it as a rental  it would still be a waste of money
