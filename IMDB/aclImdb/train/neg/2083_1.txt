at what point exactly does a good movie go bad when does a movie go from watchable to wheres that  off switch thank goodness for dvds like this one that can be borrowed from the library  for free likewise thank goodness for the fast forward switch on the dvd player i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box officebr br at one point ive forgotten exactly when because now its all just a blur our hero luke wilson starts running through traffic i think he was looking for a cab it was at that point when i gave up realizing i couldnt care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truckbr br the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster hair dryer in hand and first meets the heroine uma thurman that scene ended with the pursesnatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far far above the departing luke and uma that was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene ten minutes into the flickbr br every time the movie tried to become funny it couldnt every time the movie approached excitement it fizzled out heading in the opposite direction when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard the sound track stayed empty and silentbr br the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish when uma turns into the crazy exgirlfriend i felt like i was watching the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction thats when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked the 40 year old virgin and pulp fictionbr br luke wilsons sidekick rainn wilson also seen in the dreary the last mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie rainn wilson the king of television boredom should stay with that equally awful medium hey rainn wilson leave fulllength motion pictures alone every time umas rival anna faris came on screen i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery once you see anna faris in scary movie thats all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick
