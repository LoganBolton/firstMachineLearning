if they gave me the option of negative numbers id use it this movie was truly godawful i went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible and it somehow managed to exceed my expectationsbr br the script was weak the acting was painful i wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth i think we were both disappointedbr br the growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain he came off as oddly weak and silly jenny johnsons uma thurman came off as psychotic and strange as did matts luke wilson friend vaughn rainn wilson
