matt saunders luke wilson thinks he has found the perfect woman in jenny johnson uma thurman who seems like a quiet but pretty woman though he soon learns that shes needy and possessive oh and shes also the superhero ggirl though you wouldnt know it from the things she does to matt after he freaks out and breaks up with herbr br a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution my super exgirlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience what went wrong the cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and i didnt like the way they played it out i was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film however they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho it just wasnt very fresh and after about forty minutes the film wore out its welcome sure there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking outbr br director ivan reitman has lost his touch after a successful run in the eighties and early nineties he started making crap like evolution and fathers day i wouldnt say my super exgirlfriend is a complete bust but i dont give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds which isnt too much don payne did an awful job with the screenplay the majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just onenote he also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at timesbr br a few of the actors were good enough to save the film uma thurman was great as ggirl and she had many funny lines luke wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting i dont think he makes for an appealing leading man and hes better in supporting roles like in the family stone anna faris was just doing her scary movie routine and its getting a little old she needs a challenge or at least some better scripts wanda sykes is either hit or miss for me she was great in monsterinlaw and she was bad in clerks 2 here she is just annoying and doesnt bring anything to the movie eddie izzard was alright nothing special rainn wilson was just annoying and not funny overall i was disappointed with the movie it wasnt awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average rating 510
