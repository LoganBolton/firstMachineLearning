i realize its not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slowpaced shows if theyre interesting but i find myself completely uninterested and bored with this seriesbr br the formula for bsg seemed to be action  adventure  scifi  suspense  mystery  dramabr br the formula for caprica seems to be bland drama  moderate scifibr br maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 i can barely watch it in fact its at the bottom of my towatch list for the week this is a sad state of affairs the syfi channel really destroyed their friday night lineup whatever happened to the glory days of sg1 stargate atlantis and bsg on friday nights they had a good thing there
