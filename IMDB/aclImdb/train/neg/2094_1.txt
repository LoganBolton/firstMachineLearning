i had to endure teenaged high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show i really do not care about highschool girls fretting about their relationships ive spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and i care nothing about fictional teenies going through lite versions of the horrors i endured i want science fiction thats the only reason im here there were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show we finally see a protocylon it was good but with one problem its red eyedot would lock onto an object of interest we all know that cylon eyedots always scan back and forth giving the machine a map of the world the red eyedot does not ever stop moving back and forthbr br i really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode
