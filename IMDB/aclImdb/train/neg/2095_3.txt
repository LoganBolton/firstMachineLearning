battlestar gallactica was so great because it had tight writing a great look excellent actors and interesting stories and yeah had hot men and women running around in and out of uniformbr br caprica was just lazy lazy writing actors smoking up a storm to give them character outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else yes that is a ford focus sitting in the background lots and lots of teenage angst lots of gyrating naked women but in the background which im sure will be cut for the series and a token view of some men in towels none of the actors except polly walker took my attention at all at an hour and a half i was still wondering when it was going to be overbr br so what exactly is it thats supposed to bring me back the science fiction its awfully light on that the actors besides polly walkers fine turn there isnt much interesting being done here there arent even any hotties in the cast except for maybe esai although for the younger set hes pretty old since hes over 25br br i loved bsg i was skeptical when i heard about caprica and unfortunately i think im right i predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils over at scifi and get to work making this more than the oc on another planet
