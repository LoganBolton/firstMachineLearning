i was hoping for some sort of indepth background information on the apollo 11 mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission linked by overhyped disasterpredicting sensationalising voiceover in the worst tradition of tv productionbr br if you could cut out the voiceover and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this couldve been great  but i feel ive wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme i want those minutes back
