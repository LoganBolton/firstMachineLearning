warning possible spoilers not that you should care also sorry for the capsbr br starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice thats all the more annoying for talking nonsense it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama thats badly but accurately putbr br we know space travel is a risky enterprise theres a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions radiation stressrelated symptoms etc and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments they knew stuff could go wrong in fact stuff had gone wrong its called learning granted appollo 11 wasnt safe by todays standards and there was immense political pressure but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressivebr br assorted mistakescomments i hadnt even to look upbr br 1 nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong well duh thats what i wouldve done it was the apex of a propaganda war after allbr br 2 nasa gives green light despite the fact that appollo 11 will probably blow up this is only implicit though yeah thats why they let people and press watch in almostrealtimebr br 3 the capsule ejection wouldnt work like it didnt work the time a chimp was in it the one that survived it was a test launch and the rocket exploded the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute theres a video of it you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewherebr br 4 one interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of florida i can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole cause if not im just aghast how he could get it so wrongbr br 5 the technology then was primitive compared to todays standards actually relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today the reason being that it must not crash its even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be built of comparably large components that arent that susceptible to radiation and the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway so a complex steering system like the b2s wouldnt do whats with the fact that they were using tv screens rather than computer screens its the same damn technology actually tv monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definitionbr br 6 if that object wasnt part of the rocket it could be only one thing we see where this is going apart from the fact that the statement is wrong who says it wasnt a rocket part at least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you dont know what it is its by definition an unidentified flying objectbr br 7 the voiceover as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the landers radiation foil was actually its hull which would make it thinner than a space suitbr br 8 neil armstrongs near death during a practice flight is footage i can appreciate i hadnt seen it before as i said any piece of manifest technology can go wrong especially if its not been tested sufficiently on account of being you know unprecedentedbr br 9the trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander due to irregularities in the moons density was at no time acutely lifethreatening neither was the fifteen seconds of fuel left which was in fact fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command modulebr br 10 a catastrophic chain of events usually results in catastrophe i really dont know how to put it any simpler this however is a prime example of the rhetoric usedbr br 11 theres a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid followed by the voiceover telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed turns out he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid hilarious stuffbr br 12 its mentioned that during reentry all contact was lost this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as its impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology again the gravity of this is implicit but very purposely sobr br 13 there was never a shuttle lost in space itself while the voiceover presents this fact as evidence that appollo 11 was a pile of crap appollo 13 was a nearloss but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and reentry respectively in any case comparing shuttles to saturn rockets is somehow  well okay just plain stupid even ignoring that the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audiencebr br 14 what the hells up with the ufo even in the context of the movie it makes no sense unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes aimed at a specific audience which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history science or rhetoricsbr br even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure catchphrases like covered up until now publically revealed here for the first time come up but the film doesnt place any blame or offer a lesson or anything which could be expected of a film so emotionally done in the good old tradition of sensationalism there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except nasa scientist wow so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor fancy that what does this have to do with the point of the movie again oh yeah which pointbr br in summary in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate its not even good entertainment and believe me im a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries this film isnt funny witty quaint its nothing
