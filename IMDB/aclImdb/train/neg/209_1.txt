i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio a skateboard chase scene jodie foster in her first grownup role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that ill never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldnt have cared less the story of california teens in the 1970s where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots dont waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie
