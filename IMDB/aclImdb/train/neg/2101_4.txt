bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist cinema was one of his biggest passions he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews tiré à part 1996 in spite of terence stamps sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters une affaire de goût 2000 was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance pas si grave 2003 was another letdown and un petit jeu sans conséquence is as underwhelming as its predecessors its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy waybr br and however the starting idea let predict a twirling spiritual comedy a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion to play with their guests they pretend to part company with each other and things dont go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesnt surprise them the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couplebr br in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal rapps undistinguished directing cant manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences the plot follows a wellworn pattern with characters who have specific wellknown functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences even the actors sincere input in the venture is debatable they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them especially sandrine kiberlain the audience is soon caught in a deep torporbr br its regrettable to say it bernard rapps films never lived up to his intentions as un petit jeu sans conséquence bears witness
