i bought this video at walmarts 1 bin i think i overpaid in the 1940s bela lugosi made a long string of 3rdrate movies for small studios in this case monogramthe ones who made most of the bowry boys films while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ed wood classics such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most diehard fansbr br i am an old movie junkie so i gave this a try besides a few of these lesser films were actually pretty goodjust not this onebr br lugosi is what else a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife hadso you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at allbr br anyways a really annoying female reporter a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen so she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi lugosis home is complete with his crazed wife a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistants sons an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the filmapparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand eventually the maniacs all diemostly due to their own hands and all is well at the conclusion the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry and naturally the reporters dumb cameraman faints when this occurs if you havent noticed theres a lot of fainting in this film or maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep
