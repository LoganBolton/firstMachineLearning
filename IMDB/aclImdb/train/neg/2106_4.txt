bela lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to dracula he is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie doesnt set the mood very well even at its worst any of belas movies is only mediocre though
