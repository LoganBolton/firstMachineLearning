maybe you shouldnt compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but theyve been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and thats nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture youre wrong its overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop i was so glad when round 86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared like krs one public enemy ultramagnetic mcs jungle brothers bizmarkie to name a few and i still dont like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesnt work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes differ and thats alright but as far as im concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i cant rate it higher than a 4 out of ten
