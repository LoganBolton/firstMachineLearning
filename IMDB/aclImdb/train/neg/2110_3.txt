now i love bela lugosidont get me wronghe is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkersthis is just another one of thosebr br lugosi plays drlorenza doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasonshe is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautifulits revealed that she is 7080 years old yet lugosi looks to be in his mid 50s so why he is married to this old woman is never really explainedbr br anyway these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be deadthen lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where its kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic statethen the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodiesmaybe the neckand then the needle is rammed into the body of lugosis wife to bring her back to youth and beautywe never really see where lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow restores his wife apparently old age makes you scream with pain because lugosis wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger statehelping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this moviea weird old hag and her two deformed sonsone son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a mean little dwarflittle person to be politically correct in todays worldat night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in lugosis dreary downstairs labwho these 3 are and how they came to be lugosis scared assistants islike a lot of stuff in this film never explainedbr br so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going toshe quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found on themso she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchidthis expert turns out to be creepy drlorenzshe quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrorsim not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty workbr br it seems that lugosis movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavensi mean a world famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed dohbr br and then later its revealed that the young ladies dont even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do this clunker reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinkerthe devil batsame silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly reporter gets bad guy dealbr br but lugosi is always goodhe is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching himthe woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actorshe had no emotion whatsoevershe just delivered her lines like a machine gun spewing them out as quickly as she couldeveryone else pretty much blew toowhen it came to being good actorsbr br but this thing is watchable if only for bela lugosi fanslugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a doghe must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded himbr br and he was rightwe horror fans will always have a love for bela lugosihe gave it his all every time he was in front of the camerawe do give two fks for youbela
