bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies im not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i dont remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife ill just guess that its spinal fluid spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s you can pretty much guess the rest from herebr br there are a couple well really more than a couple but ill only write about two of problems that i have with this movie one is the way bela is used sure he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way btw the rest of the cast is simply abysmal but to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporters bedroom to do nothing is just silly also why have him beat andor kill every henchman he has is it to make him look evil well someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesnt really need to be made to look more evilbr br the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides why brides wouldnt any female under the age of 20 do watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer in each case there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control btw an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides i guess that partially explains the need for brides
