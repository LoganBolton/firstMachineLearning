brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing no one knows why or who but an investigative reporter luana walters notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator dr lorenz bela lugosi now dr lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife elizabeth russell with the fluid of young brides to keep her youngbr br the corpse vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldnt be able to get boring unfortunately while it starts off quite well it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clich√©s and predictable plotbr br there are some good things about itbela lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly elizabeth russell is also a beautiful suave aloof and very creepy countess and im always a fan of angelo rossitto luana walters is also convincing as the reporter herebr br it maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere and the sets are decentbr br but overall it just didnt manage to hold my interest through the whole picture and for that i have to rate it poorly
