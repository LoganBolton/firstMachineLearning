if i hadnt been forced to watch this for work reasons i never would have made it past the first 10 minutes and even then i admit i fast forwarded through parts the 63 film version was vastly superior in all regards yes ive read this one is more faithful to the original play but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in 63 its overlong it drags the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative the version of kids in the 63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor in this version the kim is way too old the conrad is absolutely horrible to behold when someone ripped his shirt off him i shuttered in disgustthe director of this version has no idea what sexy is this conrad cant dance cant sing he cant even stay in tune and is simply repulsive if elvis presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began as for the other actors well i kept waiting for alexanders toupee to fall off as he danced and daly was totally over acting as momma see stapletons performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing this tv version is nothing but a total waste of anyones time
