jason alexander is a wonderful actor but its ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead the fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy in his more cutesy moments with the girl in the train station in the final number with rosie i couldnt take my eyes off him he was so repellent you keep expecting him to drop the niceguy act and start snarling vanessa williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie by the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie youll see three versions that have more revisions different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations than any other musical ive ever seen
