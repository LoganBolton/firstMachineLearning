why because for one reason there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing bye bye birdie at the opening she reprises it again at the ending too in a different mood both wonderful rent it and see even if thats all of it that you watch youll agree im surebr br everything about the original was so excellent it just didnt need a remake sorry jason and vanessa gave commendable performances as well as tyne and chynna in fact all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their all but its like trying to improve on casablanca  it just cant be done its even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it just falls short through no fault of the actors
