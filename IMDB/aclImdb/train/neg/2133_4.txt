first things first im not a conservative and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one i think its safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eyetoeye on politics in fact im sure wed become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis bbc docs are my point is this dont discredit this review by thinking im not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war inc theres no question wis politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic but the problem is the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co wrote produced and stars in fits worse than a cheap suitbr br as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions cusack his cowriters director joshua seftel and even the actors involved no doubt had every intention of making an anti war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altmans mash unfortunately for the viewer they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moores canadian baconbr br the current state of us politics foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and as a result tragic pathetic and regrettably comical  just watch the daily show and see for yourself the bottom line is you cant write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis so why try to competebr br the main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry to get it done cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank one of his best films changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton the neocons and the us occupation of iraq are imaginative clever or funny the writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive the trouble isit isnt by now these ideas are yesterdays news and unless youve been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance denial and sheer stupidity read a rightwing christian these jokes insultingly simplebr br perhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced subversive offensive and fattened up with detailed researchinsights into the occupation as it is the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad with so little finesse subtlety or satirical wickedness they did little more than make me groan homer simpson once said its funny cause its true and the daily show proves this every night war inc however proves that just because its true doesnt make it funny the bottom line hyperbole isnt required when it comes to lampooning usneoconservative politicsits already a big enough jokebr br httpeattheblindsblogspotcom
