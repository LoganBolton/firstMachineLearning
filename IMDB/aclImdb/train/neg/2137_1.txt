even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific its hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this with a string of antimilitaryantiwar movies already being destroyed at the box office its almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this scriptbr br at first it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of grosse point blank with akroyd and cusacks all over again but only about 90 seconds into the movie it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr strangelovebr br i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one i have to say that i dont know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide tom cruise was never close to being this far gone not even close
