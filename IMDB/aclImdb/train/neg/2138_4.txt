war inc  corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser john cusack to do their wetwork against rival ceos a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense theres no reason or method to the madnessbr br its considered by cusack to be the spiritual successor to grosse point blank ie war is more or less a knockoff we again see cusack as an assassin protecting spoiler the person hes supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not its all quirky often bordering on bizarre war incs not funny enough to be a parody and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the films message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesnt work because its not funny and at its heart the film has no heart were supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusacks shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by warbr br john cusack gives a decent performance his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isnt a lot of chemistry between them hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesnt make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out blech ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesnt start doling out a decent performance now and again patheticbr br its not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c
