i really wanted to like this but in the end its a poorly made film with too few laughsbr br the politics are spot on its gonna offend the hell out of republicans but thats what its designed to do that alone gives me reason to chucklebr br the problem is it looks like it was made in a real hurry like about a week and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer which seems to be completely off topicbr br turiqistan is obviously iraq or afghanistan or any other number of countries the us has fked with since the 50s the humour is a little dark amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by tamerlane corporation but it is on the mark especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction democracy lite br br however like a lot of satire criticising the us it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured i guess its running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point who knows i prefer more of a nudge wink approach  a bit of subtlety but thats just mebr br anyway i might watch it again perhaps i missed somethingbr br im hoping w is more on the mark
