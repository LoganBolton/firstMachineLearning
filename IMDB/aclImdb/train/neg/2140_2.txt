assassin hausers john cusak mission is to whack a mideastern oil minister whose name happens to be omar sharif neikov in the country of turaqistan which is run by american interests hauser poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omarbr br sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying here it does too much the government politics music war people not generally accepted by society and did i mention war and that is what we have here  a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd also there are so many cusak family members in this that john cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there or is that just mebr br it used to be that a john cusak movie while a little offbeat was in the end rather good not here believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess make of that what you willbr br there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gunfire bombings and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point probably it just takes too long to set up the hit which is largely forgotten until the last 15minutes in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast and chemistry between john cusak and marisa tormei i dont think so but you know the boy  girl thing and they needed something to take up more time br br yes for what they were supposed to be offbeat and annoying the performances of duff and kingsley were good but when i saw dan aykroyds character in the beginning of the show sitting on a toilet taking a dump i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well i was not wrong i am sure some will sing praises of this effort but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so too is a messbr br i now remember why i continued with the dvd i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself never didbr br violence yes sex no nudity no language yes
