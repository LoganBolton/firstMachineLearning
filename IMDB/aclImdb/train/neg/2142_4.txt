if you are under the age of 6 or 7 then youre going to really enjoy this movie my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it as an adult i cant stand it im all up for sequelswhen they have a decent storyline but this is nowhere near up to standard please forgive me for slating what is after all a kids film but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much youll understand why my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let herbr br ive given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained
