i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little wornbr br accordingly i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see itbr br i should have known betterbr br this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the dontsingalongs to the characterizationbr br while i remember the characters telling a story through a song this films soundtrack was laid over the top and didnt seem to fit jaqs transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall and in the ballroom theres old barn dance type country music its as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat fiddles certainly didnt fitbr br even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isnt up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of cinderellas hoop skirt which doesnt feel rightbr br the movie itself could have been its own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldnt say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original
