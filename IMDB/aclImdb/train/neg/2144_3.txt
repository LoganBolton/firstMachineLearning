ive always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie ive ever seen followed by peter pan 2 and some other sequels like the lion king 2 and the hunchback of notre dame 2 all these movies are made with the same idea because the movie has no plot they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes im not saying the jokes are bad but they make up most of the movie the first time i saw the movie i would have given it a 110 but now i think about it most kids dont care how good the original movie was they just care that the movie is entertaining i still think the movie was a bad sequel but that doesnt mean its horrible now i think it deserves a 310
