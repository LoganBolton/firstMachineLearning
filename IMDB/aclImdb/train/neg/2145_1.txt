ive got a question for those who thought of this idea why what made them think to make a second movie of this if memory serves didnt cinderella end with they all lived happily ever after im pretty sure it did or it was implied wait a minute if they all lived happily ever after how could there be a sequel unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history there couldnt be a sequel i mean sure they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours but why a movie that ends in happily ever after can not have a sequel if it does then they dont live happily ever after somethings got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending why thats not right its evil thats my final word on the matter
