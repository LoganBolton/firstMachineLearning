you will recognize the plot immediately daughters of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together again yes that was the theme of the parent trap in the 60s 80s and 90s but heres the spooky thing even though deanna durbin was younger than the 21 year old hayley mills while playing the doting daughters roles durbin looks much older as in adult and so do all of her socalled siblings br br and this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film the girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film so youre constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women when ray milland and others start hitting on them you get the feeling as if theyre pedophiles and you might be one too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out teens or temptresses little girls or little foxes you are never quite sure what youre supposed to be thinking of them asbr br the parents too seem very old and the whole film seems very datedbr br it is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you dont believe me
