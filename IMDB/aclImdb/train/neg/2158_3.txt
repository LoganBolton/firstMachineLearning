i can clearly see now why robin hood flopped quickly the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired the opening scenes were about as intense meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting robin hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughable the worst part of the episode was robin hood snogging some cow clad in makeup at the beginning of the episode  how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century nobody the series may have improved drastically since then but this first episode quickly put peoples hopes down and is essentially a pile of crp a great hero of england has been disgracedbr br will you tolerate this i wont thats for sure unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment 310
