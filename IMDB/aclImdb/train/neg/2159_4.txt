well its robin hood as geezer all right just as advertised that didnt sound very hopeful and alas it was worse than id suspectedbr br a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyers daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges notveryfunny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without reshooting the scenes again and again much sounds as if hes struggling with halfcomprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the castbr br whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role he had the knack of delivering highflown dialogue as naturally as if hed just thought it up on the spur of the moment and as this production shows thats not at all as easy as it sounds if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they havent a clue how to handle thembr br im afraid i didnt even like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a nudge and a wink at the audience theyre out of place all right  fourthwallbusting stuff  but really not that funnybr br this muchpromised production reminded me of a limping school play the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on a credible villainy and b credible characterisation  but frankly i wouldnt have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series as of the time of writing ill give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week with less stilted scenesetting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all the opening episode of doctor who wasnt exactly a showstopper though it was nowhere near as bad as this but if i see no improvement after episode 2 im afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewerbr br which would be a pity because ive got a soft spot for the robin hood legend on screen from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest
