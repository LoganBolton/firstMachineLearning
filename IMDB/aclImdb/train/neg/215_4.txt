i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and futureending up was sadbr br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 1200pm on 081006 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicatebr br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i dont feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood storybr br the two main reasons i dont like this movie are firstly the film didnt told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesnt make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didnt have a scene of alex and kiks sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing  part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
