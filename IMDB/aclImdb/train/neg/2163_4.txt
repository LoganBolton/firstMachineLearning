shame really  very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end ive seen quite a few of ira levins adaptations  rosemarys baby and the stepford wives  and liked both them but this just didnt appeal to mebr br when i read the plot outline  an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success  i was excited i like thrillers michael caines a good actor sidney lumets a good director and ira levins work is generally goodbr br i wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but all id say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the films plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first  45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loudbr br the main cast  michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth  were all brilliant in their roles though worths obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actors fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannons character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse  at the same timebr br anyone reading this  i dont want you to be putoff watching this because of my views  give it a chance you may like it you may not its all about opinion
