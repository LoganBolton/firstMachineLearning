to die for 1989 was just another dtv feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that theres no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of la looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last centurybr br this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed theyre so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lightingbr br not recommended by me because i didnt like itbr br nuff said
