having read another review i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the b movies but this couldnt even be classed as such the photography is probably the only halfway decent thing in the movie but the editing left much to be desired it was very choppy and staccato whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was awful specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately ive seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie check out blood ties youll be much more entertained
