if you rent a movie titled exterminators of the year 3000 the odds are good you know what youre getting yourself into i myself was sold by the promising descriptions of nuke mutants motorpsychos and of course the exterminators themselves which according to the back of the moviestore case are all cavorting around a postapocalyptic barren wasteland wreaking all sorts of mayhem let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensueat least such were my hopes for this filmbr br now i like the occasional terrible movie and if youre reading the comments on exterminators of the year 3000 you probably do too that being said i rated this film a solid 1awfulnot because i completely hated the film but because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at moviemaking i have ever seen the dialogue the acting the cinematography the soundediting the editing in general the plot etc etc etcall are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations given that marvelous titlebr br so what is really good about this bad movie it does have several of what my circle affectionately terms quality kills a quality kill for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase isnt a hard and fast term but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome creative or ridiculous fashionbr br exterminators of the year 3000 also has a fair supply of dialoguesobaditbecomesfunny provided in great part by crazy bull the aptly titled leader of the hapless motorpsycho gangwho incidentally also provide most of the quality kills if youre hoping for big things from the nuke mutants think again they play essentially zero part in the movieshucks crazy bull however is all you could ask for in a bmovie motorpsycho shakespearean paraphrase and oddly pgstyle insults are all he knows how to sayand thats terrificbr br despite its quality kills and bad dialogue however if youre looking for a truly entertaining bad movie exterminators of the year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects quality killing and bad dialogue there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car chases and long desert hiking sequencesall in all a pretty good awful movie but hey its no death race 2000
