its hard to believe people actually like this dreck i do think kids can enjoy it but to me its the kind of kid film parents cant bear to sit through predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the star spangled banner i had to turn the sound offthen i came here and discovered they did that because she won star search ive always felt jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful sadly missed brother and this crap shows why zero stars
