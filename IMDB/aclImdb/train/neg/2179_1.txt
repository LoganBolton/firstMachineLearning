i just loved watching it though and having fun with its total badness of a film i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater 3000 and i have the dvd if you flip the to the other side of the dvd they show the actual movie so i gave it a chance seriously folks this is grilled cheesebr br the acting special effects and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic doesnt she need lungs said crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesnt have a body and tom servo just wistfully remarks no shes got neck juice the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with kporn i loved the cat fight between the two strippers that meow after the fight or scene whatever was classic so in some ways this was a fun movie i think for horror fans youll probably enjoy it for a good time watch the mstk3 version youll get a great laughbr br mst3k version 1010 the brain that would die 110
