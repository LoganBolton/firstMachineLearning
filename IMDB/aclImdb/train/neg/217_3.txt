this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticedthat is itthe dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the sex scenes is absolutely absentthe acting and the dialog are more suited for highschool childrenyet the subject is intended for adult audiences it is a gutless and shallow movieit could have been way better if it had a story and more drama ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used makes it seem so cheapall in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view iti know the means are scarce but that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one doesand please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians tudor chirila  they cant act
