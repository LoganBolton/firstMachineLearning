 or an audience a quick recapbr br so youve got this doctor whos been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason he wants to perfect transplants but feels he needs to do this in his basement wtf and then suddenly unfortunately and conveniently his fiancé gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that hes responsible for agonized with grief he preserves her head in a lasagna pan or is it strudel and pumps it full of adrenoserum sic to keep it alive and then she awakes talking her head off so to speak even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords and she has no lungs so she couldnt speak even if she had em seems the ungrateful btch doesnt appreciate all that her fiancé has done for her just like a womanbr br then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloveds head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street meanwhile the doctors assistant a sort of dimestore igor gets into philosophical arguments with the head who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the monster in the closet every mad scientist has one eventually the screenwriter realizes that he cant keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum so he kills everybody then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movies financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it br br have i mentioned that i think this is a bad moviebr br someone should tell turner classic movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff the sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious
