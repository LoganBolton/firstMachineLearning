light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if youve read the novel then youre probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationshipsbr br true enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails miserably marias acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever her most intense moments seem almost comical sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriendbr br ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse she doesnt seem natural at all maria had the attitude even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious but she had it and her character received some credibility and to make matters worse we dont have an insight on her where does she come from how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship how did the relationship evolve we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to be there it has a content and and end but no beginning just like her partner maria she has only once scene that is truly touching the scene where she dumps marias character kikibr br tudor is the only person in this movie aside from the landlady great acting there who manages to prove some acting talent he has his characters attitude and it fits him only once or twice he seems to falter the scene at his parents meal he tries to be obvious when it wasnt necessary at allbr br i love the story tudor chirila is ok there the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style but this doesnt save the movie too bad the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography couldve used a movie on this themebr br oddly enough the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the nobackground nofeeling well marias spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction lesbian relationship of maria and ioana im quite sorry for spending money on a ticket id rather had watched it from the comfort of my room
