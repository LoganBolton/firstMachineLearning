another movie that relies upon the trite wornout clich√© of the mad scientist gone madder the movie centers around a surgeon whose lifes ambition is to bring the deadback to life i know i knowyouve never heard that one before of course as all of these movies go the experiment goes very very wrong and creates a maniacal bloodthirsty creature for this promising setup youd think that itd be at least a bit suspenseful wrong like many movies of this era the idea is nice but the execution and the script is mediocre not the worst horror movie ive seen no abominator the evilmaker 2 still takes the cakebut not one of the gems either
