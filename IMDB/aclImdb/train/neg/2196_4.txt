the brain or head that wouldnt die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s it is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of selfparody and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead ginny leith  a detached head kept alive by machines ivs and clamps  seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes shades of the underrated boxing helenabr br the genderisms are plentiful and about as irritating as an army of angry ants the dialog is hyperbolic overdramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely ok but not consistent why have i given this film a 4 because some thought clearly went into it i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts todays audiences expectbr br another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likablebr br all considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s american pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash her lover is threatening to sew a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him she is understandably nonplussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend oh there are also some vague references to the 1950s60s clich√© about the evils of science run amokbr br recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies ow not recommended
