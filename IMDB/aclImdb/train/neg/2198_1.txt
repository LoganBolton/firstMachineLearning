a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated he saves her head brings it to his house and keeps it alive  he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic or telepathetic link to a deformed monster kept in the closetbr br as you can see this is pretty stupid stuff but i had a certain fondness for it when i grew up in the late 1970s a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year no exaggeration they showed it always on saturday afternoon tvuncut seeing this on tv back then was great explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitationwho cares if it was good seeing it now i realize how lousy this really isbr br the acting is perfectly wretched the production values are nonexistent the script is pretty dumb and aside from the still pretty disgusting gore this is dull stuff theres also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film on the other its utter trash either way its not a good movie but is a mustsee for one time only for horror and gore fansbr br also the heads laugh is pretty creepy note the end credits which gets the title wrong calling it the head that wouldnt die
