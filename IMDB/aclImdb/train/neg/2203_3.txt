note to all mad scientists everywhere if youre going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i dont care if hes a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of daggersharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha get a load of this paul the monster is ripping me to shreds thats the worst part about this movie is this sharkthing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there arent other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but thats a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie
