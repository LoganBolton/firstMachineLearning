this type of plot really does have a lot of potential but it was butchered here honestly i sensed the cheese element in the beginning but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing whoa i was wrong so mad scientist makes a monster wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them but of course they escape after that its really bad i shouldve counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage but i most likely would have lost countbr br pan down to the blooddrippingfromseveredleg to show us how the sharkman finds the folks i hate being spoonfed every aspect of a horror filmbr br oh and after being nearly killed by a mutated sharkman and trudging around a jungleesqe island theres nothing more cheerful than a middleaged man reciting shakespearebr br this is one where youll find yourself rooting for the monster if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick
