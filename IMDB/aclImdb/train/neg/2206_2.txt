a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer so he thinks why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark well who wouldnt its a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark thats killing everybody is constantly being called paul also william forsythes cast as a macgyverkickasssavingtheday kinda hero lacks credibility on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death as a matter of fact i find bad bmovies quite amusing but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less then it might have been fun
