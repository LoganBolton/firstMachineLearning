hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of typecasting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a humanhammerhead shark creature bizarrely this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or somethingbr br a group of associates are invited to the scientists private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a resourceful if somewhat overweight ramboesque hero im working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someones network connection followed by a call to gun down guntoting evildoers or perhaps a call to fix someones pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with landbased humanshark hybrids anyway hes amazing and saves the day he even gets the girlbr br the sharkman is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace its complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a landbased killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter its rubbish but not as bad as some might say
