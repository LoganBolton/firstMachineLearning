if you read my review of syfys dinoshark you know that i can appreciate the lowbudget schlock that these madefortelevision movies can provide theyre stupidtheyre sillybut theyre still pretty fun in a so bad its good kind of way so still smacking with guilt for liking and recommending the undeniably hokey dinoshark i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy a syfy original movie about a halfman halfhammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island with the syfy channels surefire recipe for creating bmovie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo how could it possibly go wrong well to my surprise it actually misses the marknot by much but enough to make me not recommend it why well first of all its titular monster the dreaded hammerheadhuman hybrid takes a backseat to a bunch of fauxmilitary thugs who really become the movies primary villain though the hammerhead does rack up the body count he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after the rest of the movie is filler pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers that to me is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people br br please read the full review on my blog wwwhorrormoviejournalblogspotcom
