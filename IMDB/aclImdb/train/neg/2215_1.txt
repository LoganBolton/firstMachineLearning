this is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute sharkguy kind of like in beauty and the beast it could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks but there are some pretty gross plants instead they make this one girl really itchy so she lets herself get eaten by the sharkguy instead of scratching through the whole movie the scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to he even arranges for them to have private time for sex but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the sharkguy is an ugly icky monster and wants nothing to do with him she gave up on love just because he was a shark i thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and hed turn back to normal and theyd live happily ever after but its not that kind of movie
