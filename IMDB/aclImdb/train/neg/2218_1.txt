i do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception it may have been a brilliant horrorthriller moviebr br beginning on halloween night 1968 6 year old michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder againbr br from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing michael the murderer is exactly the same throughout the movie thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to followbr br for the horrorthriller enthusiast there is a severe lack of bloodgore compared to modern day films although i am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age a happier medium could have been foundbr br from a half hour into the movie not one scene is unexpected the acting for a horrorthriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiastbr br a positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere a second positive would be the character of michaels doctor who provides clues to the probability of where the story may leadbr br however it is clear that the star in jamielee curtis is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victimbr br it is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day but from other horrorthriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent the 90s it falls far short of a truly great horrorthriller filmbr br i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s cheers
