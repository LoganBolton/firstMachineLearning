perhaps one of the most overrated socalled horror classics ever made halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtisbr br however its rewatchability factor is very close to zero as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullnessculmination to the actual eventsbr br this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at allbr br how it spawned so many sequels i will never comprehendbr br thank god rob zombie is remaking this and generally i hate remakesbr br surely he will more than compensate for all the random timefilling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacksbr br this is a movie we feel we have to like much like the way were taught that we should enjoy dickensbr br dont assume this is a classic
