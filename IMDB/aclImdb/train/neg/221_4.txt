i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger manbr br intriguingbr br not i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other downbr br anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesnt work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small townbr br and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of mensexlust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian subplot went nowhere and those smokingdrinking women all 3 in their forties were very unrealistic  even in the baby scene  screw the baby gimme a cigarette rightbr br like i said a shame of a waste 4 out of 10
