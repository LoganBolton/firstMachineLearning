every once in a while  someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks whats with snitchd  i know immediately they have a case of barelyhidden amusement  horror you see i was the cinematographer on the filmbr br let me clarify some points regarding this interesting life experiencebr br originally snitchd was called one hard hit i met james cahill in july of 1999 a day after i wrapped triangle square a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accoladesit fell eternal victim to the fine print of sags notorious experimental feature contract but i digressbr br i though i was on a roll and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about 25000 not wanting to break pace i took it after all clerks el mariachi i too believed the myth back thenbr br lets just chalk it up as film school for many involved myself included snitchd was shot over two weeks in august 1999 in aliso viejo and santa ana ca cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city  yes he is a drama and english teacherconsider that while watching the film or even observing the use of apostrophe in title  hence the locations and castbr br of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of las channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez and of greater impact the debut of eva longoria who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt i must say her professional dedication focus and lets do this attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardomyettocome br br snitchd suffered from poor optics few lights or electricity several boom operators du jour and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication none of that overshadows the actual content which speaks for itselfbr br anyway by 2003 the film was sold to distributors  at a net loss i understand  who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box  by then she was a rising working name  but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitchd since cahills other passion is antiquarian book dealing it appears to confirm he believes you can in fact judge a book by its cover as so many have picked up this dvd based on its sleeve  one year later eva now on a soap and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted split second which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent br br 6 years later i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez mexico i though he had worked out the process my participation was contingent on casting script and crew control and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies for what it was a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez despite claims here and elsewhere the film has never appeared in any festival or venue although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject virgin of juarez and border town
