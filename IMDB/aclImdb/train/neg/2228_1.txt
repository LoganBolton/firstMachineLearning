this movie is weak the boxcover says east las toughest gang and it is really santa anas  james cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough chlo gang  it is fake  boring  senseless and whack  i tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad  it was also on the homoerotic tip far from what the videobox proclaims  james cahill should act in gay porno james is in every scene  he cannot act to save his life  the film features eva longoria who is hot but james cant even score with her  i felt at times i was watching gay porn and was turned  off by the whole film  james clearly wants to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again  his martial arts skills are minimal at best  some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one
