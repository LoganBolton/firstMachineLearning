maybe this isnt fair because i only made it about halfway through the movie one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to lamenessbr br the acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy for example  during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase  im no expert but i think people generally put it in a bagbr br they use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown its that over the top crunching sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effectsbr br worst movie ever
