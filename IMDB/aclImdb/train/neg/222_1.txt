as a single woman over 40 i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40 not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isnt much of an actress to begin with but given the nonexistent plot i hate to even refer to it as a plot in this she didnt have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel sympathyempathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then theres the obligatory malefantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try  pleasebr br not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those 112 minutes of my life back what a ripoff
