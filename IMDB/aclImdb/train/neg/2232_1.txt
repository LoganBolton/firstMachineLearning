i watched thislet me rephrasesuffered through this because im a fan of evas i dont think this is a flick shell put on the back of her head shot photos i like gangsta flix but this wasnt even close the budget couldnt have been more than a few hundred dollars and that money was probably spent on the catererbr br the premise was interesting but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or notbr br i wont bother saying who did what and how because it isnt worth the effort im only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that i didnt have to actually pay for this garbagebr br oh before you flame on me i love movies i thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know
