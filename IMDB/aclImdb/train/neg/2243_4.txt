it doesnt even merit a review other than as a warning to potential viewers its a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a wwii period drama theres no fear involved no suspense whatsoever nor any surprises one shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking the visual style is very flat and dull although there is some really nice editing once in a while the story never comes together and the films is really just a total bust 410
