there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning first of all we all know what this years oscars were really all about this year it was the academys way of showing people that they are no racistand never have been they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves secondly its kinda pointless to make remarks about the show because really what difference will it make but its fun to write about it this is the year i became fedup with the oscars i will never watch the show again every year they do something wrong before crowe wins for gladaitor when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for sunshine if you havent seen this movie yet watch it and youll agree eyes wide shut when released receieved no nominations and as far as this year goes well the bad choices were all over the place baz lurhmann gets no best director nomination are you joking a beautiful mind is up for best makeup training day gets nominated the movie was awful and it seemed like washington didnt even turn in a performance all he proved was he knows how to use four letter words thats what h won the award for take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself i liked gosford park i really did but why 7 nominations and how on earth could they not give it too altman i mean cmon if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings what about altman the man has been in the publics eye for 32 years now and no oscar there were many many things that bothered me about this years oscars but ill live with it as long as i never have to watch another show again the highpoint  and the only one of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show
