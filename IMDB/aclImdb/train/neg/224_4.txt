the worst thing about crush is not that its acted pretty bad or that the plot is virtually nonexistent and its not even that bad that the camerawork could have been betterbr br no the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to comebr br but in the end its too little too late if you are a fan of violinmusic and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40 women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage  then by all means dont miss itbr br i myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie and as a result i had a pretty horrible time the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of itbr br the verdict 410 guilty of wasting my timebr br
