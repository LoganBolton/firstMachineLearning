to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second closeup followed by another twoandhalfminute freeze frame of ms streisand  striking a christlike pose  behind the closing credits over ten uninterrupted minutes of barbras distinctive visage dead center filling the big screen with uncompromising ego that just might be some sort of cinematic recordbr br or think about this the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars yet while streisands songs are performed in their entirety  including the interminable finale  her costar kris kristofferson isnt allowed to complete even one single song he performs nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties do they actually sing a duetbr br or consider this streisands name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet  and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get codirecting credit as well one of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her thenboyfriend and former hairdresser jon peters as such streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction what it doesnt explain is how come given every opportunity to make the great diva look good their efforts only make streisand look bad even though this was one of streisands greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performancebr br anyway moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sexdrugsandrocknroll streisand plays esther hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with kristoffersons john norman howard a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to hasbeenville in the previous incarnations of the story norman maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer vicky lester achieve her success in the feminist seventies streisand  co want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the trajectory is skewed shell succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one hes a burden she must endure in the name of love as such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher but almost ruthless while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twitbr br kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his aimless listless character well streisand on the other hand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen everything she does seems if not too rehearsed at least too controlled even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical the two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence though at age 34 streisand doesnt seem particularly young or naive the only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom and indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make streisands character openly play an exploitive villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to existbr br but i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim they dont seem to be aware just how coldblooded and self absorbed she is but sensitivity is not one of the films strong points note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio the oreos and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the characters name of the previous films from esther blodgett so that streisand wont be burdened with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive so much for ethnic pridebr br the backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the films release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable nominal director frank pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert surtees and the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the oscarwinning evergreen by paul williams and streisand but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didnt want it to be a vanity project
