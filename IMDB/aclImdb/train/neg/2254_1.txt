ok people honestly this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz thats ever been made but ive been laughing myself silly which may be why i enjoyed it basically its all about sex sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie if you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment watch this movie when you get the chance and dont have something better to do br br attention spoilers the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat  on the show and flashing his wallet with his loves pictures a triple a for bad taste and fun
