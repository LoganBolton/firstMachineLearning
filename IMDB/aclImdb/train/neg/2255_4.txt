was this movie stupid yup did this movie depth nope character development nope plot twists nope this was simply a movie about a highlyfictionalized springer show it shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on tv molly hagan did a great job as jaime presslys mom jaime iswellgorgeous this flick wasnt so much made to be a breakthrough movie rather it was intended to life in a trailer park i live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie where everyone sleeps with everyone else all the girls get pregnant by different guys and all the guys drive rustedout 66 ford pickups exaggeration of course but thats the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park some people overanalyze movies caseinpoint star trek freaks i watch movies purely for the entertainment value not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene read the goofs bit about connies shirt could it have been better sure but it was funny as hell
