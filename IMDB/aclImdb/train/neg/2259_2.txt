for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show its so incrediably trashy some ways sadly its a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that weve seen at least one episode its part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently its pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie pressley is in it shes playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it wouldve been perfect then so i would recommend skipping ringmaster just watch the jerry springer show its more enjoyable than thisbr br 210
