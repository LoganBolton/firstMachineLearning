i cant quite say that jerry springerringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film ive ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe im not supposed to care about them maybe im supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isnt the humor is not outrageous its innocuous its predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springers show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clays obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bedsty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on 12000 a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesnt even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
