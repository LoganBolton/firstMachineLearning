ok let me say that i didnt expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold all i asked for was it to be cinematicand it wasnt even that it looked like someones bad home movies poorly acted scripted and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people ive ever seenbr br the films plot focuses on a lowclass family who decide to go on the jerry farrelly show to discuss multiple affairs between a mother daughter stepfather and the daughters fiancee from there the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience whitetrash pornography theres redneck sex interacial sex even sex between jerry and his wife yuk this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision at least it was mercifully short disgusting and degrading africanamericans and working class america should be offended howard stern should be pleased however he didnt squander his attempt for film stardom his was smart funny and entertainingbr br my grade f the daughter was hot
