ringmaster jerry springers pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film first of all it was made second of all people went to see it third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen if a monkey could make a movie im 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good most crappy movies have their moments even godzilla had a few cool special effects this films moment was when i left the theater nauseated the only thing that possibly couldve made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half ill take a dump in a can if anyone didnt utterly despise this movie i pity you and your children and your childrens childrens children however contrary to springers beliefs i clearly dont condone children having sex
