lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show well if that idea doesnt intrigue you which it shouldnt stay away from ringmaster i had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie i guess jerry springer doesnt play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show and he is only known as jerry in the film the plot if you can call it that is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mothers live in boyfriend so the mothers brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughters boyfriend is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin man with her friend in bed together so of course call americas therapist jerry springer id talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache jamie pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie and remember michael dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk the thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it getting in touch with his charecter but if your idea of fun is seeing jerry springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestiteswelljust watch the show instead  at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick
