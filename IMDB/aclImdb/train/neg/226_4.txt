andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet fallingout with 2 longtime best girldfriendsbr br seeing a gigologolddigger in the sincere young man the girlfriends deadset on terminating this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend who obviously is blinded by this gigolos tricky gamebr br a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous far fetched no longer covers it without these unbelievable scenes there may have been hope for a sweet love story instead all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head  these things just dont happen without giving away cliffhanger details i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film most like me will be very disappointed on a scale of 1 to 10 this one ranks a weak 4 with me there is much better material out there this one isnt worth your time
