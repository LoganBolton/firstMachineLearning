the only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the tv show this is also the main reason that fans of the tv show wont like the movie but not the only reason this movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal it approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making and then gets even worse i wont waste your time describing this movie in further detail suffice it to say that i pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this cp the first time
