im not a regular viewer of springers but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally im going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry springer uncensored first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the films running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudofarce about trailertrash jealousy incest and deception jaime pressley who looks hot as hellll is a trailertrash slut who sleeps with her stepfather a very unusuallooking chainsmoking drunken michael dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show thats right no springer and then we have a parallel story with an africanamerican couple they take it to the jerry show the characters collide blah blah freakin blah trash has rarely been this borrringg i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie well now its totally obvious whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie how can i explain its a total mess of a motion picture if thats what you call it its so badly edited with scenes that just dont connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and its simply all over the map just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs br br my only positive note is a hot girlgirl scene thats as risque as it gets dont get me wrong the scenes pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on springers programthis disastrous farce seems extremely sanitizedbr br my score 3 out of 10
