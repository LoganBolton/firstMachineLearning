this wasnt the major disaster that i was expecting but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie im not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but i suppose its all a matter of taste personally i dont find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again im not a fan of jerry springers pathetic daytime talk show i didnt get too bored watching this but i was definitely never enjoying it either if youre in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isnt too painful to sit through this is a good choice
