the vampire bat is set in the small german village of klineschloss where gustave schoen lionel belmore the burgermeister is holding a meeting with inspector karl brettschneider melvyn douglas from the local constabulary about all the recent murders six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood  bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks brettschneider doesnt have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a vampire brettschneider isnt convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large bat meanwhile the latest victim martha mueller rita carlyle has been found brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant vampire bat is responsible  if it is hows he going to stop itbr br directed by frank r strayer the vampire bat was a cheapie from majestic pictures to cash in on the success of its two stars atwill  wray  their success in the previous years doctor x 1932  is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative  enticing title may have lead you to believe  quite frankly its rather dull the script by edward t lowe jr takes itself rather seriously  sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers  that something could possibly be a vampire then for most of its duration the film focuses on brettschneider  his incompetent investigations which are not to put too fine a point on it boring the vampire bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesnt quite know what it wants to be the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly scifi there is no vampire bat the attempts to fool you are pathetic all the characters are broad stereotypes  you can tell the villain of the piece straight away  as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat i know its old but thats not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933  a bland flat dull boring  misleading film such as the vampire bat just doesnt cut it these days just look at the original king kong 1933 released the same year  how brilliantly that still holds up today i didnt like it  i doubt many modern filmgoers would either its as simple  straight forward as thatbr br director strayer doesnt do anything special but this is a case in point where i can cut the film some slack because of its age as a whole its pretty much point shoot  hope for the best stuff there isnt much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from the old dark house 1932  universals european set on their backlot are nice  add a certain ambiance to thingsbr br technically the vampire bat cant compare to anything even remotely modern for the age of it its alright i suppose but again i draw your attention back to the original king kong speaking of king kong its star fay wray has a role in this as does horror icon lionel atwill ill be kind  say the acting is okbr br the vampire bat will i imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that its a horror film about vampire bats when in fact it isnt personally i thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore its short  it tells its story reasonably enough but i must admit im not a fan
