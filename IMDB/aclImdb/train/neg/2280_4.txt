its the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier dracula 1931 and frankenstein 1931  in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson caves its a poverty row feature its not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior filmsbr br from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesnt happen thats the disappointmentbr br we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of maude eburne aunt gussie and the premise for lionel atwill dr von niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil robert frazier never made very clearbr br do not watch the technicolor dr x 1932  which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter  before watching this the way i did its an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first structurally the vampire bat still isnt that good it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainybr br besides dr x and mystery of the wax museum both 1932 and co starring fay wray lionel atwills most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in son of frankenstein 1939 and as moriarity in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in dracula 1931 as the young lovers melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene but thats about it he can be seen in the old dark house 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in the most dangerous game 1930 then theres her 1933 classic screamer too bad more time money and rewrites werent available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4
