now i wont deny that when i purchased this off ebay i had high expectations this was an incredible outofprint work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy however i was soon to be disappointed apologies to those who enjoyed it but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch i got a few smiles sure but the majority of the funny came from the music videos which ive got on dvd and the rest was basically filler you could tell that this was not als greatest video achievement that honor goes to uhf honestly i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd so if youre an ultrahardcore al fan and just have to own everything buy the tape off ebay just dont pay too much for it
