well thats 90 minutes of my life i wont get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic dont even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isnt enough irony in the world to accept that one the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting id be injecting the horse toobr br if you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs
