who is bettie page i certainly didnt find out while watching this movie from what i have gathered from other sources ms page was highly in demand in the postworld war ii period as the queen of naughty pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts i never did get to know bettie the woman though her childhood in tennessee was a combination of an evangelical christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at the film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film the naughty pictures characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of bettie in her pointy bras bettie in her girdle and stockings bettie in bondageetc the movie slides from black and white to color every time ms page visits miami beach then back to her shades of gray life in new york we go gretchen mol portrays bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet when bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her high school valedictorian by getting an a rather than an a one can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class the most interesting part of this movie is how quaint ms pages naughty photos seem in 2007 it is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit wouldnt even get a hit on my space or you tube im not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds i would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments
