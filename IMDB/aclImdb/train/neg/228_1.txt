i thought it was a newyork located movie wrong its a little british countryside settingbr br i thought it was a comedy wrong its a drama well up to the last third because after the story becomes totally abracadabrantesque the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate it means close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feelingbr br what do i have left maybe a good duo of actress yes i know they are 3 friends but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me the tall doctoress surprises by her punch and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual all in delicate soft and almost mute attitude this gentleness puzzles me because as other fine artists or directors the same pattern is repeating over and over in her case its like whatever the movie its always the same character defined by her feelings her values who lives infinite different stories i still dont know how to set the limit or the fusion between the artists and the worksbr br another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch  the interesting different points of view the women have each their own way of living even if they are all single it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as peoplebr br finally the movie is quite viewable but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision
