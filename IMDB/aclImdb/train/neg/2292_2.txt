first of all i must admit batman the animated series is the best batman series by far we watched it when it used to be on tv i didnt realize that there was a season four actually there wasnt btas ends with season 3 and it should have stopped therebr br why did they have to mess with a good thing catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces the joker looks beyond scary it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier he doesnt seem to have pupils anymore and now he doesnt even look remotely human although he isbr br bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman although he now looks like superman there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same bruce wayne now has blue eyesbr br night wing really needs a haircut please alfred just has pupils from eyes looks more like a character from the 80sbr br i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic there is blood in every episodebr br if you are a fan of batman the animated series there is no batman season 4 they just included this series as season 4 for marketability if they just released it as the new batman adventures i dont think as many people would have bought itbr br save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 13
