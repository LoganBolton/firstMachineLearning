if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman  the animated series i for one think it failed terribly the character drawing is lousy catwoman for instance looks awful but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just cant take care of himself in a battle without the help of two even three sidekicks i mean hes batman for gods sake i know the comic books i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batmans allies besides robin but still making batman say that he needs help from them what he cant handle a few punches in btas he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem hes getting old come onbr br and another thing i really dont think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon without years of hard training one its irresponsible and batman is everything but irresponsible and two its not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to thembr br batman  the animated series made history with its animation its stories and its characters that really was a legend of batman the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick
