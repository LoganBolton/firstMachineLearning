i turn on 700 club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made im one of many believers that is considered liberal by most christians and conservative by most nonchristians i vote my mind and its usually not rep or dem  i dont believe 700 club tells people what to believe but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club it bums me out to hear name calling either direction i think 700 club folks really do love jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that theyve forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like jesus did please dont judge jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on him and lets also not be as ignorant with our comments about them why are people so mean to each other
