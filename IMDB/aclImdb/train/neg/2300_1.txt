the 700 club has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself to make matters worse its been on the air since 1966 implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies headed by pat robertson the unscrupulous megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition the 700 club takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding broadcasting news as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the worlds problems are to blame on homosexuals wiccans new age spiritualists muslims jews hindus nonfundamentalist christians democrats single mothers foreigners feminists evolutionists environmentalists nasa scientists and anyone else who doesnt share their fanatical religious views its actually the best fake news since the daily show or the weekend update segment of saturday night live or since fox news for that matter of course pats always the one who makes each of the decisions saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts in the meantime he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another  no less than a measly 100 to become a member by the way  to fund pats african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment no never mind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth its all for the greater glory of god dont you know and of course the hosts of the 700 club are always willing to read letters written by viewers as they like to put it coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by viewers supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts they claim to have words of knowledge come to them but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them honestly how can anyone take a show seriously when theyre using a poor applause recording it should make people wonder why theres no studio audiencebr br the sad thing that pats cronies and viewers dont realize or just dont want to realize are the horrible things hes done and said this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism ironic considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements his rants against homosexuals single mothers and any number of sexual practices he considers sinful are interesting considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war as the bible says be fruitful and multiply so congratulations pat  thanks to you theres probably a number of children born to single korean mothers then of course there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez not that hes a saint but still oh yes and lets not soon forget the time this crusader for human life supported forced abortions in china very christian of him wouldnt you saybr br and just in case pat has forgotten i havent forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany honestly to compare his plight to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable speaking of which need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals of course history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history if he was pinocchio his nose would encircle the earthbr br unfortunately more and more people continue to believe him every day this is your wakeup call people the 700 club is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history its evil masquerading as good its a wolfinsheepsclothing its bigoted filth that tries to look clean pretty and loving its living proof that hateful dangerous religious views arent confined to certain groups in the middle east even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught and if jesus was to appear to this club he wouldnt be emulating them instead hed be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president if he did hed be the harbinger of armageddon  and not on the side of the good guys
