i find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that i didnt this movie has a very hard time following andor staying to a plot if someone tells you its a comedy dont be fooled its about 98 percent odddrama and 2 comedy all actors turn in a great performance that cannot be denied however it seems like it really lost something somewhere dont know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what this had potential and instead it was really a flop i would really like the hour and a half i invested in this movie back but the video rental place doesnt do returns on time save your money and see something else
