i was true to my regard for mr glover and ms goldberg i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about after much discussion we all agreed that this was not one of their better effortsbr br it doesnt hang together very well it is too choppy and there is little comedy i am disappointed it could have been much betterbr br i waited months to see this film based on the liner notesbr br dont waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr glovers and ms goldbergs filmsbr br it was a poor way to spend an evening
