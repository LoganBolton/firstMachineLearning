lot of silly plot holes in the film first we see him watching his master practice kungfu and die in the midst of his practice thats fine with me and then at the end of the film we see him use the kungfu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid is that even possible i dont think sobr br this show is purely for jay chou fans and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development cinematography styles and unfolding of plotbr br anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the idolized player li xiao look so similar to each other to the extent that youd think they were the one and same person long hair sunshineboy look tall and strong the two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at allbr br the jokes were lame and not funny at allbr br the scene with regards to the 4 masters of jay chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala royal rumble style worse of all when the 4 masters won the fight the crowd began cheering and the match continued it was truly a wtf momentbr br at the end of the show when they win the match all thanks to jay chous excellent kung fu skills how he acquired those kungfu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his masterbr br and then his longlost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge jay chou as his longlost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the filmbr br in short this is a jay chouflick instead of the usual chick flick watch it only if jay chou is your fan if you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of imdbs top 250 films of all time then this film is not for you
