this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90s by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies the most famous disasters in their ouvre are subspecies seedpeople and trancers none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid actually hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs i learned that it can have several disadvantages if youre a fan of him for every good movie it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones anyways the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers one good one whos here since 150 years to protect the humans  jeffrey as drmordrid  and one wicked one called kabal he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot combs gets his instructions from mentor that guy only exists of a pair of eyes in space very very cheesy that is  every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but thats about the only form of special effects this movie has got the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other its over before you know iti would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little but nooooooo in some scenes you really can detect some originality and creativity  like for example jeffreys lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals  and if you really pay attention you might even find some very small but nice aspects  like the raven which is called edgar allen but overall its a terrible waste of time and energy im a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyesbut he sure doesnt have to put on a stupid maillot for that
