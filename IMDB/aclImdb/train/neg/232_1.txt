this had to be one of the worst films ever when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clappingso hollywood another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement andies acting is so bad in this film  i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed andie anyway this was such a campy movie i usually like these type of films but i just couldnt get into this film too many unlikely situations and again andies acting didnt help the film also she is all gums lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals
