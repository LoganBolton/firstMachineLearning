i liked how this started out featuring some decent specialeffects especially for a film 50 years old there was some pretty impressive scenery however the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis altaira morbiusbr br viewing this in the 90s after a long absence it was fun to see francis again an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was releasedand is still acting it also was interesting to see a younglooking leslie nielsen dr john j adams who i wouldnt have recognized had it not been for this voice br br i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep i appreciated them redoing this vhs tape in stereo but it was a weak effort this is one those overrated film where elites think is so heavy and thoughtprovoking thats nonsense it only appeared intelligent because the rest of the 50s scifi films were so stupidbr br some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen which i didnt have at the time of this writing perhaps another look  this time on the 2351 widescreen transfer would make me change this review
