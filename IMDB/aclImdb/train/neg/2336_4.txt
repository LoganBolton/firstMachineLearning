i read some gushing reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look disappointed on the plus side the male leads are good and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince seems to be full of its own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing messbr br it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as followsbr br a film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism fatalism menace and cynical charactersbr br well that is the story here 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness alcoholism laziness indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each otherbr br would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actressbr br whilst some good moments i finished up feeling i had wasted my timebr br 410
