i dunno what the hype around this is this is really a bad movieit did nothing to me the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party and a nice song is playing uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you movethat was the best part of the movie otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in theres no story theres nothing to think about like some people say theres no cohesion between the different storiesit was more of an attempt to redo andersons magnolia which was brilliant but it fails blatantly okay its light and easy to watch but that are movieclips too maybe first write a story before you make a movie 410 one of the worst belgian movies ive seen
