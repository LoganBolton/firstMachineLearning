what we have here is a classic case of too much patriotism this is what happens when you live in a small country with very little next to none even cinema history whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries borders this is especially the case when the writerdirector of this particular film is already a nations sweetheart because hes also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band any way the wind blows is by no means a bad film but its definitely overrated if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer this is basically the flemish version of classic movies such as short cuts and magnolia and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end the only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of antwerp where they all live and work but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party the main problem with any way the wind blows at least according to yours truly lies with the characters they really are random uninteresting and honestly dont experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary it was presumably writerdirector tom barmans intention to depict the average  regular inhabitant of antwerp but then seriously what is the point one of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis two siblings recently lost their father and the most mysterious one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes there are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen but theyre even less worth mentioning these people simply drivel on and on about very random topics like life in the 80s dates and each others bowel motions and philosophy about matters nobody cares about some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles especially the interactions between the two twentysomething guys from ghent but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable the film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of antwerp and as an extended  versatile music documentary there are several stylish  nifty sightseeing images of antwerp and theres always beautiful music playing whether really loud or subtly in the background generally speaking any way the wind blows is a competently made and stylish effort but too mundane and slightly boring and i honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it werent a flemish production
