ashley judd in an early role and i think her first starring role shows her reallife rebellious nature in this slowmoving feminist soap opera wow is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or whatbr br being a staunch feminist in real life she must have cherished this script no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie its right up his political alley toobr br unlike the reviewers here i am glad judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained not preached the heavyhanded liberal agenda
