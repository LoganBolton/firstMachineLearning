there was a great film to be made about steve biko sadly this wasnt it denzel washington  never the most flexible of actors  is totally unable to convey the great charisma that biko had attenboroughs big crowd scenes are laughable the soweto massacre wasnt like this three neat lines of children  some doing cartwheels marching happily into the guns of the soldiers with biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce if the struggle against apartheid was anything it was a black peoples struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family im sure donald woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that biko was important while he wasnt penelope wiltons accent is pure hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in south africa at all at all the woods family dog gets more lines than the black maid as the family make their escape one the women i saw the film with  incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large full cinema  whispered this is like the sound of music she had a pointbr br overall this is a film by a wellintentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black peoples struggle and really south africa needs wellintentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head
