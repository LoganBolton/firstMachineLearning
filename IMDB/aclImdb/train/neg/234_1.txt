this film was choppy incoherent and contrived it was also an extremely meanspirited portrayal of women i rented it because it was listed as a comedy thats a stretch and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it she wasnt im a gal i watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it wasbr br warning plot summary below rampant spoilersbr br the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her but shes so happy with her oversexed puppy that youre rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy but her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishywashy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her it works she has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck remember the movies title so now hes dead twothirds of the way through the film and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnantbr br shes already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister she had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh but now she tells him shell marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they notquiteconfess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed she has the kid in the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug i kid you not its that bad i left out the part about the cancer redherring and the harpys ridiculous lesbian moment
