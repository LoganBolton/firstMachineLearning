i have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show the acting was hamfisted and amateur the story was old news and plot development or lack thereof invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode thats about all there is to say of it because it genuinely lacked substance of any kindbr br how can you people like crap like this its freaking stupid its an insult to your intelligence i dont even know how to further explain it its as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look or because for whatever crazy reason you havent seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times beforebr br i just forget it this show sucked and thankfully its gone forever i wish theyd get to work on demolishing the oc once and for all
