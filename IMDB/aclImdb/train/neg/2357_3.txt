lets hope this is the final nightmare this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad okay there is still some enjoyment to be had but only in the most mundane sense rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise had been on the production staff and produced even i dont know what she was thinking but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance bybr br tom and roseanne arnold i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrotedirected this disappointing piece of garbage she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an overglorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror with the contrived use of a 3d ending arent those glasses nifty and you get to keep them its the equivalent of you just spent 900 making me rich heres 10 cents now dont you feel special sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special br br and freddys had yet another facelift this one was for the worst i think all the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper less detailed set of prosthetics he looks  less like the burn victim he is supposed to be and more like he has a skin disorder changing the leads makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor but wait theyve done that and done that so i guess it doesnt matter but it mattered to me freddy is no longer scary hes just  another lowrent monster like the leprechaun br br its morea dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty oneliners and clever repartee sadly it fell short on both accounts br br so theres nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film br br it rates a 3210 frombr br the fiend
