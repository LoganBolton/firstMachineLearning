this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that freddys dead is it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time it was boring pointless and nearly death free the horrible 3d ending and overthetop corny kills are enough to drive this film into the ground however it doesnt stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and youve got yourself this heaping pile of guano its no wonder why freddy as always played by robert englund has made two postmortem appearances i would too if i went out like that this is a strictly fans only movie dont stare at our shame
