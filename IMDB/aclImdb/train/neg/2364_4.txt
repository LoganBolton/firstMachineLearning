freddys dead did the smartest thing it couldve done after the disappointment of the fifth film it started from scratch sure this final film in the saga is silly but at least its original some of the visuals are even a bit breathtaking and the story of freddys kid lisa zane returning to town to face her evil father is uniquebr br overall the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater it has a bunch of good actors zane yaphet kotto and lezlie deane who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter its onesided its a magictrick and in the end its nothing but goofy childish entertainmentbr br
