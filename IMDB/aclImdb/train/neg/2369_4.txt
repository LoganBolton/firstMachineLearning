sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood now he wants to broaden his horizons and spoiler needs a family member in order to do itbr br a failure as a horror movie because it simply aint scary at all works better as a dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer too many wisecracks thats for sure the actors arent interesting save robert englund as always and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto and there are simply far too many visual effects the finale is ok but doesnt provide as many sparks as i think one might hopebr br in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killers story it provides englund the opportunity to do more nonmakeup scenes than ever beforebr br there are cameos worth noting a joint cameo by thencouple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shockrocker alice cooper and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had becomebr br film debut of breckin meyer who plays spencerbr br one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing creditsbr br 410
