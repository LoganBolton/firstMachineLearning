i very nearly walked out but id paid my money and my nearlyasdisgusted friend wanted to hold out after the endearing wideeyed innocence of a new hope and the thrilling sophistication of the empire strikes back i remember awaiting return of the jedi with almost aching anticipation but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage i was bitterly disappointed and enraged at lucas he should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesnt have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart episode i would go on to reinforce this fact  your honor i call jarjar binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury firstbr br from the initial raising of the gate at jabbas lair this film was nothing more than a twoplushour commercial for as many licensable profitmaking action figures as lucas could cram into it  the piglike guards the hokey fleshpigtailed flunky that vile muppetpet of jabbas the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens fifteen seconds each onscreen or less and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection the blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseatingbr br lucas didnt even bother to come up with a new plot  he just exhumed the death star from a new hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment what an appalling slap in the face to his fans i cant shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans ive got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that i could dream up and theyll flock to the theaters to scarf it up plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in and i get a cut from every single one itll make me even more obscenely richbr br there may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable ripoff i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sellout to profit
