freddys dead the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger robert englund leaves a teenager shon greenblatt on the outskirts of springwood with no memory of himself who he is or why he is there the local police pick him up  take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie burroughs lisa zane interviews him she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in springwood where they discover that no children live there  therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone it all turns out that its an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter  use her to escape springwood when maggie realises what freddy is up to her  some kids decide they have to kill freddy once  for allbr br directed by rachel talalay this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five of course as any horror film fan knows if theres still money to be made from a franchise or a character then theres no way in hell freddys dead the final nightmare was going to be the last one which of course it wasnt the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here  freddys dead the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them the film moves at a reasonable pace  its rarely boring but its so silly childish  feels like some sort of liveaction cartoon with some awful setpiece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes cravens suspenseful  effective early 80s original the sequence where stoner spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on its own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall  floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing ive seen in a while or maybe the early scenes when the john doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the coyote cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard you cant take this seriously  i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon yeah thats right a pair of cardboard 3d glasses the characters are poor the dialogue is poor  the plot is confusing it doesnt really stick to the elm street continuity  overall the film is a bit of a mess the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour  you can certainly laugh at itbr br the film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark scary  sinister yet its so silly  simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat theres not much gore in this one theres some cut off fingers some stabbings someone falls on a bed of nails  thats about it the body count is extremely low here with only three deaths the final twenty or so minutes of freddys dead the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i cant comment on how well this does or doesnt work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3d which take advantage of the process the special effects vary some are quite good actually while others are terrible  freddys burnt makeup this time looks quite poorbr br this apparently had a budget of about 5000000 it had an opening weekend boxoffice take of 12000000  the film has a few nice visual touches  gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold  roseanne johnny depp  rocker alice cooperbr br freddys dead the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series  apart from some unintentional laugh value theres not much here to recommend or enjoy fans of the series will probably like it  defend it but for me this is about as far from wes cravens original classic shocker as it gets followed by new nightmare 1994 which tried to take freddy krueger  the series in a new  different direction
