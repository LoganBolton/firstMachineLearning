unimaginably stupid redundant and humiliating closure to the nightmare on elm streetseries part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes cravens initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke this isnt just the worst entry in the elm street saga its also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre the story is dumb the character drawings are ridiculous the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom  jerry cartoon the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video gamecharacter and pogosticked him around the walls of a house the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middleaged daughter youd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures but no theres only one teenagesurvivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure the john doeboy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults how about that freddy krueger who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3dglasses sort of like ruins the whole essence doesnt it as far as im concerned nightmare on elm street has always been a dreadfully overrated series but up until now even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements freddys dead however is simply unendurable and nobody should waste hisher precious time watching it
