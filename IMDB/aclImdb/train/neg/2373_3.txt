warning review contains mild spoilersbr br a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st series however just two years on and i find i cant remember enough about them in order to do it  i guess they couldnt have made much of an impression from what i do recall some of the sequels  dream warriors in particular  werent as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams doesnt lend itself to narrative tension but while i cannot recall much of the first five films i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddys deadbr br an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the characters demise the fact that the movies conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the films being goes to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture wasbr br taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain robert englunds innowayscary interpretation booms with laughter i always thought freddys mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe its like englunds crying out we know this is garbage  but youre paying to see it so whos the one laughing and im sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight was freddys appearance in the films always so rudimentary all he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars and thats it if this was the only elm st film youd ever seen you wouldnt get to know the character at all even as the character predeath in a flashback englund plays him as a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic ie overstated misplaced and not at all funny ironybr br acting is almost universally poor just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language only kananga himself yaphet kotto keeps his dignity and when roseanne tom arnold and alice cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire the script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit carlos ricky dean logan opens a road map upon which the noel cowardlike freddy has wittily written youre fked when prompted for the map carlos responds well the map says were fked who wrote the screenplay oscar wildebr br or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are magnified oddly the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect nice hearing from you carlos quips freddy hoping some better lines will come along its also worth noting that dream sleep doesnt occur instaneously so being knocked unconscious wouldnt allow instant access into freddys world though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3d finale plot logic isnt that high on the list of requirementsbr br the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series tracy lezlie deane is the only one who gets to greet freddy with shut the fk up man and a kick in the scallops and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients freddys dead no laughs no scares no interest no funbr br
