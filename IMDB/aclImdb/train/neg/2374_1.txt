actually they dont but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is there were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities and dont get me started on the badbr br the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but i will recap them here in case anyone cares anyone who hasnt seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point the first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with freddys longlost child now the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is hereditary so why not a mysterytype slasher in which lisa zanes character dreams of freddy murdering the teens only we later discover its actually her doing all the killing sound like a good plot idea to you obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de lucabr br then theres the trip to springfield where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis funnily enough said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond ones comprehension and control the essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror showbr br of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless theyre the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in that in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with freddys dead it just doesnt try at all leave alone hard enoughbr br on a related note i feel kind of sorry for robert englund now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character he has played far better characters in far better productions the sciencefiction miniseries v for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played freddy is selling him rather short it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now as for the rest of the cast well i think their performances here speak for themselves they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than bgrade horror props even yaphet kotto doesnt escape this one unscathed as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of bfilmsbr br all in all freddys dead gets a 1 out of me id vote lower but the imdb doesnt allow for that fd is really a testament to how a writers inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise
