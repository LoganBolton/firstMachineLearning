freddys dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that im just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge its almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and theyre just destroying it instead of reinventing the story this was a sequel that wasnt needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger representsbr br freddy is back but hes got something we dont know about a daughter maggie shes not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but its hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isnt it but freddy isnt giving up without manipulating her into his waysbr br freddys dead the final nightmare is also presented in 3d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels its tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series id rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didnt like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows bestbr br 210
