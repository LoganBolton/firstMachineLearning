george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune he interviews her on her yacht they fall for each other in bathing costumesbr br it turns out quite early that she is not an heiress she part of an advertising campaign for the cold creambr br the movie follows the ups and downs of their romancebr br the supporting cast does little to buoy it up davis and brent carry the picture though its fairly predictable it is also fairly entertaining its far from her best but especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre its not one of her worst either
