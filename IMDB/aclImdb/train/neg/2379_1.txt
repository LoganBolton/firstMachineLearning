ill admit i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin the avengers and this onebr br this has to rank as the worst movie ive ever seen yes it ranks even lower than the avengers everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief br br even if you think uma is a goddess like i do please please dont subject yourself to this movie youll hate yourself the following morning for it
