a cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland the romance is very unrealistic fluttery lovey dovey perfect etc the cinderella plot till the very end and shahid kapoor is the only reason for my stars if youre looking for a dreamy romance with a twist this is definitely youre movie but for the rest of us real world people id highly recommend saving your three hour watch time wake up peoplebr br four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film we had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes maybe im missing something i just cant believe a movie like this can beat a classic like hddcs
