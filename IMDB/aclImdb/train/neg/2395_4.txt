could this be by the same director as dont look now or bad timing poorlybr br acted clunkily edited you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in dont look now to see how much roeg has lost hisbr br touchbr br even the generally reliable teresa russell looking a bit chunky these days im afraid to report cannot save this one the plot is pure pseudoreligious hokum the acting is wooden and roegs attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitifulbr br avoid this one like the plague
