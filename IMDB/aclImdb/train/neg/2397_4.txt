nicolas roeg  he directed the classic supernatural thriller dont look now didnt he  strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonights screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever  br br you see its impossible not to compare cold heaven with dont look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child  in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak  this doesnt occur but about one third of the way through the running time theres a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist its not explained in any great depth  in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie br br people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and its impossible not to notice them  if i didnt no different i would have thought this was a tvm since its got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence  roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesnt help the movie at all  one cant help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen br br cheap production values  disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
