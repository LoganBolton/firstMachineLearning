being a fan of movies like fire sale wheres poppa airplane i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned well wrong conclusionbr br not only is this not funny it makes you angry because it isnt bad in a schlocky likable way but in a really bad way its badbad the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when youre trying to entertain your audience with humourbr br adam arkins speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie still this cruelty of nature doesnt prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story  if you can find onebr br ed mcmahon  i had to think of jay leno another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor well ive seen a few leno movies and hes laurence olivier compared to mcmahonbr br kenneth mars is good though in the few lines that hes given im not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasijokes every 5 minutes or sobr br the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over  he literally does starting 75 minutes into the movie hes in every scene but its too little too latebr br when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason youre supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that havent prepared for an exam in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an f but please dont assume im a teacher that is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molesterbr br if you actually look for a likable schlocky horrorscifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try man with the screaming brain by bruce campbell or watch sunshinecore if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock those are equally funny albeit involuntarily
