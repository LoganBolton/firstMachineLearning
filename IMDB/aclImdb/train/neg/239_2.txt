i wont say this movie was bad but it wasnt good either i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this this was completely old fashioned at every stage of this movie i hoped for some twist and what do i get the girl gets burned and wins her aunts love br br despite of being engaged they have to take permission for every little move they make they are so darn shy even after so many meetings i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that all she did was crib madly br br hey we have kids too but we dont watch them and have tears in our eyes always this movie is a dream happy family one cruel woman good inlaws and a man who loves her to death in hahk anupam kher was the poor brides father and now its vice versa and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie anyway i believe i wasted my time i give it a 210
