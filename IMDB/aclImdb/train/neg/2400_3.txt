no this wasnt one of the ten worst films of the 1980s but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere this movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 how else would you explain special effects predating an american werewolf in london disco still being considered cool and ronald reagan not being the 40th president of the united states while were at it lets not overlook those 1970s hairstyles in the 1950s and 60s ive seen more of that here than in happy days  laverne  shirley combinedbr br the one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad its good category was the late great elizabeth hartman but just barely biff plays as miss montgomery the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot a stereotype thats been done to death and is still being churned out by hollywood today but even as a hot chick she retains her mousey qualities her call for help is evidence of this she also looks much better as miss wimp seven bucks at the beauty parlor shot to hell she wasnt kiddingbr br this isnt to say that there arent any good parts elsewhere theyre just few and far between and im not just saying that because i like hartman incidentally teen wolf was better than this teen wolf too was better than this and that wasnt even so goodbr br
