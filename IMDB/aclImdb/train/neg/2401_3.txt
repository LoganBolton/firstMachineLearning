ive seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake more comedy than horror full moon high puts the c in cheesefest the star quality in this movie is not bad just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill adam arkin plays tony an allamerican high school football player of the 50s who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in transylvania the most annoying part of the movie was the violin player he drove everyone batty ed mcmahon plays his ultraconservative father who met his end of his own bullet adams father alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game after all these years tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then hell get the chance to catch in his state more laugh than blood shed this movie is just a start in the 80s teen wolf was an improvement from this 1 out of 5 stars
