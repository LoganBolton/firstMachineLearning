it was a painful experience the whole story is actually there so i wont go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work i thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesnt even tell him anything about itnot to mentioned bad acting very bad cant get any worst than that my advice dont watch and i thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently uwi bolls movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this
