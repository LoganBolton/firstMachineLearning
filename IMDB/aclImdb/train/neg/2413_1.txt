may contain spoilers a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before review the same movie again dont get me wrong i still dont like the movie i still think its dreck and i still think the zombies dont look all that zombieish the story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame the story is about a guy named rick who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells in animals and his brother germaine the two arent exactly on the best of terms my my an original plot point and argue a lot one day germaine is shot in a driveby shooting and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate germainewhereas most people wouldve called 911 but whatever naturally the serum fails and germaine dies if that didnt happen thered have been no movie after the police and the coroner until the end of time i will still think that maybe the paramedics shouldve shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which i still believe was just someones van with a coroner decal thrown on the side and germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics i would talk more about the plot but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you wouldnt want to watch it and we wouldnt want that now would we but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended as ive previously said in my review the zombies dont look all that much like zombies i still think they look like theyve been in a bar fight thats not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims also i still dont like the fact that the directors continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move they couldnt really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do dont get me wrong im all for running zombies but make up your minds people in one scene the zombie runs toward the living and in the other he just shambles to them and sometimes they just dont seem believable yes i know their fictitious creatures but still i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room and i still dont like the zombie who is lying on the ground gets shot then jerks like he was just shot the sound in the movie also bothered me mainly the music which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much nonexistent music in a movie is important folks especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick the acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the american actors from the japanese zombie movie junk the movie is still bad almost house of the dead bad its better no doubt about that but then again thats not saying much its not the worst movie out there and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasnt good i also think the movie moves really really slow despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes i still dont like the opening song this is the type of movie i think is wellsuited to be premiered on the scifi network which is why i am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten but think of it this way at least its not a negative one
