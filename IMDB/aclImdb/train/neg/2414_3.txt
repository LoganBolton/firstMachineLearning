i happened to spot this flick on the shelf under new releases and found the idea of a hiphop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up thats how it was billed on the box anyhow and i thought to myself what a great idea plus theres a welcome to oakland sign on the cover too how could i resist unfortunately the hiphop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme neither hiphop music nor hiphop culture had much of a role in the movie having lived in oakland myself i know that there are many aspiring hiphop artists there so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick why the quiroz brothers didnt take advantage of this is beyond mebr br once the film got rolling it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and latino you might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie but it didnt somehow the quiroz brothers vision of urban culture boils down to driveby shootings and dropping an fbomb in every line in the movie the rapidfire use of the word fuck is probably this movies most distinguishing characteristics there were single lines that contained the word three or four times and no line didnt contain it at least once im not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers also the quiroz brothers and the script was generally very poorbr br the film was generally a disappointment it would have been interesting to see a genuinely urban culture zombie flick but hood of the living dead doesnt deliver on that count the characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else there was no distinct flavor to the movie its just another runofthemill low budget flick with bad acting lousy writing amateurish direction bland cinematography a cheap soundtrack and nothing at all to recommend it
