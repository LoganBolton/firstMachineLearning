you know the rest if you want a good zombie movie dont rent this movie if you want a documentaryesquire look at hood life youre at the wrong place as well if youre looking for a laughable piece of film this is a real winner the acting is as flat as a piece of paper the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the driveby i can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice if i could hear a cardboard box talk itd probably sound like this guy oh yea and the zombies did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall note sarcasmhow did this not win an oscar for best makeup the quirozdid not do any sort of directing i felt like i was watching an improvisational period piece the period is more like 1990s la the direction is however oneuped by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie i havent heard such lovely lines like the epic one word beginning to the movie fk since ice grill which was another urban thriller this only works of course in conjunction with the alsoepic hiphop soundtrack all 3 or so songs of it all in all what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled hood of the living dead i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene and boy it delivered and more i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror yea right movie for the night a memorable experience for sure
