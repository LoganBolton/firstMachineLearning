2 stars and im being generous minor spoilers look this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland oakland as the plot goes a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drivebybr br the main problem with this movie what zombies all the zombies do is growl which doesnt sound even remotely scary and drip fake red blood from their mouths no scary eyes no decaying flesh just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiotsbr br the cover is also misleading there are only about 6 zombies in the whole film so its not like the whole hood is plagued with zombies or anything its just a few and is contained in no timebr br the acting actually is so bad its hilarious no one can act at all in this movie except maybe one of the gang members and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together decided to cast their family and made a movie one weekendbr br final note since when do doctors wear tracksuits skip this one please
