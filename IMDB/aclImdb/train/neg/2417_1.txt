this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on i feel dirty for admitting that i rented this movie and actually paid money to see it this does not even rate trash no no this is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer to call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man this luvahire character claims this movie is great one has to question his grasp on reality lets take some of his comments and analyze thembr br the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good jobbr br i see well if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers then yes ricky did an outstanding jobbr br im an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and its not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it offbr br wow i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes luvahire you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off still they can help you if you need to practice crying just watch the movie ha ha ha br br bring on the sequelbr br if i was your theater teacher at school id fail you based solely on this comment alonebr br i am too disgusted to continue i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate mr bangla br br howdy if youve continued to read this far i take it for granted that youve already seen the movie and youre now looking for one of two things in this comment 1 additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie 2 additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee if i say anything good itll only disappoint youso let me assure you there is little chance of such disappointment br br the other negative comments here at imdb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie eg the acting the soundtrack the directing the dialogue the editing etc however all of these faults can readily be forgiven in and of themselves few people will rent a movie titled hood of the living dead if they require these elements to be topnotch the ultimate failure of hood however is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name hood of the living dead practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny oneliners and gruesomely creative kills here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto to have gangstathug zombies bombin on the innocent living while rockin dorags to have undead pimps drivin over alltoomortal police in their trickedout rides the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious instead the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing but dont understand to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their videorental audience i suggest that the quiroz brothers rerelease the movie with the following new title hood of the living dead a homemade horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored or perhaps they could release it as a documentary the day creativity died an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio br br the potential renter whose interest has not been quelled should find the following blurb on the back of the video case the quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interestingmr bangla
