in director sooraj barjatyas vivah20something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure smalltown girl his father has selected for him to marry drawn to her innocence and simplicity shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after hes met her at her home in madhupur and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor the marriage is fixed for six months later and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young budding love their geographical distance notwithstanding but amrita whos been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents death is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage and then its up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionallymuch in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain barjatyas new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise but sadly the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated even more farfetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps and the problem is clear  you just cant relate to such squeakyclean characters who dont have one bad bone in their bodies there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films and timing is one such important factor twentyfive years ago perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp perhaps the films only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish you can make out right away that the filmmakers intention is not to deceive judging both by barjatyas previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world he believes in his goodasgold characters he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumpsbut alas hes unable to translate his vision to the screen its difficult to overlook how onedimensional his protagonists are  shahid and amrita both virtuous and virginal  i mean think about it the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film barjatya may think hes returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah those pairs had mischief and masti shahid and amrita are just insipid and boringfor a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story the filmmaker chooses a string of 70sstyle tunes that only further slacken the films deadening pace but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesnt work for me its because im not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatyas story to some perhaps vivah will give hope that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere but im a little cynical i guess so give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya ill even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain but save me from these dullards you know some marriages arent made in heaven this ones vivah
