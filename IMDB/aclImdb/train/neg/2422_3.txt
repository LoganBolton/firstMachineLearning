this movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldnt be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldnt be seeing not the best abc family film if you ask me if there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better hollywood isnt doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations theres really no reason for them at least this is a tv movie i wouldnt want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it if you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them
