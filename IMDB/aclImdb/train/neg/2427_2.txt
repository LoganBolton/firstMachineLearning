dont get me wrong i love action and revenge flicks ive seen many of them since i was a kid including dolph lundgrens latest the mechanik which is quite good and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing filmsbr br but with man on fire and even more then with domino scott shows that rather than using his filmmaking genius skills intelligently he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesnt offer him man of fire is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour lessbr br the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you the audience to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into itbr br at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings violence and making pg13 movies i find also suspicious that a 70 million movie is made of a bmovie script with a character who cuts fingers puts a bomb in a mans ass and blows a guys hand with a shotgun all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isnt even dead go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence thus said
