scary yes scary jampacked with nudity from fat people to skinny people maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in sabr br i first saw this film two years ago  its safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy  just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the newage characters staring down between a girls legsbr br girl youre not going to find god in there guy nah but i think i found heavenbr br steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing ones genitals together avoid
