from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer bad acting even peter falk cant find his way finding john christmas is better left lost ms bertinellis performance is without depth or emotion as are her costars william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah jennifer pisana as soccoro the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing but who can blame them with material like this michael j murrays script is juvenile at best br br each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen films like miracle on 34th street ernst lubitschs delightful the shop around the corner and of course the 1951 version of scrooge theres frank capras classics its a wonderful life and meet john doe hey forget the classics what about home alone or  home for the holidays with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr br br my present to you is by way of advice your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding finding john christmas merry christmas
