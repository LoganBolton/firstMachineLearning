not much to say on this one a plot you can pretty much peg in the first 10 minutes nothing overly wrong with this film very little action for an action film there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally whether an action film is the right genre to do that with im still undecided sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to as it had little twists and a straightforward plot i was probably guilty of that so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be betterbr br 410 but the best of my 4 out of 10s
