i will warn you here i chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasnt an action film in the usual sense rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alrightbr br i am here to tell you that they were wrong completely wrongbr br well no not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick they were right about that but it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as wellbr br tom beringer wasnt too bad i suppose no worse than usual but what possessed them to cast billy zane in this was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers a way to made their film a guaranteed flop in that case it workedbr br if they were actually aiming for success then why not cast somebody who can act oh and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write ah yes and a director who knows how to directbr br as someone who sat through this mess actually believing it would shortly redeem itself i can assure you it never did pity it couldve been a good film
