well ill start by admitting im not a john ford fan i watched the informer only because im trying to work my way through a list of the greats so if you are just move along cause youre not going to agree with mebr br what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution but as usual ford is determined to bury it under overacting and cheap sentiment i suppose its somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the lessthanseamless transition that was being made from the silents to the talkies  the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue of course title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times what dialogue there is usually has a theyre always after me lucky charms quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent of course as bad as they are the accents are helpful in reminding us were in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over it feels as if with an eagle eye you might see some villagers off to torch dr frankenstein in the backgroundbr br techniques change tastes change so i wont go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day but its not one of the classics that hold up  more just fair warning about the kind of oversimplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career
