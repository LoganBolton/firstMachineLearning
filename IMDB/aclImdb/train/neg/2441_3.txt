i thought intensive care was quite bad and very unintentionally funny but at least not as bad as i thought it might be sometimes its somewhat suspenseful but never a good shockerbr br spoiler aheadbr br the fun lies in ridiculous moments but the alltime classic moment is this peter koen wauters is stabbed and beaten by the killer he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway amy nada van nie kneels beside him and asks poor peter shall i get you a bandaidbr br this movie was shot in dutch and english to spare costs all license plates are usa and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan very funny if youre dutch and watching the original version in dutch
