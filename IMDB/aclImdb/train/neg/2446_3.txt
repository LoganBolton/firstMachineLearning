rajkumar santoshi without any doubt has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of indian cinemabr br this movie falls short of all expectations as this movie stars two great actors mr amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you have to make a magnum opusbr br in the later part of the movie you can make out that amitabh bachchans voice has been dubbed by some other person which was due to his illnessbr br still the movie didnt had proper character development plus cinematography wasnt good too and one thing that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with a high budgetthe script had so many flaws which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls rather than watching the moviebr br the new comer shakes the leg well but could not act well but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematographybr br a talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singhbr br but every director once in a while in his career makes a bad filmbr br so watch it only if you are a fan of multistarrer flop movies
