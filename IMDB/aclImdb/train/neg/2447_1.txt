after watching khakee i felt ill get to watch another good film but sadly the film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce aryeman afterall his father keshu is the producerbr br rks spoke so highly about the film during promotions saying the film has meat unlike films released that time i wonder which films was he talking aboutbr br the film is actually a typical masala film with loads of comedy romance action everything jumbledbr br the ease at which the kids kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts ever imagine kids kidnapping dawoods familybr br the end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterizationbr br rks gives his weakest film till date except some bachchan scenes the film is a borebr br music is boringbr br amitabh tries to give the role his all he does his part well though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar his dubbing too isnt matched properly at timesbr br akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hamsbr br aryeman seems expressionless tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenesbr br bhumika emerges the best of the lotbr br the rest are okay
