the premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting but this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director ravi tandon in his film jawab1985 too the problem here is ace director rajkumar santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced actionthriller viz khakee or an emotionsrich heavy duty drama viz damini and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome if we ignore two of hispukar 2000 and lajja2001 this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value therefore this film comes as a surprise as to what made this script Â–sensitive director going for halfbaked characterization of both of his protagonistsamitabh bachchan and aryeman as the film is getting over audience didnt know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of selfrealization and regret by the don about what went wrong with his own family the revelation of dons son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in khakee worked so effectively with aishwaryas character that is not all there is more to it the whole dramatization of life of an underworld don operating from abroad looks quite illogical his openly landing up at mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable pitching a mediocre newcomer actor like aryeman opposite mr bachchan is again not a good idea but nonetheless film has some plus points ashok mehtas fine camerawork two good fight sequences coordinator abbas ali moughal some light wellacted scenes of akshay kumar in the ist half santoshis fastpaced slick treatment and of course mr bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character but all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your family
