watching this again recently i found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure by any objective measure this was a disaster but i found it easy to imagination how good a lord of the rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely  and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers unfortunately thanks to jackson that will not be possible for a long timebr br watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all then this story simply couldnt be stuffed up fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film there were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that peter jackson did it although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution the way they tried to show the wraith world from frodos point of view for example or the way that galadriel showed sam what was happening back home for anotherbr br another thing i really appreciated in this version  the silent moments there were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still backdrop compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the jackson films and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched jacksons films were full of their own importance this was quieter and a lot more modestbr br jackson and co hit this with more than us270 million dollars in production costs at least 90 million dollars more for marketing a massive tax break from the nz government and also gained massive savings from filming in nz not the usa however despite the marketing claims the intention to be faithful was never there this is well documented philippa boyens said as much in an interview when she said they deliberately didnt reread the books before writing the script jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film along the lines of the lord of the rings and that the one he really wanted to do was return of the king because it had a lot of battles but no character developmentbr br in contrast this film tried to be more true of course a lot of things were wrong the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything and the pace was too fast naturally they cut a lot and adapted other scenes and for this they deserve credit while jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway theres actually a curious similarity between the structure of the jackson and bakshi films near the beginning  in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way  although of course some of this could be coincidencebr br this was not a good film but the potential was there bakshi said in an interview to the onion av club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice his version didnt work but he might have been right
