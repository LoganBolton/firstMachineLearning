i saw this movie during a tolkienthemed interim class during my sophomore year of college i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy everyone else was laughing but they werent within constant eyesightbr br lets get it out of the way the peter jackson lord of the rings films do owe something to the bakshi film in jacksons version of the fellowship of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshis film shot by shot you could call this plagiarism or homage depending on your agenda br br im sure the similarities dont stop there im not going to do any research to find out what they are because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film im sure others have outlined the similarities look aroundbr br this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor and many many people died in the accident ive decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion if ive left out anything else that offended me its because im completely overwhelmed confronted with a wealth of failure and at high points mediocritybr br due to heavy use of rotoscoping gandalf is no longer a gentle wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the filmbr br saruman the white is sometimes referred to as aruman during the film without explanation he wears purple and red for some mysterious reasonbr br sam is flat out hideous the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying yes hobbits are small like children but they are not childrenbr br merry and pippin are never introducedthey simply appear during a scene change with a onesentence explanation the film is filled with sloppy editing like thisbr br frodo sam pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his backwhich was not visible beforeand begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into lalalas awfulbr br aragorn apparently is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic no pants complete with huge square pilgrim belt buckle he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movieoftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his assbr br the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace this is disturbing to be sure but not frighteningbr br the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen in which they stare at frodo who is on the other side on horseback goes on forever during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and do nothing else the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodos hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound it turns out to be more plodding than anything elsebr br gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf hes a dwarf there is simply no excuse for that he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome its a crude but accurate descriptionbr br boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudds golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode he looks ridiculousbr br despite the similarity to tolkiens illustration the balrog is howl inducing and the leastthreatening villain in the entire film it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers and its barely taller than gandalf purists may prefer this balrog but ill take jacksons version any daybr br the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments im not asking for actionpacked scenes like those in jacksons film but they are supposed to be fightingbr br treebeard makes a very short appearance and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all watch the film youll see what i meanbr br alright now for the good parts of the filmbr br some of the voice acting is pretty good it isnt that aragorn sounds bad he just looks kind of like the jolly green giantbr br galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal like tom bombadil she seems immune to the rings powers of temptation and her voice actress isnt horrible eitherbr br boromirs death isnt as heart wrenching as in jacksons portrayal of the same scene but its still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book though i dont believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he didbr br as my professor pointed out between whispered threats the orcs mainly at helms deep if im correct resemble the warravaged corpses of soldiers a political statement that works pretty well if you realize whats being attemptedbr br while this isnt really a positive point about the film bakshi cant be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie or so ive been toldthe project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higherups who im sure hadnt read the booksbr br let me be clear i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product br br overall i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkiens classic trilogy even for laughs unless youve already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters places and events im sure somebody somewhere will pick a copy of this up in confusion if you do keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it
