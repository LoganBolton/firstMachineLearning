obviously i didnt care for things to come aka the shape of things to come as much as most viewers that means that there is a good chance that youll enjoy it more than i did at any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of viewbr br directed by william cameron menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by hg wells of his own novel by the same name in my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriterbr br the film opens in 1940 in a londonlike everytown war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them it does and it turns into a decadeslong affair that basically destroys civilization wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath we see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting we meet a postapocalyptic community ruled over by a wouldbe warlord we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society we see the way that technology is changing and finally were taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moonbr br that might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together by the third segment i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments theres a constant parade of new faces we dont get to learn anything about any of thembr br it doesnt help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited they are also occasionally manipulativeit can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film but maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionallybr br in fact one overlong section is more like a music videoindustrial promotional video if features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on at one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score i cant say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of dramabr br but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is a film about ideas that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way one it still doesnt make it work as a film that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented herebr br the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations thats a fine thing to make a film about its also remarkably prescient of world war ii as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936 wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film for example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesnt preclude progressin fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectlybr br that would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film it deals with a complex dilemma one pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field they cant both breathe the gas without harm a girl comes along they only have two functioning gasmasks between them the pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says hes dying anyway what to do its not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideasthe bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a warare enough to build a film onbr br another example during the scenes featuring the wouldbe warlord in the postapocalyptic environment there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around it turns victims into something like drunken zombies the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought its a great idea and deserved its own filmbr br similarly wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas that was enough for its own film too its just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when its supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attractionbr br still there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing if youre at all a scifi buff this is a historically important film given menzies background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated its also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of george méliès 1902 a trip to the moon aka le voyage dans la lune just dont expect too much from things to come
