beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes and to be honest thats all you need to see combine to create something that is hilariously sidesplittingbr br the opening scene in space is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets as washingup liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue before youve had time to work out whether its you whos gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to lifebr br and aside from the doubleheaded plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time pure geniusbr br the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that ive only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely perhaps i own the only copy in existencebr br
