i really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance its basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably it consistently feels like it was written and acted by highschool kids for some school project and thats also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines arent funny in the first place an attempt at deadpan delivery would have helped  certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected tobr br id recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big mommas house or norbit people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time
