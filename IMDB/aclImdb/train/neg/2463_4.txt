i dont know how to describe this movie its definitely one of the weirdest movies ive seen in a long time it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone whos into gore  splatter i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettlingbr br the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone but if youre a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking forbr br if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment give it a trybr br my rating 410 maybe a little too weird for my taste
