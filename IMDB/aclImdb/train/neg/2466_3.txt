theres been a vogue for the past few years for oftenasnot ironic zombierelated films as well as other media incarnations of the flesh eating resurrected dead fido is a film thats either an attempt to cash in on that simply a manifestation of it or both  and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies the joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped squeakyclean alternatehistory we are in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves version of a 1950s suburb br br its a moderately funny concept on its own and enough perhaps for a fiveminute comedy sketch but it cant hold up a featurefilm on its own the joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again and loses all effectiveness the soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders the word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh br br the very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here cant help but irritate me it is so stylized in it evidently pleasantvilleinspired way that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950sness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 there is something obnoxiously sneering about it as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open downtoearth and superior the 2000s are br br because the characters are such broad representations of popculture 1950s types its difficult to develop much emotional investment in them each has a few character traits thrown at him or her  helen is obsessed with appearances and bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father  but they remain quite twodimensional performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine the best is billy connolly as fido the zombie who in the tradition of boris karloff in frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak br br there are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around  to commodity fetishism racism classism war paranoia et cetera but none of it really works on a comprehensive level and the filmmakers dont really stick with anything br br unfortunately this film doesnt really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of look zombies in leave it to beaver for a good hour andahalf
