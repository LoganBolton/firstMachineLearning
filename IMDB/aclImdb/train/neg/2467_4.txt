this movie gets both a 610 rating from me as well as a 910 here is why as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration this movie will bore you its basically a family drama similar to what youd see on the lifetime channel but put in a horror universe the story and formula are ageold retreaded hundreds of times if youre looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts youll be disappointed take away the zombies and youll have something just as melodramatic as a beautiful mind tripping on cheese this is the 610br br however the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and overthetop its literally something you and your friends would joke about when youre halfdrunk    but that joke actually got a theatrical release the idea gets a 910 from me the only reason it isnt perfect is because they could have taken it even further but they didntbr br the mix of both is mixed i thought it was funny but as with most all comedies it wasnt that funny i had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted there were moments of utter genius but there were also moments of pure boredombr br i sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of overthetop risk and original ideas i just cant say it was perfect or even near it because of the lack of originality to the plotbr br a great family movie a great movie to watch with a bunch of guys or girls a great movie to watch with anyone    but if you watch it alone it will be a bit boring other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richerbr br 410
