i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesnt forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel youll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasnt there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anythingbr br is it the redneck is it the wendigo no its a cameraman on speed thats not scary it doesnt generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless youre scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audiencebr br terrible film
