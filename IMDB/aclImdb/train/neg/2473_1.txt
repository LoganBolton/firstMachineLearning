if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one incredible bad the main characters the mom the dad and son are ok specially the mother shes a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point triller and good script the script hasnt any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it otherwise just stay at home and sleep oh actually there was something funny the movies from 2001 but we couldnt realize it since the image is so bad like on minidv and the cars are so old like 70 and 80s
