i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin schwartzs scary stories books according to that story the wendigo  after calling your name in the wind  drags you along and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion schwartzs story turned it into a fairly coherent ideabr br the movie wendigo doesnt it basically consists of every horror flick clich√© family moves to new house and strange things start happening anyone who harms them is asking for it and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy ive seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to countbr br anyway avoid it patricia clarkson and erik per sullivan dewey on malcolm in the middle have done far better than this
