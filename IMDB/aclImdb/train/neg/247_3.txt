it was 930 pm last night at my friends camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park airs at 1030 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride ill start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought holy sht i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that its a complete ripoff of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions insteadbr br the second thing is i wonder why it got its tv14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween specials and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 well ive got news for him shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four timesbr br all in all i dont mind father of the pride i dont hate it but i dont like either ive seen way better from the simpsonsbr br 3510
