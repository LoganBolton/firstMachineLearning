spoilers galore this is an absolutely awful film first of all it has that guy from medium i guess hes made a career out of playing super doting dads it was ok the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monsterbut then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again and so it goes this film moves in excruciating real time at one point i started imaging it was days later until i was reminded that the story line was only at the next dayin the early afternoon still im not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life first of all they are presented as sort of a manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid but they drive an old blue volvo those types stopped driving volvos decades ago today they drive priuses but in 2002 im sure they still werent driving volvosbr br ok then theres wendigo a mysterious indian man gives the boy a little magic wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic cmonare we still doing ancient indian mysteries just to drive it home they pan across every indian statue in their tourist trap upstate new york town american indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film oh and about wendigo he is not actually the cause of the horror he doesnt kill the kids dad which is the most horrible thing in the filmhes just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle the wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dadoh but wait it seemed earlier that wendigo was kind of mad at the dad maybe because he killed a deerso then wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killedbutbr br and so it goesinsulting boring and nonsensical there is no reason to watch this film at all
