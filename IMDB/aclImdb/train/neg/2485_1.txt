there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be we often see films which we describe as pretty awful or not much good but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films arent good they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation ie to give me a present it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasnt this is so utterly clich√©d so badly written so poorly directed so badly acted that im surprised everyone involved hasnt been arrested and sent down for 10 years god its awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes  sometimes  bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isnt one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin
