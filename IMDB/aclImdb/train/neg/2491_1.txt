maiden voyage is just that id like to say straight away that i watched 5mins of this before i just couldnt stand it anymore as already stated in another comment this film doesnt fall into the whole so bad its good thing its just bad the acting is awful the sfx are poor and the story is bland and stupid even the extras suck the bag guy guards and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistolsbr br dont even bother watching this film the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are you will still be disappointed
