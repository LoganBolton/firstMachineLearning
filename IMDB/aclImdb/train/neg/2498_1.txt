forgive me for stating the obvious but some films are good and some films are bad of course there are extremes within those two broad categories films such as the godfather saving private ryan and star wars slot comfortably into the good category at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply dont deserve to be mentioned by name occasionally however someone produces a truly woeful film a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be a film that is more than bad such a film is maiden voyagebr br briefly maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil scheming ships owner of course there is an all american hero on board complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest who saves the daybr br this is a production that plumbs new depths everything about it is bad the acting the direction and the socalled plot are breathtakingly poor in short it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomingsbr br yes its that badbr br i will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film however its dumberthandumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i meanbr br imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard what would you do i dont know about you but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea not this guy he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results enough said such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production teams lives
