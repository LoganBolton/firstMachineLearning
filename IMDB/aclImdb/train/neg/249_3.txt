saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was dont get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldnt stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleepbr br the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who dont think christmas is nothing but humbug after 30 minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after allbr br i can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so wellrated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny
