i saw this on tv the other nightÂ… or rather i flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when i couldnt stand watching it any longer it was bad really really bad not so bad its good just flat out bad how did it get funded who thought this was a good idea an actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasnt good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of  i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american ascents the shooting was dullllllllllll the action was awkward and stilted the dialog was inane by far the saddest thing was ship in real life the interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesnt scrub up well instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls i kid you not they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness dumb dumb dumb dont watch this movie not even as a joke
