yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply and badly made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s are there still lurking out there for the record not that you will care really this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard under siege and speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictabilitybr br the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying sonbr br the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand the acting is as wooden as the deck the script woeful the one liners predictable the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat throughbr br there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time is there any chance of something at least half decently made semi believable and most important original no i thought not
