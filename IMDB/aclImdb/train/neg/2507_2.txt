this is not a good movie its disjointed all the acting is bad and has a lame story youve seen a thousand times done much better else where not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away worst of all no one bothered to tell lonette mckee she cant sing but who cares shes sooooo damn good looking but i digress nothing new here bottomline hot girl group gets taken advantage of some one gets hooked on drugs someone gets hooked on a guy some one gets the hell out and then the horrible stuff happens surprise surprise welcome to the music business i cant believe so many people out there think this is a good movie so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies i dont play that if you want to support these films by going to see them  great if you enjoyed it  super to each his own but dont try to tell me it was good pleeeease i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors wanna see a good africanamerican movie see love jones ray or the color purple those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin why because they told compelling stories with great acting that made you feel something long after you left the theater just because its our experience does not automatically make it a good film its only good  when its good period
