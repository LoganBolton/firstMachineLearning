tim robbins is oddly benign here cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einsteins niece although hes onscreen much of the time robbins cancels out the innerworkings of his intense persona and fades into the background its easy to forget hes even in the picture lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick that being walter matthau playing einstein who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character otherwise its sugary and sunny directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi who shows heart but no wit or brains meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother  from
