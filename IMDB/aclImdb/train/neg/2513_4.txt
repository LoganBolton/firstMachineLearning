when i first saw this film i thought it should have come from the childrens section  its very fun and at times humorous and is actually quite a good story but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein and his performance is extraordinary but thats the sole exception this film appears a bit forced the directing lacks substance and oh yeahthe music is ridiculously awful it didnt put me in a very good mood but if you are not expecting a smart wellcrafted comedyromance tale then this certainly can be entertaining like i saidit should be in the childrens section einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins boring almost tense quest to steal meg ryans heart a very conflicting film but as long as its not taken seriously this can be an alright movie
