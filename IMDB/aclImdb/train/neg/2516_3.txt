sadly i dont remember the book anymore but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace this film represents a typical german production of low quality it does not hold my attention  although the story itself is good it is just badly adabted at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated  they have no nuances in their performances even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy arent cannot rescue this poor spectacle however theres hope  ive been told that the films following this one are getting better and better so in conclusion i must say that this film doesnt deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon
