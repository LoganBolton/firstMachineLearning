i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screenbr br boy was i disappointed this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable george c scott is an excellent actor but in this it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 of the time the rest of the time he was quite flatbr br i realize that this was made in 84 precg effects for the most part but it looked to be very bmovie quality especially the encounter with jacob marleybr br the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastimebr br i will admit that mr scott did a good job with the reformed scrooge at the end that was a refreshing portrayalbr br i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and downtrodden and tiny tim oh dont even get me started on bad child actors
