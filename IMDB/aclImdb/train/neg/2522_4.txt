what an awful movie the idea of robots fighting each other is cool but the storyline is ridiculous real human action laughable acting nonexistent and special effects on which this type of movie must depend are archaic i thought it must have been made around 8084 and was amazed to see it was from 1990 thats 5 years after aliens ok lots of people said it was good considering the low budget but i just think whats the point it looks totally unbelievable i wouldnt mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other
