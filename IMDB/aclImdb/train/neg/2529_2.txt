bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex so he buys a van to aid in this quest the acting is lame the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time but fell a long way short they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin because this will supposedly add comedic valuebr br im struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film if you like devito this is another classic devito kind of role  but hes only a supporting actor and there for cliché value
