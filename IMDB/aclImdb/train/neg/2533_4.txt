i agree with most if not all of the previous commenters tom bighouseazyahoocom the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitementbr br i have seen zatoichi 1131516 i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 usa zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing the story line was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines at one point i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi filmbr br this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects a head rolling limbs severed blood and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action and won a great following without having to resort to effectsbr br i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend this is the first zatoichi film from his studio i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films  and recommend them
