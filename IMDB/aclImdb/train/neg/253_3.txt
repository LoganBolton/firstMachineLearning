the premise of the movie has been explained and if youve gotten this far you dont me to pretend that im a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low im a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3 and some others manybr br the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a highschoolers approach to cinema for the rest of us well find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes this does take away from the film the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis and the actingwellhmmm br br if one is a takashi fan youll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality see the neverending story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one br br as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with cowriting but that doesnt mean much as non of what wed hope would be miikes personality would spill over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photographybr br the movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the groundbr br my suggestion is if youre just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ichi and audition then movie into his works like blues harp fudoh rainy dog bird people of china
