not that all disney films are garbagebr br anyway i saw legend of boggy creek first and absolutely loved the film when i heard it had 2 sequels i was ecstatic i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night i dont see how they can make a grated sequel to a horror film the original is a moviedocumentary about the fauke monster and can scare anyone return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone i dont remember the plot too well as its been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again but its about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them a big monsoon comes through the hunters get hurt are saved by the kids then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm then all of a sudden bigfoot comes and does something really sick i dont wanna ruin the ending for any of yas but its not scary well
