i havent seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the kidnapperbr br yea lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte johnsonbr br i was a little bored that johnson was so seriousbr br and yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the bluebr br i was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldnt be nostalgic over it not yet anywaybr br there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out
