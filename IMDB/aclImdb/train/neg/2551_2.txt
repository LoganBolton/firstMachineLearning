mislead by the terrible lie on the cover fun as american pie my girlfriend and i sat in front of the tv waiting for a comedy and this is definitely not one you probably wont laugh one time if youre not one of those jackasslike everteeny minds its not even an erotic movie which would at least been something given that its about sexbr br so what is this the erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity zero in originality i remember losing it for one and his gang of friends the rest of the characters ie the girls just come and go for no credible reason come on there are even dwarfs so simple dwarves are fun ho ho the acting is very tvlike as is the video look throughout the movie and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girlsbr br awful movie amateurish badly produced and over all not funny kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes other than that dont even think of renting this movie
