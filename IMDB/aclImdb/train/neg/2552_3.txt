this is listed as a documentary its not its filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an american pie style comedy its not that eitherbr br basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid throw is a couple of dwarfs also on the same sort of quest and you have a nonhilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girlsbr br considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plentybr br if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this
