this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks ive seen the length wasnt nearly long enough to include a good storyline also the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure and the dad is shot by a police officer i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for but it could have been better also the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over after hearing all of lucys name and figuring out it was lucifer i wanted to gag yes its interesting that lucifer was a woman but look at the name its a males name it should be given to a male character all in all the movie was a bore and could have used a better plot
