well its all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said whats to be said but the thing is i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that ive seen so i have to write somethingbr br the acting is stupid its truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be dont they realize that even ripoffs can still be scary we dont see how the granpa is killed the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die you just dont sympathize with them and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better we just hear him scream and we see nothing
