i actually like asylum movies ive made it a habit to see as many as possible even the ripoffs theyve done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls this is just plain lame i cant believe that the same people who made dead men walking and draculas curse actually made this movie too its not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction which by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate andor forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie but this film takes itself way too seriously i really hope that snakes on a train is better now thats a movie i cant wait to see
