i was supposed to review this for a website and i watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off and it didnt even do that well enoughbr br 666 the child is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers ive ever seen even worse than godsend with scenes that rip from the omen without shame the ending is even very similar to the way the omen ends br br not to mention that the acting writing and story are all just hackneyed if these movies make money im sad to see where asylum is headed its embarrassing
