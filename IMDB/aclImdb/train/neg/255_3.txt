are you familiar with concept of childrens artwork while it is not the greatest picasso any threeyearold has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles well this concept of childrens artwork is how i felt about fuquas depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see fuquas style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid unchained performance there are certain scenes which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why fuquas name appears on so many best ofÂ… film listsbr br i will never disagree with someone that fuquas eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasnt jumped aboard this bandwagon even in the silly feature bait you are witness to fuquas greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are unless you are charlie kaufmann you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it he did notbr br then there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be adlibed and what should be used to further the plot instead we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first an actor second fuqua should have stopped this immediately foxxs jokes destroyed his character which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of instead of character development he would crack a joke neither style worked no joke was funny the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles they were brining nothing new to the table nothing solid to the story and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film they were pawns filling in dead air space fuqua had no control over this mess and the final verdict only supports that accusationbr br overall this was a sad film with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand foxx was annoying without character lines and a complete bag of cheese in each scene i saw no emotion and when emotion was needed to convey a message he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues are my words harsh i dont think so when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity some edible characters and themes that seem to hit close to home bait contained none of these while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film the remaining five hundred were disastrous apparently i took the bait when renting this film but now having seen it hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibblebr br grade  out of  for his two scenes that were fun to watch
