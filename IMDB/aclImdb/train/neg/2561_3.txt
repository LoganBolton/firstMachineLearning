666 the child starts as a plane crashes the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named donald boo boo stewart who is adopted by news reporter erika sarah lieving  her cameraman husband scott lawson adam vincent after they covered the incident for channel 6 news at first donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around after warnings from a nun  vicar scott begins to believe that donald is evil  the cause of all the deathsbr br this straighttodvd horror flick was directed by jake perez under the pseudonym jake jackson  one has to say 666 the child is really rather poor whenever i see the asylum is responsible for a film i get worried i get very worried since their track record is awful they seem to specialise in making or distributing low budget horror films which are usually ripoffs of some recent successful big budget horror film  in the case of 666 the child you dont need a degree in rocket science to realise that its a complete ripoff to cash in on the recent the omen 2006 which was released the same year the script by benjamin henry  austin laurel is terrible  simply cant match the ambitions of the the hollywood equivalent i mean just what exactly does donald the antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town its hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it every character in 666 the child is some form of the main characters from the omen the adopted parents the priest who tries to warn them  the sinister babysitter theres a real lack of incident theres barely any gore  the plot is poor i mean donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random  needless what were all the disgusting pictures donald drew all about where did the babysitter come from  theres just nothing that ties everything together  its just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly the references to the number 6 also becomes annoying  are very unsubtlebr br director perez does alright i suppose its competent if nothing else theres virtually no blood or gore theres a few sprays of blood a cut off hand  someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen its certainly not scary theres no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house  theres no tension because we never really know what donald is trying to do  there fore theres no threat from himbr br technically the film is alright its reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference the acting isnt that great but at the same time ive seen worsebr br 666 the child is a poor mans the omen ripoff id sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week not good  definitely not recommended followed by the sequel 666 the beast 2007 which also went straighttodvd
