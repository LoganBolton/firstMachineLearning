there are just so many things wrong with this moviebr br to begin with the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten the overall movie is mercifully short already but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the mean lion how did the miss a reference to the wiz on that one and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot in short the script had the seed of a good idea but needed quite a bit of reworkingbr br second it could have done without the crude humor the original also had some that it could have done without but at least there it was almost an afterthought  here flatulence and urination aboundbr br third the show is a little too selfaware the original series had that well enough as did the first movie but here its just way way too much the brendan fraser injokes were just a bit over the top and why no mention of the new ursula other gags with the narrator especially a couple of interactions near the end also exceed good sensebr br fourth a bit more attention could have been given to the cgi work in the first it was hard to tell that shemp wasnt a real elephant except by behavior of course but here the cgi stands out like a sore thumb ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether theyre good or bad and they at least do succeed on that count so its a relatively small problem but its still therebr br all that said christopher showermans performance as george is decent enough it lacks brendan frasers charm but christopher only really fails in that specific comparison  he even managed to give george a bit of personal depth which should have been a major foul in a jay wardinspired movie but wasnt here julie benz as the new ursula surprised me as being even better than leslie mann in the originalbr br most other performances were pretty standard not standing out in my mind as either good or bad
