dear me peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been but his choice of films say after 1964 was very unfortunate he didnt seem to realize how to use his talents he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did of his later films only the optimists of nine elms and being there have impressed me of those i have seenbr br that said the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad  i have yet to see carlton browne and heavens above  at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree but theres a girl in my soup really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers part in terms of character in his films from 195564 you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles here you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead its almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality he certainly does not convince try as he might or create an interesting character he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed forbr br hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry this is no easy genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy it is very artificial seeming all the way through  i know that it is part of danvers character that he is a dry procurer of ladies but he doesnt really change from that in a way that convinces sellers has a very grating way of playing charm as well this character really has no depth and really does not gain the viewers sympathy or interest sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty iconoclastic performance in lolitabr br there really is nothing to say about the plot direction or characters as frankly they leave little or no impression this is truly one of the most anaemic complacent misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen a nonentity of a vehicle for sellers undisputed talentsbr br rating  12
