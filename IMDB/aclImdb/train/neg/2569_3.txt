peter sellers one of my favorite actors is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie hawns youth just after her oscar win cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud as a skirtchasing celeb in his 40s sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degreebr br a 3 out of 10 best performance   nicky henson plays a young study typebr br i hope hawn and sellers were paid well because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 a very good year for films  catch22 mash husbands joe wusa five easy pieces and many others you cant win them all
