i read that theres a girl in my soup came out during peter sellerss low period watching the movie im not surprised almost nothing happens in the movie seemingly the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie it doesnt the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything maybe i havent seen every movie about middleaged to elderly people trying to be hippies but this one gives such movies a pretty bad namebr br all in all both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this so dont waste your time on this pretty worthless
