with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one wont go wrong but what can i say this was a horrible misfire the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove itbr br that song about Â‘arabella cinderella is pretty cool but that is it i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie this is almost the definition of one i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times in terms of its definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing not to mention the direction is just so out there br br peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss he will go from dr strangelove and being there throughout his career to dumb movies like this and the magic christian which was very similar to this one in context and style but that movie did have a few funny moments this one is senseless and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie not recommended for anyone
