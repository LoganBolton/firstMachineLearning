i know that movies arent necessarily supposed to mirror reality but this one got on my nerves it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about psychological trauma and mental illness the psycho mom thing has been done too many times before and usually done better and much of the rest of the plot is farfetched as well the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave aboutbr br one highlight i am a longtime fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular jon lindstrombr br anyway if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it in the same way a person must suspend reality  judgment when watching a lot of movies then this movie might be tolerable if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standardsbr br im sorry i spent my time watching it
