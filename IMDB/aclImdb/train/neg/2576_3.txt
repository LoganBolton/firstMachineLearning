the waterdance 1991 the main character of the waterdance played by eric stoltz finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured and there he must face an harsh new life confined to a wheelchair its an interesting and promising premise but unfortunately it fails to deploy what ensues instead is largely hollywood schmaltz with some interesting moments certainly the cast eric stoltz william forsythe wesley snipes et al is brilliant and perform well here as one would expect but their talents are wasted the characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable the snipes character being the exception i suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through peoples ideas about the handicapped being crippled or weak by depicting them for the most part as inyourface pricks but it makes for an entirely annoying experience admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through in a way that is not softened or romanticized which is useful and a good idea but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with and thats worth dealing with it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be to varying degrees despicable they wouldnt have to be disneyfied either surely theres a middle ground somewhere by the films conclusion the eric stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end we couldnt care less br br in addition to its character problems the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many hollywood movies suffer from the syndrome doesnt really have an official name but you might call it inexplicable forgiveness syndrome it goes something like this characters abuse the crap out of each other and then without so much as an apology all is forgiven an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie the breakfast club in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot as a resultÂ…they love him in one of the the latest examples spiderman 3 supervillain the sandman lays waste to a chunk of manhattan then wails on spiderman for what seems like about 15 monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to bye now the most egregious example of ifs in the waterdance is a sequence in which after being called the nword by william forsythes racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene the wesley snipes character whoops it up with the same forsythe character in the next scene as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence again without so much as an oh yeah sorry about that business back there where i you know called you the nword it makes me wonder do these people actually watch these movies before they release them or do they just film them with their eyes closed kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number and call it a days work
