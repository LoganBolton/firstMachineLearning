i love jamie foxxbr br and i enjoy 99 of all movies i seebr br and i walked out of this onebr br now i admit it may have had something to do with the two middleaged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing oh no jamies knocking on a door hee hee hee but this was just so incredibly annoying there could be no sustained camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle everything had to be inyourface loud and annoyingbr br the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovichlike but at this point its just old and tired he brought nothing new or interesting from all the characters too many lines you saw coming too many youve heard before and too many tough guy lines and i dont mind that sort of thing really as long as theres a bit of originality to it in fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just suckedbr br i love jamie foxx and i think hes really funny and i thought he was funny in this movie but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else br br this movie needed less shootemup less annoying camera shots more emotion more feeling and more jamie foxx i gave it a 2
