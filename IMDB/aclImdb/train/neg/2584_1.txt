so american pie beta house is the 6th american pie movie in the series although it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it cant that guy get better gigsbr br there is very little to compliment this movie on there arent any funny jokes the acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a canadians impersonation of a british woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word yall this movie makes me feel like such an idiot why didnt i apply to a college where nobody goes to class but everybody gets good grades girls consistently take their clothes off in public everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and stis and you can ejaculate all over a girls family photos without her minding really this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn maybe for the next one theyll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead im sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character stiflers 3rd uncle once removed or something like that
