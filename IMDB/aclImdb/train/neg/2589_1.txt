for those with little time on their hands ill sum it up quickly in one wordpathetic there are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description so much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes you got it the reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap you can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for br br ive watched many a movie franchise decline over the years but american piebeta house has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie its still a thousand times funnier than this dreckbr br the plot is predictable and sometimes you actually feel like youre watching a school play the things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it were talking star wars levels of suspension like the kind you need to convince yourself jar jar is realbr br the plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke there is no acting talent to speak of all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh and ohhh how they fail every gag falls flat and the only thing i laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be how else can you explain the bullst they try to pass off as a storybr br they pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written lowest common denominator nonsense the characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of beta house but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening its a very lazy way of telling a story it also misses opportunities to be funny in doing soimagine say the wizard of oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it and all we see is dorothy highfiving the scarecrow every now and again and saying gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then lazy lazy lazybr br the female characters have little or nothing to say all they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie you braindeads that only seek ta will not be disappointed but for that reason alone shame on you if you buy this on dvd you will be contributing to the downfall of society in your own special way congratulations
