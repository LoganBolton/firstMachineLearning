are you kidding that was awful br br but that notwithstanding i got given this film and 3 others and they were all on dvd the film starts of pretty much an ok movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwardsbr br and the ending well lets just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for youbr br 310
