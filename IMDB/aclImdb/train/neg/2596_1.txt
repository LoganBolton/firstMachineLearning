dear god i kept waiting for this movie to get started then i waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither i just sat there dumbfounded that 1 it could possibly be this bad and 2 that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity i had faith that drew couldnt possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy did i ever lose my faith dont bother with this one drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived i cant believe a script this bad ever got funded it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it still didnt go anyplace its just pitiful where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasnt the worst baffles me because believe me if it got any worse id have slit my wrists before finishing it
