i got the dvd very cheap and im a total drewbie and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyonebr br an early drew movie shes looking great and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her like a shower scene a sexy dance scene quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent moviesbr br the movie itself is pretty average or subaverage and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesybr br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly dont understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you dont get the end you would be expecting and it also comes much sooner than one would have expectedbr br overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies
