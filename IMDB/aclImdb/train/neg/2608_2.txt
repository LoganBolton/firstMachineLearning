my 10yearold daughter alexandra writesbr br i thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from 101 dalmatians i couldnt wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning  they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
