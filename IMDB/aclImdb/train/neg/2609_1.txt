this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile after seeing it my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining this is a good example of a concept only filmthey have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make  just based on the initial conceptbr br the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore themshe simply couldnt hurt a flea this doesnt last too long after her release and shes back to her old ways periodbr br the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate himand that is tough considering i am a diehard python fan it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money there cant be any other reason cruellas low selfesteem servant tim mcinnerny was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny and it must have cost a few bucks to get g√©rard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were i am trying to block them out of my mindbr br overall youd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel
