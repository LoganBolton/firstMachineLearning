i dont know why but for some sick reason i think since ive been on the disney sequel binge i decided to just go ahead and see 102 dalmations the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de vil it seemed like a sure hit but it was just a bomb i think the reason why these movies dont work is because 101 dalmations the original was a cartoon it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults this was not really that fun because its adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings i understand theyre trying to make sure that its appealing to the kids but its ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film and 102 dalmationss story isnt really that goodbr br cruella de vil has been in prison for a while but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being but her reputation is now damaged as a puppynapper but she buys a mans dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like shes changed but when she sees her probation officers dalmatians she goes crazy and starts seeing spots and she looses it shes back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that dalmation coat shes always wantedbr br glenn close is such an amazing actress very under rated but her taking on cruella de vil shes good but lets face it this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case also as cute as the puppies were it just works more for the animation it sounds stupid but its just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix i wouldnt really recommend 102 dalmations its alright but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time this is just the same thingbr br 210
