this film was pure pain sitting in the theater for xamount of minutes i was wondering when the film was going to start all the setups were in place typical love story characters have to overcome their shortgivings villain has to emerge but none of it ever initiated by the time these things happened i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective in scenes that required immense tension and buildup it felt like necessary frames were cut kids stuff does not have to be this way childrens films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones the excuse hey  its for kids is bull ill take sword in the stone any day this was terrible im getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days and as for the kids the 10year i saw this with will agreepure trash
