this film is horribly acted written directed and produced but its so campy its actually semiwatchable thats semi watchablebr br the storyline what little there is makes virtually no sense whatsoever the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds br br many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials none of them went on to anything else that im aware of and of course sly stallones even less talented brother well br br trivia it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont ont about 20 miles neast of toronto i recognized many local landmarksintersectionsbuildings i think the drivein scene was filmed at the now demolished oshawa drivein just before it was torn down
