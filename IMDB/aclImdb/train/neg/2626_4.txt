i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals where we would set out to rent a bunch of bmovies and vote for who picked the worstbr br the night we watched this it was voted the best due to semblance of plot and fun costumingbr br this is certainly a silly kitschy movie to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching lowbudget fluff personally however i wouldnt recommend additional substances  this movie will leave its own mark on youbr br it made enough of an impression on me that ive actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few yearsbr br a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies this one is fun and i remember bouncy music
