jamie foxx is my favorite comedian however i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker martin lawrence and dave chapple who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept see money talks blue streakbr br okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream or in living colors tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lees satire bamboozled
