it saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors locations and genres ie douglas sutherland washington dc and political thriller but the sentinel really hits a low its like they had a great idea up front signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger not only do i feel shes one of the worst actors in hollywood but im still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one and definitely the only bad actor in the film to win an acting oscar for la confidential but she wasnt the only problem sutherland who i love as jack bauer on 24 once again playsÂ…jack i miss his old a time to kill or a few good men days douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in plot someone some secret service traitor wants the president dead and douglas is haphazardly being framed will someone believe him actually no spoiler here as quickly as they came up with that subplot halfway through its over before you know it and why did someones want the president dead is that to be revealed in the sequel too many plot holes too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable the sentinel is if you only see one movie a year you may not know who the mole is but anyone whos familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one law  order episode youll know in the first few frames was it terrible not really the cinematography was good and despite sutherland playing jack again hes still got it
