ive been willing to put up with a lot from latespringsummer action fluff movies but in general thats been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff ie cool special effects interesting plot twists comic value steve buscemi etc this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longorias cleavage an issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot suspense back story character development continuity etc i would get into specifics but quite frankly ive alreadymaybe willinglyforgotten most of the moviebr br the entire time i was in the theater i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd save your money on this one folks unless you really really really like eva longorias cleavage
