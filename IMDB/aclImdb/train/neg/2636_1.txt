i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening and despite the fact that i didnt pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off ladies and gentlemen time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat the acting is torpid at best kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zetajones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey eva longoria is a nonentity she looks like shes reading her lines off a teleprompter and if you cant spot the mole within the first 20 minutes then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller rent in the line of fire if you see and buy into this one youll start to fear for the presidents safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grownup versions of the kinds from 90210 no matter what your feelings about w lets hope this art does not imitate life
