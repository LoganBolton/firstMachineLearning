trying to conceive of something as insipid as the sentinel would be pretty difficult the problems are many the result is terrible and loaded with plot holesbr br michael douglas stars as pete garrison a secret service agent who took one for reagan during the attempt on his life years later we find pete assigned to the whitehouse family mainly as a guard for the first lady kim basinger la confidential troubles arise as we see petes close involvement with the first lady and a sudden threat against the president himself david rasche united 93 when pete fails a polygraph test hes singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator david breckinridge kiefer sutherland 24 tv seriesbr br as the presidential assassination plot unfolds pete finds himself on the run from his own people his only confidant is the first lady and shes reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why pete failed the polygraph in the first place but is pete really innocent or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president if he is innocent how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the secret service br br the one big overwhelming problem with this film is that theres no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat isnt that what the movies supposed to be about one would think so but the audience is never let in on why the assassins want to kill the prez hmm someone forget to put that in the script somewhere br br and whats with david breckinridges kiefers new partner jill marin eva longoria carlitas way seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of acandy what was her purpose again did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a lowcut blousebr br there are so many problems with the basic premise of the sentinel as to be laughable the action is too easily stymied by the what the responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie
