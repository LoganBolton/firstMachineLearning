ill say one thing for jeanette and nelsoneven when stranded in a mirthless witless painfully inept musical like this theres still that twinkle in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway nonexistent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievableyes even for a fantasybr br truth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own reallife husband gene raymond in smilin through which nonetheless was a considerably better filmbr br sorry i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one hep number with binnie barnesand nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situationsbr br one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess its like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting castbr br summing up painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical cant recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if jeanettes closeups still glow with her gossamer beauty this film is jawdroppingly bad
