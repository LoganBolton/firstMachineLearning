the first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on unless you read the book  which i had notbr br if you can stick with the first half the second half is sweet  predictable yes but sweet nonethelessbr br the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80s not 2005br br no standout moments bland but it moved along without boring mebr br i would like to know why keaton selected this role her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance
