i cant believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and i feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs when one of the main characters announces that hes gay twice in the first five minutes dont ignore it as typical pc nonsense and figure it has to get better because it wont if his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesnt make you sick then be thankful the freak who wrote andor directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint i mean get real its one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flicks supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of closure over the sudden death of her daughter what does one thing have to do with the other one might be tempted to ask apparently the two issues are inextricably interwoven and if that werent bad enough theres the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor i mean seriously hasnt that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis why must she go around like that at the very least how about shaving the ugly thing off and while youre at it have those horrible moles removed too would you slurp up some ice cream she just served you i think not it must be a new jersey thing br br youd think diane keaton might save this piece of drek but think again was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse i dont even wanna think about it so what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter this grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and thats all there is to it one wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going none of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant trust me  pass this piece of crap up its not about death a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it its a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director
