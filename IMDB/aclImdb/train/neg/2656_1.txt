very light spoilers maybe br br normally a fan of diane keaton i tried to watch this tonight i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother both came across as selfabsorbed with little regard for others with the daughter also adding in rude disrespectful and reckless to the mix when the daughter died the only thing i thought was at least we wont have to watch her anymore keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving but it was too far gone for me by then i simply wasnt enjoying it so i stopped watching if you want me to care for the protagonist you need to get me caring about the characters much soonerif its nearly an hour in and i dont care its too latebr br the supporting cast was sincere and well playedi felt for themand the gay best friend was wonderful but even combined that wasnt enough to carry the film for me
