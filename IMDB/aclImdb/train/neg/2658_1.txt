watching cbss surrender dorothy i kept wondering why diane keaton would want to be in it not because its a television moviewith the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses it isnt any wonder why academy award winning performers such as keaton turn to tvbut because it offers no opportunities for keaton to shine a single mother grieving the sudden death of her twentysomething daughter imposes uponand gradually becomes friends withthe group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident adapted from the novel this teleplay gives us a group of selfabsorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us hes gay hears diane keaton say surrender dorothy and actually asks thats from the wizard of oz rightno genius its from citizen kane keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death she tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage lots of kooky outfits but it doesnt sit well with the viewer since keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way here shes a crazed harpy who doesnt learn many lessons on her journey of selfdiscovery the movie quickly forgets its about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her this is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat it should help a lot of grieving mothers out there i cant imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer muddled and baffling its deranged
