german nut case j√∂rg buttgereit apparently has fans  but i dont know why and im definitely not one of them the only buttgereit film id seen previously was nekromantik and i hated every minute of it but  shockingly  this film is worse der todesking is pointless in the same way as nekromantik but its a worse film because its boring in a way that few movies have ever managed its not far off the blair witch project seriously some people say that this film is sick and shocking but it really isnt the director may have been making a point about death but only he knows what it is how anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me the film revolves around the theme of suicide and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week yes that means we have a pointless and boring episode for monday a pointless and boring episode for tuesday a pointless and boring episode for wednesday etc etc this film manages to be even more boring than my average week br br der todesking is apparently an art film although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to art each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story  but it doesnt we just get a quick little sketch on suicide and it only makes you wonder what the point is the film feels like it should be deep but theres a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it buttgereit uses a few evocative images but im unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isnt that memorable theres a shot involving a decomposing mans body that features fairly often but that gets old pretty quick and all youre left with is the rest of the film which is unfortunate if i were to struggle for good things to say about this crap all i can think of is this the title sounds cool as i mentioned nekromantik is the only other film ive seen from this amateur director i have copies of schramm and nekromantik 2 and now im really in no rush to watch either der todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it art is very much mistaken give it a miss
