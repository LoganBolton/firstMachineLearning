do not be suckered into renting this movie it has nothing to do with an escape from death row despite the english title i cant think of a single good thing to say about the movie poor acting poor editing poor directing laughable plot and the soundmusic was so irritating its a wonder this movie doesnt come with a warning label the only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for its historical cheesiness quality they just dont make films this bad anymore
