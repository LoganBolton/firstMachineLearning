i cant say im all that experienced in misty mundae flicks having seen only a handful but its obvious that this was made on a shoestring and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a tomb raider ripoff inside a garage it isnt because its completely obvious that this is what they were doing the film only runs for forty five minutes and this is definitely a good thing as there isnt nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer it has something to do with an evil nazi scientist who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a nazi scientist ever could a mummy which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and misty  this films version of tomb raider who keeps her top on for much less time than angelina jolie did in the big budget version i have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings this film could have been better its got misty mundae for a start and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter darian caine the pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a seduction cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot although that isnt really a bad thing obviously this is a rubbish film  but the fact that its short is to its credit and if youre after a bit of lesbian sex you could do worse
