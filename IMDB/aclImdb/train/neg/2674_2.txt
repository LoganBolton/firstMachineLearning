someone had a great idea lets have misty mundae do her own rrated version of lara croft  firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits but topless as well it was indeed a great idea the problem is that the people who had it couldnt come up with any sort of script or budget to support it therefore we get a film that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts often in slowmotion and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage the appeal of misty mundae is still evident she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girlnextdoor beauty however her two female costars here with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene are nowhere near her league if mummy raider was presented as a youtube video id rate it higher but as a film destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than 12 a  out of 4
