its a really cheesy parody of tomb raider and some indiana jones the humors cheesy and so is the acting but after all it is a soft core movie which is expected and doesnt matter because what you really want is the sex which gets me to the biggest problem of all there barely is any of it which makes you feel like youre watching tv at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid thats going nowhere in that industry youre left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen then just left hanging the onemaybe two or one with two partsthat actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though i personally cant recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two if you lucking for a good movie with a plot and good acting you dont want this if you looking for a good soft core lesbian film you dont want this either
