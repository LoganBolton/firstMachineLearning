a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this filmbr br in fact what is the point of itbr br the scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storylinebr br the performances of the cast are questionable if not believablebr br did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequelbr br
