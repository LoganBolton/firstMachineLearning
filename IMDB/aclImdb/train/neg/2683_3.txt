have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills 90210 were thrown into a thai jailif so this is your movie this is midnight express for the mtv crowd that would be ok but the story was poorly executed contrived plot twists poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound this slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot linethe faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out this moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint later the same hotel employee is somehow foundand bangkok is a big city mind you ive been there and testifies against the girls as if a couple of free mai tais warrant 40 years in prison cmon rent another day in paradise instead
