i have never panned a film online but i felt moved to do so after seeing this one one doesnt show up at someones funeral and say to the bereaved my relatives died so why should i care about yoursbr br minus the propaganda there was little if anything that could be called art as the daughter of deaf parents i was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated not ignored itbr br the word chutzpah comes to mind as a writer there are few subjects i would stay away from the holocaust is one this is another i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant and inept
