in order to avoid confusion let me clarify a couple of points i am not a red neck i am not even a moderate nor a conservative quite on the contrary i am a radical a libertarian im not a wasp either i was not even born in the statesbr br jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry by and for showoffs and i dare say by and for people who have no sense of decency or for that matter respect for other peoples life or death especially when the victims are thought to be mostly bloody imperialists killed in yankee soil i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive just plain awful why didnt they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism anybody who is serious about filmmaking and serious about life and death should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and nonsequiturs with two exceptions the episode of burkina faso  almost amusing  and the one from india which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack on the basis that afterwards he didnt return home and that he was an american muslim and truth be told when the facts were known he was honored as a hero all other nine episodes essentially and extremely boring and emotionless can be listed in two different categoriesbr br first i dont care about the thousands of victims americans foreigners children youngsters adults oldtimers and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion makhmalbafs iran lelouchs france  im afraid im going to commit an heresy since its lelouchs but maybe his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original tanovics bosniaherzegovina gonzalez inarritus mexico gitaïs israel penns usa br br second the bloody yankees deserve it and can be resumed in frustration and hatred chahine egypt vindicates the suicide bombers loach uk considers the 911 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the usa to the chilean dictatorship headed by the serialkiller augusto pinochet in fact someone should inform mr loach that the victims of pinochet were not related to alqaida and that chile is a south american country which sole existence mr bin laden should have ignored he ought to be informed too that the american government sanctions against the chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountries and imamura japan windingly points out that wwii is related the attack to the wtc imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake it pretends to be obscure it is instead quite ludicrousbr br theres some kind of error shared by many including some americans and it consists in the belief that this movie wasnt commercially screened in the states because of some kind of censorship nothing further from the truth this movie wasnt screened in the states because it is a complete fiasco a fiasco of the wackyest kind even in buenos aires where peronism and other forms of fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants and antiamericanism is in vogue the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters and was applauded by a very select public the usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally quaint spectacles like the sight of a mcdonalds fastfood restaurant or perchance an elderly jew being burnt to ashes
