hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting id suggest it if thou you happen to like cheap bmovies like me its good for a giggle other than that i wouldnt suggest that you rent it id wait till it comes on the tube say round 4 am on the free access channel of your cablesatellite supplier the band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews i could find on them so once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how not to shoot a low budget movie
