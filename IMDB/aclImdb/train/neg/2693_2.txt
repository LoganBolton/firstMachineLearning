br br although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the storybr br one may believe that middleclass teenage school girls in the 1950s easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30yearolds they barely know but i doubt itbr br one may believe that young high school teens are highly selfconfident and selfassured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult worldbr br one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin  the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes  and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake but i think notbr br one may believe that 30somethingyearold troublemakers can enter into and hang around inside a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent thisbr br one final nit throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome but because it was never detailed each reference distracts from each scenebr br this movie did not ring true for me
