warningit contains spoilers if a movie starts with a sex scene then its a bad movie see for example 300 this one confirms the above lemma the second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action the fact that we know the end makes the movie boring even more other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times and this made more frustrated to compensate the consequent lack of suspense we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters and oh yes they have lots to show andy phoffman for example is a drug addict more he is cheating his wife more he plans to rob his father more his wife is cheating with his brother more he doesnt regret his complicity to his mothers death more he is a serial killer more etc etc its not enough space to write here i wonder how could he have a top job and why his wife didnt leave him before on the other hand i enjoy much the performances of the actor hoffmanbr br even here psh saves what is left from my 7 spent for this absurdity why absurdity because it doesnt have sense why should i care for the despicable characters another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic at least pleasant character br br also its a lot of sentimentality for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parentslives before the crime
