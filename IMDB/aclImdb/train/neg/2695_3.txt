when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdbs views on a film and until this one had never seen a flick rated 70 or above on the site i did not enjoybr br sidney lumet a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can filling a films cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoeverbr br i like films with flawed characters but no matter how dark someones personality is we all have a bit of light in there too were all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others mr lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitchblack charactersbr br ethan hawkes hank is a 30something whining immature irresponsible manchild divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks hes a loser which he very much is his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because hes too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film its more pathetic than uplifting ethan hawke plays his character well but isnt given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesnt particularly care that its therebr br speaking of which his characters wife is equally as bad just about every single shot of the film shes in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already nonexistent selfesteem with insults seriously thats just about all the character does her harpylike behavior borders on malevolentbr br albert finney plays their father charles and while mr finney has been a great actor for many decades he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open halfgrimace on his face like hes suffering from the worlds worst bout of constipation for someone whos been an actor as long as mr finney you think hed be more apt at emoting even though he doesnt show it much his character is supposedly grief stricken and angerfilled and when he smothers andy at the films conclusion its akin to dr frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of its own miserybr br marisa tomei isnt given much to do with her character stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason when andys world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship but it really doesnt make her any less selfish or selfserving than any other character in the film but probably the one with the most common sense at leastbr br and finally we come to andy played by the always good philip seymour hoffman is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 his performance of the heroinaddicted embezzling financial executive whos perfect crime of robbing his parents insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic hoffmans character ends up being the films chief villain but its hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father whos selfadmitted poor early parenting led to his sons eventual psychosis and indirect unintentional murder of his motherbr br ultimately this film is really only worth watching for pshs great performance and its family train wreck nature just dont expect there to be any characters worth cheering for because there really arent
