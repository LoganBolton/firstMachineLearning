i know john singletons a smart guy coz he made boyz n the hood so how did he write and direct this its like the pilot of a bad going away to college for the first time teen soap a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition i guess who wouldve guessed the daterape victim would dump sausage for seafood the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neonazis and would be roomedup with a black and a jew  just for laughs even laurence fishburnes creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy its like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot except busta rhymes of course big ups
