i havent read a single imdb comment for this movie that mentions how the jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist skinhead while the movies lead black character looked in sternness down the barrel of a gunbr br i dont know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life i agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if singleton didnt make his characters such broad caricaturesbr br on the surface he tries to portray ice cubes character as a bad guy provoking remy to become a racist skinhead but who graduates at the end in the movies redeeming epilogue it seems singleton points at white as either unable to empathize i didnt say sympathize with his fellow black student or only able to take the path of a racist skinhead many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotrybr br nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle quite honestly what was the point
