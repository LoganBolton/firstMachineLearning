having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks br br what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know its cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold that doesnt feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like theyre running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and its so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb br br and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt russel sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as russel and not nearly as good an actor as russel and russells way of playing o neill well he was much more cynical andersons o neil is way too soft i liked it that russels version just didnt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie br br michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spaderbr br tealc is a really annoying character he is jaffa not a jaffa just jaffa aaaarrgh a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far tealc speaks talks and acts like a robot ive seen better acting from jean claude van dammebr br and the fact that tealc and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters br br as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with crystals its so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background its an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds br br the xfiles had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993 that was 4 years before sg1 started and they didnt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg1 supposedly had they must have spend all the money on catering because i dont see it on the screen br br incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters
