first of all yes im white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people  bad but black people hating white people  ok because apparently we deserved it where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neonazis and win the neonazi where twice the size  and the chase the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesnt deliver this is a racist movie that reaffirm all the clich√© stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinheadcmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing itbr br save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie
