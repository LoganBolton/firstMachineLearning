minor spoilersbr br well i just sat up late and watched this film mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singletons earlier work like boyz n the hood however i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived clich√©d socalled message movies br br the acting is mainly poorpop stars and models do not necessarily make good actorstake note the situations hard to swallow rape victim becomes overnight lesbianplease but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its onedimensional playersbr br not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural sexual and political ignorance as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems its message is contradictory resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion as for the films conclusion i found it predictable embarrassing exploitative and mildly offensive for a film called higher learning i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever againbr br if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire american history xunless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life
