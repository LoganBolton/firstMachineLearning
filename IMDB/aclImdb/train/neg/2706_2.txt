yes people are racist people are even racist in college thats a good point and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most hamfisted and predictable way possible oh yeah its in college toobr br this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner most of the characters are cartoonish onedimensional caricatures lesbian feminist angry black man that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them the angry black men feel cheated feminists hate men etc one feminist even holds a sign that reads dead men dont rape see what i mean i dont want to give anything away but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist theyll probably behave exactly how you expect them to the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neonazis will act like violent neonazis ill guess youll just have to watch to find out what happensbr br another problem i have with this movie is that its supposed to be gritty and hardhitting but they make nazis the bad guys i agree nazis are evil but thats my point everybody thinks nazis are bad were not breaking any new ground here nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s the film doesnt challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy afterschoolspecial like manner being antirape antiracist and antinazi isnt exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issuebr br higher learning is predictable cartoonish and in a word stupid avoid at all costs
