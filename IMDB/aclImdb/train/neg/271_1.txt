i cannot believe how popular this show is i consider myself an avid scifi fan i have read countless scifi novels and have enjoyed many scifi movies and tv shows i really wouldnt even consider this true scifi every episode i have sat through was like a lame watered down version of a star trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or excitingbr br its basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues talking about something boring who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth with people who look and sound just like humans it seemed extremely low budget the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts and the many attempts at humor fall flat it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it trying to be funny but he is not it is just sadbr br the movie was terrible as well there is so much you can do with a portal through space yet every place the army people go is boring this shows no imagination i actually thought the tv series alien nation from a few years back based on the movie alien nation was much better that show actually had good story lines and decent characters i wasnt crazy about alien nation but compared to this overrated crap it was greatbr br also unlike the great new battlestar galactica series stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely they should have at least updated the cheesy toilet flushing special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate
