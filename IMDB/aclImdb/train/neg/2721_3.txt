im a big fan of 50s scifi but this is not one of my favorites while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper scifi flick the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie its clear he was working with no money because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever i have never seen so much timekilling in a moviebr br there are probably less than 60 seconds of blob footage in the entire movie and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorlywritten runon dialogue it was fun to see steve m and anita c together but good heavenshow could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers
