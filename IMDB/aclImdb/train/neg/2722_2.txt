for the big thinkers among us the intruder is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france that gives socalled art films a bad name the story is something about a bitter old coot louis trebor michel subor who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant but beyond that i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing with no coherent storyline to boast of the movie loses us early on though im perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film br br this muddled snailpaced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes  though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits
