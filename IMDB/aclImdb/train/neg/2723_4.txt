claire deniss movies seem to fall into one of two categories the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate lintrus definitely falls into the first category but its not so awful as trouble every day or jai pas sommeilbr br now ever since i saw chocolat ive made it a point to see every new movie denis makes and i have always been disappointed lintrus was no exception she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one br br you get a lot of the denis regulars an older but still magnificent béatrice dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample cleavage and a couple of nice coats the black guy from trouble every day and jai pas sommeil grégoire colin and that lithuanian or russian girl michel subors character was interesting enough but the camera lingered on him at such length that i got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when somewhere in korea i think he finally got it cut br br there was certainly some actiongruesome murders a mans search for a sonand there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasnt enough to figure it out and two viewings are i fear out of the question for one thing the score was jarring and obtrusive as in beau travail for another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked friday evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets you might appreciate the aesthetics of lintrus otherwise steer clear br br i saw this movie in french and its possible i missed something crucial but the dialogue in a denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double spaced and with ample margins in chocolat the silence is sublime in lintrus its just dull
