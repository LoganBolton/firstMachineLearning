this oddity in the new doris day collection doesnt really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes what she does do however is shine when shes on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day jancie rule shows promise and its a shame she didnt become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the gogetter with aplomb better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well whats best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen youll like this one
