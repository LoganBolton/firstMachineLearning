when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television weve all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the 25th century and silver spoons is this i was young and naive ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhilebr br thankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sg1 is not good the 12 yearold me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless technobabble the writing is beyond insipid so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever youre in troublebr br the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool scifi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like hes half asleep most episodesbr br the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebodys basement the cinematography isnt much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it amazes me that shows with a lot more style like farscape and substance like the reimagined battlestar galactica have smaller less rabid fanbases than this pap it just doesnt deserve it
