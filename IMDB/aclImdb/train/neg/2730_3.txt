whoa boybr br ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him well they exist in many forms but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didnt ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyones praises about how much of an artistic genius he is well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene i know theyre everywhere and i dont even follow the local scene or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripebr br the premise is good and honestly its not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering thats one of the difficulties of doing a documentary we are made to follow two bands the brian jamestown massacre lead by anton and the dandy warhols lead by courtney ive heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie not so the brian jamestown massacre why well from this documentarys perspective because the brian jamestown massacres intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry however instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanitybr br because see anton is a genius because he plays rock music he really understands the evolution of music because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments his music is considered postmodern retro but the future because its rock music he wants to bring out a revolution through rock music okay so lets face it twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids id care to watch a documentary aboutbr br the documentary itself doesnt really lend itself to showcasing any of antons talent because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we dont really have the time to focus on that so instead we watch anton the genius the sociomaniacal loser be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music whether he did or not i wont know because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it what i do know is that then were left with a story about some selfcentered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up why even bother watching that people like anton dont deserve the attention they seek the hope and admiration of all those different people and especially a postfailure paean to lost potential this movie plays like a twohour roughcut vh1 special for a reason he goes on and on about the music but its all about the image and the attention look at the guy look at how he dresses look at how he acts look at how he tries to create controversy because he cant afford marketingbr br honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel and thats because of anyone in this documentary joel is the only person who seems to have any fun maybe its because hes the tambourine man the rest of them are all rock stars they deserve our attention and admiration and interest and engagements they are out there to save rock and roll do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to save rock and roll yeah that was because of anton and its selfish of them not to mention me anton as an inspiration what a load people like anton are best left forgotten this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dullbecause music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless thanks a lot anton your antics ruined music for everyone you touched whatever the opinion to the contrary is and if people in the know about anton disagree and he really was a genius it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that waybr br polarisdib
