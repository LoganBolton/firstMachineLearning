when my deja vu my deja vu aired last season i was pleased scrubs i thought is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clipshow concept instead of replaying footage theyre replaying jokes in a selfaware manner and i really enjoyed itbr br i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong one season later they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do the clip showand it looked like it was put together by the workexperience kid dr coxs shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together as it doesnt appear again until my long goodbye some 4 episodes later i cant imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a wellconstructed sitcom who knows why it was slotted there it just seemed lazy and out of place reminding me largely of episodes that have aired within the past yearbr br three second clips jammed together with background music is a dvd extra for a very rainy day not an episode of primetime television
