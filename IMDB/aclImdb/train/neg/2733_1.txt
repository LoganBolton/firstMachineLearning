i debated as to whether or not i should tick the spoiler box since 99 of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of scrubs it probably doesnt come under the category of a spoilerbr br clip shows grrr we all knew friends was going down the tube when they started with clip showsand five and a half years into scrubs theyve gone and fallen down that holebr br i have to wonder if the writers just couldnt be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves lets show the other funny stuff it didnt workbr br for starters showing all the times that people have fallen down isnt funny when taken out of context its not funny to see todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know why he was dangling by his banana hammockbr br second for what was supposed to be a compilation of jds fantasies one was turks dream another also wasnt his fantasy although i forget whichbr br and thats the problem this episode is totally forgettable weve seen all these things before and the collection of clips of people dancing why thats not funnybr br finally i must admit two of my favourite scrubs moments were shown in the last compilationdr cox realising that ben diedand jd telling him how proud of him he isbr br but even seeing those moments again didnt save the episode the summary says it allbr br worst episode ever bill lawrence please dont let your show go the same way as friends keep it fresh keep it funnyor wrap it up
