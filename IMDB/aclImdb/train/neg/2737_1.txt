there are no spoilers in this review theres nothing to spoilbr br no plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch but this didnt even do that clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ok so perhaps they were short on production time but theyd have been better off skipping this episode entirely what a waste of timebr br im not sure how this got made in fact scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes but somehow this got throughbr br thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode
