i still dont know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing this film wasnt worth the memorex dvdr it was burned on i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents camcorder this is by far the worst movie ever made i truly from the bottom of my heart want to sue aaron yamasato for the two hours he stole from my lifebr br so apparently its supposed to be bad on purpose however if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90minute coil of doodoo youll see that yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick the actors attempt dramatic kickass performances comparable to crimson tide but come closer to the marinebr br the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg the camera angles are awful the story is cmovie at best the plot isnt even good enough to be considered bmovie caliber the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty but is crap like everything else rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies plus the techno score is annoying not because its techno but because its nonstop thats right the music plays in the background the whole time acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is i dont care what the disclaimer claims i dont buy it bots was not made this bad on purpose because it takes itself way too serious for what it was a jokebr br this film was very lowbudget but that is no excuse for its recordsetting suck factor great films are born of substance not budget bots had neitherbr br allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90minute waste of time if i were having a threeway with jessica alba and jessica biel in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on id be out of there quicker than steven seagal in executive decisionbr br undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie two maybe three theyll say its grindhouse chopsocky or cheesy in a good way or its so bad its good those people are idiots a movie is either good or its bad theres no such thing as a good bad movie but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies dont get me wrong there are lots of cornball nottobetakenseriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining slither is one bots is notbr br this suckfest runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion its 90 minutes too long the best thing about this film is the dvd cover so next time youre near the walmart dvd bargain bin take a look at it dont touch it just look and quietly walk away
