spoiler i love branagh love helena bonhamcarter loved them together in mary shelleys frankenstein  but this br br i can understand an actors desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype well they did but really  the script droned on bonhamcarters clothes were tres chic and the occasional speededup madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles movie or the old rowan and martin laughinbr br i never got the point  other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer i never felt that he was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch certainly not amusingbr br bonhamcarters realistic one supposes attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in full montybr br the poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrackbr br go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it donate this to pbsbr br
