i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing my first reaction was oh god not again its so hip to play a retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable for some reason though i stayed and watched it til the end maybe it was my faith in the actors hoping theyd give me something to cheer aboutbr br and surely ken and helena can act also the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a pointbr br helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity then again she has a soft side thats just looking for love the only thing that surprised me even more was branaghs characterthis was a triumph of acting the movie itself is nothing uniquebr br see if you are an acting studentif youre looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one its sean penn serious oh my that was a bit harsh it does feature a couple jokesnot for escapists though
