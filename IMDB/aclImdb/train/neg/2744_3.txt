i was bored around 10pm so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangsterbr br its pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy the main character doesnt eat the worms then the world will endbr br this is a good movie for little kids excluding the fact that a 5 year old says penis but not for teens or adults who dont want to waste their time
