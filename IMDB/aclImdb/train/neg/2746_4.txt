i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie as i didnt think it was going to be well done the kids ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it so i caved i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought but was still a far cry from the book the movie seemed right on with the 10 year olds understanding and sense of humor i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies dont show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices
