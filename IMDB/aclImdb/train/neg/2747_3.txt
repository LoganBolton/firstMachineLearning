i knew it would be but i gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that im pretty easy to please i really didnt think id end up feeling this negatively towards itbr br the plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can become one with a good dragon or something i dont know it was so stupid i didnt bother to put much effort into retaining itbr br it features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts so many of the events just felt totally random and suddenbr br i assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem i have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like its trying to be so grand and epic yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly i feel like ive just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball the film is like a punch in the face it doesnt take much time at all to establish characters or drama imagine the lord of the rings trilogy in 90 minutes you could have most of the epic battle sequences but there would be absolutely no buildup and youd hardly care about the outcome of those battles that was the case with dragon wars 90 minutes of me not giving a crap waiting for it to be overbr br fantastic cgi with some okay directing but horrible acting speedy pacing and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds i probably would have loved it when i was 6
