i hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity hyungrae shim is lucky that bad filmmaking isnt a capital crime or hed be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster im amazed that this film had a 75m budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that shim will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of filmgoers time i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by nowbr br with the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this budget as usual the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story transformers was another visual feast with a weak script but this makes it look like citizen kane
