this is the sorriest collection of clich√©s strung together on a straight line with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting ive seen in a long time canibalising scenes from star wars reign of fire godzilla lord of the rings and harry potter it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence was this movie good it wasnt a movie at allbr br even if it doesnt go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy the movie does offer some laughs the trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films gandalf can be funny talking korean the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between sauron and jajabing or whatever his name wasbr br bottom line any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers not on the directorwriter shame on you shim
