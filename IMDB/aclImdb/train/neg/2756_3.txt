rant start i didnt want to believe them at first but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie gwoemul aka the host of 2006 which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a bmovie genre successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets mainly spent on special effects have become more and more fantastic do south korean moviemakers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry has built up since the 1999 breakout film shiriswiri by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did rant endbr br the only reason i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean east asianstyled dragon i have seen to date for the final scenes now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 dragonheart the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons remember dungeons  dragons in 2000 hasnt anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use but how well you use it i hope there are more and better korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this onebr br in short i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem arirang being played at the very end as a creature feature i would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it but ive seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons
