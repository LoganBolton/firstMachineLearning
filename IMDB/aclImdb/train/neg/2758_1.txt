im giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in imdb rating system this movie was horrible it was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable i doubt even the salvation army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film i wont even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isnt good enough for plot spoilers to write comments on the plot would be pointless if i were to compare this movie id have to compare it to reign of fire however although i didnt like reign of fire either that movie at least was better than this one br br some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done the only reason i didnt was because i simply didnt think to do it i was hoping for a feast of cgi and fighting masterfully done but that isnt what happened the martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flashback scene very disappointing the cgi was not done well either one scene comes to mind during one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away atnothing someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys im also thinking the bad guys voice was dubbed by the voiceover of imotep from the mummy movies had that same scraggly echoing thing going on someone owed some royalties here since i mentioned the fight scene ill say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the purists i supposebr br dont go see it dont buy the dvd when it comes out either you have been warned
