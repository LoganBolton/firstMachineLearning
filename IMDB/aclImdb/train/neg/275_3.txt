it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy it is not only oppressively preachy but absurd stagebound dramatically straightjacketed and painfully overwrought watching it one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write i will not become a fascist on the blackboard 100 timesbr br now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2 and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about which anyone would wholeheartedly applaud and im sure it accurately captured the mood of the day but it is presented in such an immature overobvious sledgehammer way it fails abysmally as a work of artbr br the only good performances here are from paul lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic antifascist and lucile watson as the amusingly illmannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships the children are ridiculously shown as robotically wellbehaved little snips they do not even remotely resemble real human beings and bette davis a great actress here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen her every word her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for that she mustve been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayalbr br so yes this is a very important film just not a very good one
