i knew it wasnt gunna work out between me and dwars from the moment we met first its title was lazy d war like writing out dragon was too much for them also you really cant be that blatant with your title unless your blue monkey blue monkey can do whatever the hell it wants br br the second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the storys insane progression heres the film dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows old shop keep reveals several terrible truths that bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god tells the kid that hes a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in la is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness hes a 500 year old asian br br fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose why continue on dear reader if you have the ballsbr br so sarah the reincarnated lover has her own flashbacks i have the benefit of having an asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing its a korean legend and shes reincarnated from a korean princess but everything is in chinese later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt she calls the police cause it looks like shes having a heart attack see in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her shes locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims shes crazy i have a new phobia now and its that if im ever in trouble the first responders will just assume im crazy br br i have another point of contention with my harsh mistress dwar there is a scene when patrick dempsey jr dreamy reporter is in a caf√© with sassy black friend in the scenes prior miffed near divinity bauraki has killed an elephant slithered through a suburb and killed one of sarahs friends see people were afraid to come out after 911 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for business as usual no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on if i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win br br after being given a satisfying dragon on helicopter battle my cruel lover dwar treats me to a pi and vinegar filled scene to end it all with bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under la i guess they dont really say but dreamy reporter and sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up yep dragon palace some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestlemake love whatever and im not kidding good snake out of nowhere maybe you think im blowing it out of proportion im not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly there few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god sets baurki on fire sarah turns into a ghost and goes with dragongod dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits thank godbr br now our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times there was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars ill call him tuskan shredder he could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful he could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasnt helpful he could go in your dreams when that wouldnt do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered he was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry i like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises br br the actors for the most part were great if great somehow meant terrible jason behr whom i thought was awesome in roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and thats pretentious spacey and patrick dempseyishbr br the one thing i love about this filthy prostitute dwars is its lead actor bauraki that giant snake acted his heart out id dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demigod of evil then john barrymore was at playing richard the iii or hamlet there was emotion in every scene stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast when he ate an elephant i felt like no one past present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling he was more then an actor he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project yes damn it my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake ive got the balls to admit that do youbr br heres to hoping bauraki gets more work and isnt type cast that jason behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare and that i never have to watch blue monkey again br br so dwar its over i want my cds back and lets just be friends
