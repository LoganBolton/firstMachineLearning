everyone does things that they later regret things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession things that although seem rational at the time later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupiditybr br for some people it is signing the note for the new hummer for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cashbr br for me it was a filmbr br dwar dragon wars in hindsight i should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title but with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby i really wanted this film to work sadly by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory fifteen minutes into the picture i had the sudden sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film and worse i knew just how badly every point would all suckbr br let me be perfectly clear here the english language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really isbr br as for knowing all the twists of movie i was wrong in the spirit of the old godzilla films whose scales this one is not worthy to fill it conveniently sprouted extra subplots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialoguebr br it was infested with close calls miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angstbr br this film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the mighty morphing power rangers access to the national defense budget and lots of liquorbr br let me try to explainbr br imagine you could get a hold of all the coolestlooking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade first take the rastatalking army of amphibians from star wars episode one and remove their prozac until they are ready to club navy sealsbr br next take close approximations of kira knightly and tom cruise you can even call him ethan as a subtle nod to the mission impossible franchise and give them lots of film noir narration so no one get confused while trying to follow the wadingpool depths of their thoughtsbr br finally add a raspyvoiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a lord of the rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of king kong and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day los angelesbr br now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine when you return puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semigelatinousbr br at several points during this picture i found myself saying out loud make the bad movie stop and breaking into tearsbr br to call this a bmovie would be giving it an undeserved promotion after summer school and a lot of physical therapy it might possibly pass for a c level film if you could somehow sleep through most of itbr br in short if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and the need to punish yourself for hideous unspoken sins against humanity dragon wars might just be the film for you
