theres no one else watching the movie my husband and i went to watch it last night its just a small theater but theres usually a decent amount of people there not this time my husband and i were the only people watching dragon wars last night now we know whybr br the movie was by far one of the worst ive ever seen yes the cg was good but that was it the acting script  dialog directing editing etc was godawful since we were alone in the room we felt free to talk during the movie that is we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of the mighty morphin power rangers godzilla mortal combat and the lord of the rings it was like we expected to see rita and lord zed portraying commanders of saurons armybr br the creatures were ridiculous you cant just introduce legions of dinodragonlizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation the lord of the rings has a wide spectrum of characters but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies not in an hour and a halfbr br the scene transitions are horrible i didnt fall asleep during the movie but even though it was an overly simple plot i found myself getting lost in the plot holesbr br the characters were caucasian americans but spoke almost with broken english because of the badly written dialog in the scriptbr br the final scene that could have redeemed some value of the moviefailed ethan didnt cry when sarah diedthough he hadnt known her for very long during this life anyways he didnt seem too upset to be left in mordor not knowing where he was or how to get back we couldnt for the love of god figure out where he was or how he got there either but if he wasnt upset we shouldnt be eitherbr br oh and why did the dress that sarahs spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from queen elizabeth one more thingall 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife jack does this as well then why does ethan get screwed hes left alone without the girl without a mapcompasshelicopter to help him get back whats he supposed to do send smoke signals and if he gets back home does he just go back to his job he should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes hadbr br dont waste your time or money on this movie we only stayed til the end because wed paid for it but as soon as the credits hit we were out the door
