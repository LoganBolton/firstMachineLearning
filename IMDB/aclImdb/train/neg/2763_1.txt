i went in to see dwar on a whim and with very low expectations the movie failed to meet thembr br i dont mind stories that stretch credulity  remember reign of fire  but i do expect them to be internally consistent this film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of lotr or even godzillabr br a shapeshifting mystic warrior from korea curiously metamorphosed into a caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess a special agent from the fbi who seems to be completely boned up on ancient korean folklore because of the feds excellent paranormal division  which has gone unremarked up to this point lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims i never meant for this to happen a reincarnated pair of long dead koreans who died like starcrossed lovers mystic pendants faceless hordes of robotic soldiers that owe a lot to peter jacksons orcs and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract itbr br the dialogue is appalling the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was to be honest tedious however for me the crowning moment was at the end after the finale when the music for the closing credits was  arirang this is rather like akira kurosawa closing ran with a karaoke rendition of my way  and let me be clear that i am in no way comparing director shim to kurosawabr br in short a self indulgent lackluster collection of clich√©s and narrative nonsequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer  or even a not soserious movie goer i would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video but im not even sure that its worth that much
