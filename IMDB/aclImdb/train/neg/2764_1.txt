first off i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen its not even the low budget scifi channel movie its just awful me and my friend who love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons mindless entertainment all we got was a mindless hour and a half the cg was not as bad as i was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 yearssounds like a good remake of rain of fire no the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and a very small actual war between dragonsrather big snakes it just gets ridiculous the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laughed through the whole thingalong with all 5 of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest ive seen a lot of b movies like reptilian the cave spider and others but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour watch thisbr br story 110 cg 510 acting310br br i dont drinkbut it would have helped before watching this movie
