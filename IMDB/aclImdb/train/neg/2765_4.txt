how this movie got made with a supposedly 70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me the storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before no one seems to be grounded in the real world the acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dudbut several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down the heros hair probably shouldve gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbingnot to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic finally for a movie about la being besieged by giant reptiles this film is shockingly boring what a shame if you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken the sfx scenes and built a far better movie around them sadly it wouldnt have taken much
