this movie was horriblebr br they didnt develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly it was a definite sleeper youd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but dwars surprises you with even a let down in that department br br also the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick and i seriously mean thatbr br i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad please whatever you do people dont waste your time and money on a crappy movie like dwars
