this movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie face it you cant because that way theres nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot have meaningless transitions trite unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turdbr br i wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie really i did i like lots of crappy movies but once ive been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and why dear lord why more than a few times i really cant take it any morebr br also i would love for someone to explain how la became mordor for the last scene
