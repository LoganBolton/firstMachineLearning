this was the worst acted movie ive ever seen in my life no really im not kidding all the based on a true storyhistorical references aside theres no excuse for such bad acting its a shame because as others have posted the sets  costumes were greatbr br the sound track was typical asianstyle music although i couldnt figure out where the modern love song came in when fernando was lying in his bed thinking of maria i dont know who wrote  sang that beautiful song but it was as if suddenly norah jones was transported to the 1500sbr br the hershey syrup blood in phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the kwiknez battle scenesbr br but the acting oh so painfully sad lines delivered like a bad junior high play if gary stretch had donned a potato costume for the county 4h fair he may have been more believable towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug at times i half expected him to yell out adrian or even you wanna piece of mebr br favourite line when the queen says to her lover after barfing on the floor im going to have a baby he responds a child i expected her to retort no jackass a chair leg duh
