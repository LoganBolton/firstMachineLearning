this movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera sound film sets music costumes  but drumroll gary stretch spoke i dont know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script but would say it was both considering the casting of him in this role i found it difficult to root for him even to the very end i wished hed have died in battle or one of the swordknife scufflesbr br then the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didnt have dinner and sex with his queen pretty lame and to go to the extreme to kill her own son and to then push up her lover as succeeding king i see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes but the manner in which this was all presented was farcicalbr br i dont recognize gary stretch from anything else but he was dreadful i read another users comments about audio being dubbed but dont think his was dubbed  after all he speaks english right it really was awful the lines were read right off the coroners table  flatline it could be he just doesnt have the voice to carry tone fluctuationsbr br aside from this i did watch it to the end so the movie had at least an interest it could have been more if the scriptlines and casting had been given more work the scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else the cast and story were all secondary i give the film crew a 10
