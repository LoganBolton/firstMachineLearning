my husband and i are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie we were very upset that the jcc is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out we demanded out money back we would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the jccs achad program to apologizebr br we did not like seeing frankie  a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager  as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nannys breastsbr br there was no point to frankies character other than to say hey being mentally disabled is funny challenges like frankies are a serious matter families like mine are truly sufferingbr br the screenwriter needs to explain herself does she know families with disabled kids does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the jcc pool
