i know that some films i mean european films that are very bad films are being regarded as great cinema by certain critics only because theyre nonamerican i saw the 81 imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals dont let this fool you unless youre one of those people that likes mindnumbing films like this and call it great art afterwards skip it the film contains one hilarious scene after another a similar italian film popped into my mind the terrible preferisco il rumore del mare i prefer the sound of the sea the problem with these films is that theyre not only boring like some other strangely praised films but that they almost play like camp i mean lets face it the acting is horrible i mean soap operalevel the story has not one surprise this has been done endless times before connecting several storylines short cuts magnolia playing by heart only much better not one realistic character in it some true freakseeing along the way notice the hilarious zombielike daughter and so on and so onbr br as if thats not enough the film is 135 min count it long and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence well this is an insult to cinema and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in another language in this case spanish strange world we live in310
