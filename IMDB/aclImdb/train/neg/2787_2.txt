by the numbers story of the kid prince a singer on his way to becoming a star then he falls in love with apollonia appolonia kotero but he has to deal with his wifebeating father clarence williams iii and his own selfdestructive behaviorbr br i saw this in a theatre in 1984 i was no big fan of prince but i did like the three big songs from this moviepurple rain lets get crazy and when doves cry the concert scenes in this movie are greatfull of energy and excitement unfortunately thats a very small portion of the moviebr br the story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times beforeand much better too the subplots are to put in nicely badly handled the love triangle between the kid appolonia and morris day was so predictable and tired that i actually became insulted his wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled in acting and direction that i couldnt believe it the script is terriblelousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines and theres tons of misogyny herethe kids mother getting beaten the kid hitting appolonia and for no reason appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river also williams and princes characters treat women in a horrible manner constantlybr br the acting is where this movie really fails appolonia is sweet and beautifulbut no actor and prince is easily the worst actor ive ever seen his blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad i couldnt believe it this movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there arent really that many the dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through they should have just made this a concert film i give this a 2only for the music
