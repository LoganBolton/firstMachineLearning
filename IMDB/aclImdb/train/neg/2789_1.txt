savage island 2003 is a lame movie its more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting not only that the storyline and script was wretched i dont know why this movie was made i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood boil the situations were inane at best if i made a movie like this it would have been a short really because those backwood idjits wouldnt have been in the picturebr br dont be fooled by the cover on the dvd i am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable i dont mind movies being shot on dv but if youre going to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired retread of superior horror films sans wrong turnbr br i have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pass on bybr br movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1
