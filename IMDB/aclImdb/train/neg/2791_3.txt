as with most of the reviewers i saw this on starz ondemand after watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched i on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean the design of dr meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title after watching it i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story its best to pass over this onebr br major spoilers ahead after making their first video for their asyetunfinished cd the lead singer cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her 3 months later the band is trying to decide if theyre going to finish the album or not to try and see what cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers dr meso and try to contact her through him in his card reading dr meso turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members bad times are ahead i just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the death card really just represents change kudos to them on that at least even without the approval of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album but while in the bathroom cassidys bestfriend dora catches a glimpse of her deceased friend when another bandmate goes in to check on her dora is standing in the dark requesting his sunglasses thats when the killing beginsbr br my main problem with the film from the very getgo is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault too many warping effects unnecessary zooms and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film an incoherent storyline doesnt help anything either while the narrative hangs together for the first part once cassidy is resurrected everything falls apart we have jumpcuts between cassidy and dr meso who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building which show they are connected in some way or another however within a few minutes of that revelation we find that cassidy really is an independent being from meso she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker but not in a good waybr br from this point on the whereabouts of cassidy are shown but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next shes nowhere to be found as he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a hallway then in another room grabbing the keys which neil already has then back again not to mention that from one moment to the next cassidys mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it one moment she wants to kill everyone although shes only wounded 90 of the characters  the next shes apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again sound confusing thats because it is its a jumbled mess that im sure the writer couldnt even figure outbr br as for the performances most are particularly wooden some though are interesting but overall this isnt a piece that would be known for its acting the story is the driving force behind this piece
