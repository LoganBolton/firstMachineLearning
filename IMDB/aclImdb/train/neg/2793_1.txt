this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies ive seen so far on starz on demand they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crapfest they can find and put it on herebr br why who knows apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv to be honest this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailerbut i did give it a real chancebr br i always try to have an open mind about lowbudget movies some of the best movies ive ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be greatbr br this is not one of those moviesbr br you know the plot by now im sure if youre reading this either you heard about it on starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom its about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal music video whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting but it really really doesnt anyway she kills herself then she possesses someone then some killing starts its really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible when the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping was that the best sound effect they could come up with i could find a better sound effect to use for free with no copyright on the internet right nowbr br dont let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you they are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buyingbr br laughable
