well because im a musician i thought maybe ill check this movie out on tmc nothing else good on one of the worst mistakes of my life so far and its only half done i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting crappy filming and crappy effects but nope i dont even get the pleasure of that even the musicians werent very good i was hoping for maybe some laughs but i wasnt sure if they were attempting to throw in oneliners or not but now i have to sit here and watch the rest just until pulp fiction starts or maybe something better and now i get to sit here typing until i have 10 lines
