for the most part on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen and already have an opinion on it was either this or invinicible i like mark wahlberg movies which i havent seen and i was actually in a movie watching mood which doesnt happen often anymore because ive already watched all the movies i own a million times and thats a lot of movies and i dont have much interest in new movies and boy this movie made me regret it im not going to put in any spoilers im just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half way decent i think the main girl the dead one who kills everyone is very annoying looking but convincing id take her for psycho bitch anyday so she fits her roll well though it is lame the blood isnt that great only a few of the kills or may i say woundings are alright but you dont see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off and being a band member the recording parts werent very interesting either though what happened would truly happen when going about recording im done if you want to watch this suit yourself
