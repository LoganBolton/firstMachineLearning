whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all not even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did notbr br even at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there werent a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very slowlybr br this movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i cant give a 0
