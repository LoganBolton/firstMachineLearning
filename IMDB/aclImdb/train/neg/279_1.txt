wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real lowbudget setting dont miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a nobrain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhoodbr br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shootouts 45 secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbodys attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and thenbr br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thoughtout by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenesbr br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesnt deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money
