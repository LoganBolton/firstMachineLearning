considering the limits of this film the entire movie in one setting  a music studio  only about 5 or 6 actors total it should have been much better made if you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad and the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance well it tried to but really failsbr br it makes attempt to be selfreferencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad and the main character neal guy what a pathetic looser clearly like 10 people total made this film and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around this was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pregrunge erabr br thankfully i didnt pay to see this starz on demand delivers again but it was under the title the possessed not studio 666 it doesnt matter what you do to the title it cant help this this could have been a much better made movie  there is no excuse for this bad filmmaking when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough and that music video wow that was bad i fast fowarded through thatbr br so 210 is fair if you are into the whole bmovie crap i suppose youll go and see this
