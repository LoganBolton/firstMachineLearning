the worst kind of film basically the us declaration of independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museums security for several days ehbr br the plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current which it wouldntbr br it would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter but that system wouldnt fit into the case sorry to be anal but this isnt even close to being plausible the rest of the film wasnt a great deal better and im left wondering why the budget couldnt have been donated to charity or me
