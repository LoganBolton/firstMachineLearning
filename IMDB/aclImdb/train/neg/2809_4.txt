when i look back on my college days at ohio university there will always be one event in which i will remember with fond memories channel 23 is ous local access channel and until the last few years pretty much played anything they were sent this included many diy movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow peeps and then scanning pictures of them online to a version of macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibsbr br however the king in my opinion of the channel 23 lineup was midnight skater the first time i watched it was around 2am i should have been studying or sleeping or watching regular tv but no all that is for pussies my roommate and i watched midnight skater and when it was complete i dont think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened but sure enough it was on a few nights later and we had to come to grips that this movie did in fact existbr br i could go on and on about how awful it is but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living the plot is disjointed the acting terrible the everything soul scarring but by god if there are others watching with you its impossible not to have a good time watching it its sort of like the first time you hear guts by chuck pahalniuk you hear it youre disgusted and shaken but five minutes later all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just enduredbr br long story short midnight skater for all of its epic flaws makes for some very late night fun plus i desperately want the theme to midnight skater kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it sweet god i love that song
