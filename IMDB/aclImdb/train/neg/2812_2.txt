i saw this film recently in a film festival its the romance of an exalcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middleaged woman who works in an employment office inem i found the story very simple and full of clich√©s taking the social theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy the lead actor did a good job he definitely looks like an alcoholic man but ana belen is not believable as a working class woman she looks acts and talks very much like a highstanding woman what i mean is that ana belen plays herself she does it in all her movies anyway the whole miseenscene of the film was very poor the photography is ugly not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio the dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times the comic situations are typical from gomez pereira but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly in my opinion this film is not worth watching only if you really love pereiras previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit anyway i walked out of the theater because i felt i was wasting my time the filmmaker was by the door i wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films specially one that is made to please everybody
