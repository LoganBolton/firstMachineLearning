1st watched 8262001  3 out of 10dirtobe hooper scary yet sadisticwhich makes sense portrayal of a relative of the marquis de sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did this tobe hooper film really doesnt do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star freddy himself  robert englund playing a dual rolethe marquis de sade and his relative it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with hoopers name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore its obvious this didnt work
