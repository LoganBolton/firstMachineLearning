well tivo recorded this because of angelina jolie it had 25 stars it seemed promising it went downhill fastbr br there is much overacting even from angelina shes about 20 and playing a 16 year old there are three characters that are supposed to be italian everyone else is italian american the native italian accents were good i thought the young male lead is cute my wife says everyone else in this movie is a fat italian woman even the menbr br i should have known that when dick van patten was cast as a randy doctor that that was a bad sign the two couples chasing their kids around are like the four italian stoogesbr br my wife would not let go of the remote hopefully she was not taking makeup clothing or decorating tips it was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish it was hidegarishousbr br cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie if this movie shows up on your tv do yourself a favor and ram your head through the tv screen instead youll be glad you did the only movie ive ever seen that was worse than this was hamburger the movie or maybe deadly friend
