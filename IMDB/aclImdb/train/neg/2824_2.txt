im a big porsche fan and the car was the best star in this filmbr br haim the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80s is bland as per usual and commenting on back up from minor charactersactors would be pointless needless to say they were all very average its a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80s  with some weird clothes some good shots of the colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plotbr br all in all please dont waste your time watching this unless you love 80s movies corey haim or like myself love old school porsches this one in particular looks great because lifes too short to watch crappy movies
