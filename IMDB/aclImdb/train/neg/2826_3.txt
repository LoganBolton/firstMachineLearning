i hope the viewer who regards dream machine as one of corey haims finest and the best movies of the century was kidding undetected sarcasm on my part i sincerely hope sobr br the dream machine marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of corey haims career except prayer of the rollerboys which was surprisingly decent here haim plays nonchalant college boy bernie who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girls attention lucky for bernie a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tunerberniewith a gift a slick porsche turbo however unbeknownst to the woman and unfortunate for bernie is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk now being that in this movie bodies dont seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk bernie is unaware of this in fact the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise in particular a grizzly man follows him around desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetectedbr br this is a lowgrade action fizzle as many of haims films like this are see the double o kid despite being part action part romantic comedy this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first fortyfive minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem ie bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body and a hitman finding out that the porsche is going to be hard to find after which and thanks to poor acting by haim i loved this kid too but its not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously couldnt act well and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result inappreciable to add injury to insult the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like selfevident songs you would hear in team america see the date montagebr br loyal corey haim fans however should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance however others understanding that haims career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered might expect mediocrity as will viewers just looking for early 90s bcomedy fluff to pass the time
