the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the late 20th century from west africa to the arab middle east the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard fleishers favorite enemies arabs and germans to make us believe that very arablooking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in roots obviously both trades arewere run by locals and involved much more sophisticated networks while arab countries are complicit in todays child and sex slave trade israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer its obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish directorbr br the acting is above average especially by peter ustinov suleiman and kabir bedi malik michael caine dr linderby is good as always
