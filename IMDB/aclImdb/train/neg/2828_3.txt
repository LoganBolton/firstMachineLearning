there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70s and the fact that i cannot recollect the title to a single one of them offhand is a measure of their impact these are what novelists would call potboilers they are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping moviestars in the public eyebr br we have micheal caine peter ustinov omar sharif rex harrison and william holden more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats every taste in hero is catered for though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointedbr br their talents are simply thrown away and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense this sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a cv sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way roundbr br it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset that ludicrously mismatched jauntyjazz theme music which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator muzak who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central africa or the endless sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop definitely a serious goofball ennio morricone would have known what to do and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points this director should have taken the trouble to watch lawrence of arabia or even sergio leones westerns he might have learnt a few things but then again probably he wouldntbr br alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film frantic it was later remade with equal panache staring harrison ford in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible here when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado rex harrison kept poppingup out of nowhere like some wily old genii to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled br br at least the photography was rather good with excellent use of the often beautiful environment but then the dumb music must pipeup and blow to atoms what little ambiance this createdbr br action scenes were also contrived and stilted with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a firstyear drama class and of course the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment  as you dobr br and thats about as much comment as this item deserves except to say that the script was pretty wretched as wellbr br stick with your hobby on this one even if it contained your favourite moviestars youre sure to be disappointed too
