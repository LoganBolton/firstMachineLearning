what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albabr br unfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepbr br the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itbr br azjazz
