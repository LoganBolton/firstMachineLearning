ive now watched all four bo derek vehicles directed by her husband john all are quite terrible of course but this is certainly the pits featuring the usual flimsy plot bad scripting  by the director naturally  and acting not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star it deals with her losing much older husband anthony quinn she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired hemingway but who continues to appear and talk to her in fact he wants to come back in another younger bodybut actually does so only in the very last scene derek is lovely as always and still playing naïve  especially during a muddled midsection which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa quinn too is typically largerthanlife read hammy here but this easily constitutes his nadir besides for much of the duration he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo his replacement then is obviously a handsomelooking stud who hasnt a lick of talent or even personality also featured in the cast are hollywood veterans don murray as quinns best friend and bos business consultant and julie newmar as quinns guardian angel in the afterlife  plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire donald trump who presumably needed this on his resume it also goes without saying that john derek was his own cinematographer on the film that the end credits are filled with useless and corny expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand and that ghosts cant do it swept the board at the 1990 razzie awards
