i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf and before i got my first vcr i figured id christen it with this little gem and its bad filmmaking at its finestbr br the dialog is inadvertently hilarious and it contains a cameo with donald trump anthony quinn is in it inexplicably and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years this movie is mr quinns country bearsbr br it features lines like shut up and let me fightbr br and youre saying a lot of shit br br and the priceless comeback unfortunately it is shit tough angry shitbr br youll be awed by a fight scene as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll chop socky action and t and a thrillsbr br what schlock movie fan could ask for more oh and when mr quinns character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness he says real men dont eat quichebr br uh aaa yeah if bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there
