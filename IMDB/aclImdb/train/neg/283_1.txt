to moviethis movie felt like one of those after school specialsonly lower budget and lower everything elsei guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sortbut it didnt work for meyet some how it comes across as preachyit has very pale shades of flash dancebut so whatthere just isnt any excitement in this moviethe dialogue is contrived and clichéd to deathof coursethe whole movie feels like a bad 80s clichéthe acting was less than stellarthough that has a lot to do with what the actors were givenor in this casenotto work withon top of that is the poor song choiceswith really bad lyricsi felt embarrassed for all the actors involvedthey are all talentedbut you cant tell from this moviethis is just my opinion of coursebut i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 110
