oh yes sakura killers is a goofy horrible ninja movie make no mistake but its also an incredibly enjoyable one this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck connors who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes i suppose hes supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type the tough ninjabuster the box copy exclaims but his wisdom is laughable move without thinking my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation not of supreme concentrationbr br but really his two aides sonny and dennis have such horrible dialogue that brooklyn as we call the colonel tends to shine in comparison especially watch for dennis logic regarding the genetic splicing the sakura are involved with if you know anything about cloning you will die laughing and yes this is a major plot point folksbr br a terribly fun movie sakura killers is a hardtofind gem i wont spoil the trick ending for you either except that its a perfect set up for a sakura killers 2 too bad chuck connors died  because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas
