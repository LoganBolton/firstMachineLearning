a comparison between this movie and the last detail is made by some but chasers is flatter than a stretch of interstate highway in west texas and like the scenery in the desert theres nothing much to distinguish it not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around no one in the cast comes off too well with this lame script thats not surprising dennis hopper the director wont give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir i dont think
