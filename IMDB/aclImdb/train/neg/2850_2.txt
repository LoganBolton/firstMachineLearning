if i had realized john wayne was in this movie i would not have watched it its demeaning to the japanese unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person but then most john wayne movies are like that hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was and still is somewhat different the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan maybe its hollywood that should be isolatedto put it as succinctly as possible this film is appalling jingoistic claptrapsort of a madama butterfly with bad music
