dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind but now hes fixed lane is his girl whos been messing around with his number one goldblum whos supposed to have something going with lanes sister barkinbr br with what anyone could consider an allstar supporting cast burt reynolds gabriel byrne kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor cant help this plot as dreyfuss proves hes not fixed and tries to kill just about everyone in sightbr br you know its not like you didnt know what was coming the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out but ill save you all the trouble skip this moviebr br the actual reason i picked this movie is because ive been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies the real letdown for me wasnt just the terrible plot but also the fact that she doesnt show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie although we hear about her all through the movie even being a fan of over half of the cast cant help me enjoy this film the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going onbr br 3 out of 10 stars
