mad dog timetrigger happy whatever you wanna call itsimply doesnt hit the mark maybe its just me maybe i just dont like gangster comedies  as i thought oscar  johney dangerously and mafia also sucked  its probably more witty sharp wordplay than all out comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it  or the other reviewers make it out to be br br the rick  mick  vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch br br there wasnt enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in the majority of the film was either set in dreyfuss club or a variety of offices dim rooms  what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning  br br the supporting cast was on paper excellent  great to see silva  dragobut characters were killed off before they had time to develop and richard pryors cameo was a joke  the romance and love element of the film also bogged it downbr br 410 i dont think ill return to it anytime soon
