ive seen plenty of scifi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 my first one was sabretooth  which actually is one of the more entertaining scifi channel features in my opinion their quality varies some of them are average but decent sabretooth dragon fighter never cry werewolf swamp devil some are laughably bad and then there are some that are truly terrible raptor planet lies in the latter br br raptor planet a loose sequel to the 2004 scifi channel original raptor island is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as cgi and stock footage from raptor planet are some of the worst looking effects ive seen in a low budget film the gore effects are even unconvincing br br the plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason i forget why travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs thats right folks the dinosaurs are aliens dinosaurs in outer space whats next sharks in space the rest of the plot is simple the human cast are picked off and eaten by now weve come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released but this is the first killer dinosaur movie ive seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacksbr br there are a few chuckles in it though theres one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a carnotaur brought to life by stock footage from the original film that seconds later becomes a giant raptor also a bit of trivia this is the scene where steven baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie br br while raptor island wasnt a good film to begin with its a masterpiece compared to its sequelbr br believe me when i say this is quite possibly the worst movie syfy has ever aired its darn near unwatchable
