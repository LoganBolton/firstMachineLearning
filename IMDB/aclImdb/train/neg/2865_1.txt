generally i dont do minuss and if this site could i would give this movie 3 out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie i thought uwe bolls alone in the dark was the worst ive seen yet but at least i gave it a 25 out of 10 in my opinionstephen dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne bloodrayne would win a oscar for best movie if they were competingbr br now to the plot this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but theyve could have done better the start looked ok but thats it i had to fast forward most of it because the deaths where boring i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths im not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this sorry for rambling but theres nothing good to say about it because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this this thing of disaster uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cakebr br well sorry i couldnt explain the plotif there was one but that was the best i could now if you dont mind im going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life ok not for life
