i was lying on my bed with a really bad cold or flu or whatever i figure maybe id kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago i wish i never picked this movie after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up afterwordswhen i got better of course i did some research on dennis lrader and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do dont eat or youll feel the way i felt after i first watched it i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus 3 at least that movie had better reviews on this site
