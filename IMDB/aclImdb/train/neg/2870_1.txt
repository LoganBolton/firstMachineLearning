oh my god please for the love of all that is holy do not watch this movie it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back sure i could have stopped watching half way through but i thought it might get better it didnt anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual no wonder us australiansnew zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing i dont even normally write reviews on here but in this case ill make an exception i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
