this is by far the worst horrorthriller ive seen in my 29 years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isnt even the worst part of this movieits the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killers capture but ive seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this
