this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured theres male full frontal nudity dead animal parts dogs licking nipples the female loosing control of her bladder all shot in a gray cold color effective but a little too much we then move on to seeing the btk killers youth as well as the present and his history of crimes the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and its creepy here we dont see fancy or good imagery it looks as if shot with your home camera it doesnt look horrifying but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling what this movie doesnt have is any drama really there are some cop scenes every once in a while but theres no excitement in terms of them finding the killer there isnt much of an arc to this story this could have been an effective psychological thriller a study of madness unfortunately the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage its dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again sometimes you dont know its coming and dont have enough time to look away and that i have to reject im all for low budget horror movies but i dont tolerate animal suffering it was unnecessary excessive and comes without warning im glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore stay away from this garbage
