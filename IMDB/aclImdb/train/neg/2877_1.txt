my mother worked with dennis l raider for eleven years not to mention shared an office with him when it was announced he was btk she was shocked the whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the wichita killer ive heard her retell them many times ive inquired her about a lot of things and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to ive read the entire book written about raider wichita is my hometown and i was surprised that such a thing could happen in kansasbr br there was another btk movie on tv not too long ago and i thought this one would have been better at portraying dennis killings maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motivesbr br im going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie this is based on my moms portrayal of him all my readings on him and the video tapes ive seen of him talkingbr br first of all the camera angles were horrible it looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera the acting was terrible and i couldnt even bear to watch itbr br dennis raider never had long hair dennis raider was a very anal man and was a follow the rule book kind of guy he wasnt as nice as the movie made him look he was very polite and abrupt business like same goes for his killings as far as we all know if youve seen his confession in court you can already guessbr br and as for the obsession with the slaughter house no never have i read or has dennis raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs in fact he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods yet throughout the whole movie he was putting animals in his victims faces and acting like he cared about the wellbeing of thembr br dennis raider never killed the people that he knew he confessed this but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her alsobr br i really dont even want to go in to this movie and im already ranting this is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of btk this is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie if you want a badly shot halfporno with some slaughter scenes served the side then this is your kind of movie
