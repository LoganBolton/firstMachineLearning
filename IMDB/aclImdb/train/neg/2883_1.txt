this movie is just so awful so bad that i cant bear to expend anything other than just a few words avoid this movie at all costs it is terriblebr br none of the details of the crimes are reenacted correctly lots of slaughterhouse footage weird cuts and edits no continuity to the plot the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seenbr br this bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of its content the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky it looks as if it was shot on videobr br in fact now that theyve got dennis rader with life in prison i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as wellbr br seriously dont even think about watching this one id give it a negative star if i could
