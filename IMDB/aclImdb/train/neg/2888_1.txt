to compare this squalor with an old low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old low budget porno flick the animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part Â…gripping retelling of the btk killers reign of terror this is not a retelling a retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why none of these things are true im an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly this is not one of them this isnt even about the btk killer save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent dahmer instead that serial killer movie is accurate and true however if you just have to see this movie for yourself check it out for free at your local library and even then youll still feel cheated
