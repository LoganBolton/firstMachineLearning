the past creeps up on a rehabaddict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox lifes dramas presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable not even the writing has any bite or wit the cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another and the music and photography are lugubrious a couple of the visual effects are laughable indieclich√© touches that reek of a puny budget although written and directed by a man this was produced by a woman and im not sure but i think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men estranged brothers growing closer never quite gels never feels natural or seems lived in its an attempt to get inside a male relationship but the careful sterile presentation is a cheat no ones heart is in this living breathing or bleeding this material the perfect son is quickly diffused by too many cooks in the kitchen
