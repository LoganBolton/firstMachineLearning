im starting to write this review during a break as i watch the movie its the first time ive tried doing that but im having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks thats not because its intense but because its badbr br its almost painfully tedious and unbelievable especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother ryan colm feore is on screen being tragic and bitchy selfindulgent and selfpitying this would have been a much better movie if theyd just left that character out of the storybr br he adds nothing but mawkish maudlin very irritating melodrama maybe somebody decided that if they couldnt make ryan believable theyd just make him obnoxious the problem with that is who cares if a spoiled whining obnoxious jerk is dying not mebr br the only thing this character has going for him is the fact that hes dying and sorry but thats just not enough dying doesnt make anybody special were all dying sooner or later it doesnt give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerkbr br the other two characters and the actors playing them david cubitt as theo and chandra west as sarah are very much more interesting and their story without ryans selfpitying interruptions would have made a much better movie but its not over yet and its time to hit play again maybe something great happens before the endbr br nope sorry this rented turkey goes back tonight
