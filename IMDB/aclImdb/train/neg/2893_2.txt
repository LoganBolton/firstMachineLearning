what was this supposed to be a remake of fisher king why do we care about sandlers character what a slow dreary boring whogivesadamnaboutthesepeople movie just simply painful to sit through i turned it off before it was over its so obvious that cheadle needs help as much as sandler like i said can you say fisher king and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life we arent supposed to think that deeply i guess why does cheadle continue to give sandler a chance to turn violent on him if they were such good friends how did they grow apart if cheadle is so in control why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street we are never told thats why fisher king was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks nearly 8 out of 10 average score i dont agree at all even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesnt deserve to be in the same universe with them
