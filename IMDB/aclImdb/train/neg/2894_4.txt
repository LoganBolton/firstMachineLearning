i admit the problem i have with the muchcelebrated ealing films ive seen so far could be mine to my taste either they are black and rippingly funny or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories thats a selfimportant way of saying i wanted to like the man in the white suit but found myself struggling to sit through its short run timebr br textile worker sidney stratton alec guinness may be meek in manner but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that cant be broken or made dirty using a factory lab for his latest experiment he toils against limitations both material and human  the latter being the benighted mill bosses who dont understand what he is up to then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping himbr br its small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress sidney complains practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the manbr br one problem with man in the white suit is that sidneys vision of progress is awfully smallminded too more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work my problem is more elemental for a comedy white suit is not funny its a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spittakes doubletakes tripletakes and dizzy takesbr br the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney toils at going bleepblopbleepbop endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film its leaned on too longbr br ive never seen guinness less affecting in a movie even though he looks impossibly young and earnest though actually in his mid30s he seems so bloodless even more so than the waxfaced general he played in doctor zhivago hes the same cold fish whether hes ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job panfaced vida hope as bertha or the more sultry charms of young daphne birnley joan greenwood his one real ally in his fight against shabbiness and dirt as she puts it making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only greenwood couldbr br supporting players make white suit work as well as it does ernest thesinger of bride of frankenstein fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle howard marioncrawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in lawrence of arabia then theres the undeniable charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone elsebr br but most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldnt think director alexander mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before his previous ealing comedy whisky galore doesnt reverse that impression alas roger macdougalls play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lightsbr br ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy yet the ealings ive seen never seem to do this working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers mackendrick again go figure are classics this way white suit on the other hand is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere just like that unfortunate suit
