the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box a textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesnt degrade but the movie fails to get on with it instead it pads for 45 minutes noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery since audiences dont benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out its a strange choice the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic once the fabric is discovered the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs and bluecollar coworkers want the invention squelched leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements inventing the chemical and running from oppressorsbr br i cant understand why anyone would describe this as comedy the tone isnt funny or comical its more like serious social criticism of the day that capitalism warps both supply chains and production which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world yes thats probably true but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact the movie is simply an earnest argument youll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any herebr br this is more like a british meet john doe meet nigel doe
