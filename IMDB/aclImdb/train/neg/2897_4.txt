theres little to get excited about dan in real life first off the whole setup is incredibly contrived did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant marie wouldnt have told dan where she was going and since dan did all the talking during that conversation why would she be so attracted to him for that matter i never figured out why marie was so attracted to dan throughout the movie hes very narcissistic and does little to convince us that hes truly a good guy for example he lies to marie in the bookstore ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make marie jealous with a blind date theres more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where dan and marie are caught making out by the whole family yeah like that could really happen dan in real life is slowpaced sappy and manipulative even chick flicks like the jane austen book club get higher marks than this predictable tearjerker
