wowwwwww about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured id give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better or at least have some redeeming qualities like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie or like really intelligent or very well filmed or somethingneedless to say that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this may contain spoilersimdb you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratingsall the ratings with about 710 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie im still a big imdb fan but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3
