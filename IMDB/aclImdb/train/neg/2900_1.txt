i have a 5 minute rule sometimes ill leave leway for 10 if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes its probably not going to ever get better i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory dan in real life is definitely no exception i was watching this turkey and thought wow this is not funny not touching not sad and i dont like any of the characters at allbr br the story of an advice columnistwidower raising three young daughters who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend i suppose the tagline would be advice columnist who could use advice i dont know dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice i guess thats the irony i dont know he goes to see his parents brothers sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat which seems very sweet and potential fodder for good comedy story linesnone which ever emerge the central story is basically how he loves this woman but cant have her anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny trite lifetime movie network dialogue murderer of love to get to the inevitable happy endingbr br this is truly one of the worst movies ive ever seen
