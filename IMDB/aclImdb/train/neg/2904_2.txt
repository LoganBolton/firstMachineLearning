if in the first 10 minutes of this film you dont realize that the main character who writes a life advice column is going to have the tablesohsocleverlyturned and learn some valuable life lessons himself then there is probably something wrong with you the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie even if the rest of the movie was good which it isnt br br theres almost no chemistry between the leads and steve carells stalkerish behavior is embarrassing not funny its hard to believe binoches character would have any interest in him then in the end its all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after isnt that great america
