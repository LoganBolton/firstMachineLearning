might contain spoilers but believe me this movie spoils itself from start to finishbr br i walked into this movie with high expectations it was my own fault i had put too much stock in steve carells record to date 40 year old virgin little miss sunshine the office and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 75 user rating before going to the movie its always been a very good predictor in the past but something is definitely off lately the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching blue steel in 1990br br this flick fumbled from start to finish the script was flunky material awful writing all around murderer of love love is an ability whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beautys writers trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard the entire flick was peppered with threes companyish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene or the pointlessconfusing aerobics scene or the awful laundry room scene right when you think something serious andor real is about to happen they toss in one of these terrible moments and it happens over and over and over againbr br and whats with carells character the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love lets face it their conversation sucked they both should have said their goodbyes after a few minutes pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie carells character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and unfunny i think the exact line was this one time when i was a kid thats it seriously but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses the actors themselves looked like they were in pain wondering why theyre being directed to do what theyre doingbr br back to the imdb thing you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movies promotional team off this site i know its impossible but its painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratingsreviews were either posted by 12 year olds or by flunkys hired by the studio check out the family stones rating if thats a mid 5 then this absolutely has got to be a 2 and thats pushing it
