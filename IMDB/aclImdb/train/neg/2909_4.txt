watching tom hanks as a hit man for the irish mob is a little like seeing jimmy stewart as a serial rapist it just doesnt work i had a really hard time accepting thisnot that i dont think tom cant act he can ive been following his career since mazes and monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me maybe because im such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboythe only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroachthe movie as a whole fails for methe additions jude law and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed i was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of bonnie and clyde mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones there are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images paul newman is as usual excellent and i really did enjoy the score but tom as the angel of death sullivan was completely flat
