killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor  you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes arent the same jokes are lame even the actors arent as funny because thats the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be  funnybr br so now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldnt have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy
