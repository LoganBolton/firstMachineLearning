the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks as mike sullivan he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional for him role hanks is usually the good guy in a movie  the one you like admire and root for sullivan was definitely not a good guy its true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble  his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son even so he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings so hanks took a role i wouldnt have expected him in and he pulled it off wellbr br hanks good performance aside though i certainly couldnt call this an enjoyable movie after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic it wasnt entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very sombre movie about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster  largely raised by rooney paul newman whos a sort of mob boss and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak isolated from his business after the older son witnesses a murder the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet gets the wrong son and the mother and leaves sullivan and his older son mike jr on the run it becomes a weird sort of fatherson bonding moviebr br although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story its really very dark throughout that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks performance the movie as a whole just didnt pull me in 410
