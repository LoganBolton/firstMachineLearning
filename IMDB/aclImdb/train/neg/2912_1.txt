meatball machine has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous awful and overexaggerated scifi horror films that i have ever came across it is about good against evil and a comingofage tale with the aim of to entertain with bloody sleazy and humorous context because of that the violence isnt particularly gruesome and it doesnt make you squirm but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely the performances by issei takahashi and toru tezuka is the worst i have seen if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called yudai yamaguchi this movie just have it all it is bad to the bone a must see for every bmovie freak simply an enjoying and rare gem
