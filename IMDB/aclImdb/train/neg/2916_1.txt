this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the plot and message are horrible there are too many mistakes in this movie that its impossible to keep up i dont even understand how this movie can get any nomination let alone 2 heres why 1 sam lee portrays a angryirrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad pros hes angry alright cons when it comes to the explanation scene he cannot convey the sadnessdisappointment he has in his father the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyesbr br 2 to connect the movie to the title there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer i understand that its supposed to be a metaphor or what not but its just sooo dumb 3 why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer what the heck is wrong with this movie when the killer started stabbing an officer shoot him hes already dead what the heck there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed but i do not know why he wasnt 4 during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt in the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt so how the heck in the next scene that shes lending all her weight on her left foot and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer wtf 5 the sounds in the movie are off syncbr br 6 i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight 7 this movie is just too violent without a purpose cops are beating ci to a pulp and then if they cooperate they give them marijuana and coke this is overall the worst movie i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life worst movie ever
