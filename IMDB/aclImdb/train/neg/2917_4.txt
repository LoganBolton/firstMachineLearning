as it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories similar to unleashed which was great dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their masters bidding the main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see in fact by the end you lose track of who youre supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decidebr br although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the halfway point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling and in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessarybr br on the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies  so those who arent familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywoods predictability should check it outbr br the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten maybe im the only one but it strained my eyesbr br the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting buildup gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy you realize that its not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky countrymusic montage about peace and serenitybr br throw in some grisly frombehind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way asians fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didnt match the film and you get the average bland asian thrillerbr br i just dont get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanusbr br 410
