after watching this film i was left with a two very annoyances about this film why did they make chens character this mcguyver hitman and lees character such an incompetent idiot chens characters background is that he was raised in an underground cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs this detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant not only is he uneducated he is starving this is not a reference to chens scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food one of which being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship si in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that chen is malnutritioned unmodernizedand has only thing going for him his dog brawling fighting style of some sort despite this situation chen manages to outshoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head whom was holding chens girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a 50 lb block of concrete plastered on the end of a metal pipe to the head of the police chief as he is getting shot in the chest by said chiefbr br now lees characterokay i get it hes depressed hes got some baggage but wow can he do anything right one moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again first scene he runs into chen and he manages to misses him from approx 15 ft multiple times toward the end of that scene lee watches chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds while holding a gun to chen face at a 10 ft distance even at the end of the movie lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once againbr br and my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with chens character and that he is just killing to survive that would be a lot easier if i didnt just watch chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and lee others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill overall chens character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride did i mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film my 3 stars go to some of the interesting directorcamera work who got in some nice shotsbr br bottomline one made for the nuthugging chen fans for me dog bite this dvd
