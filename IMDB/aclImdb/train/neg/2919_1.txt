geez as a gay man who lives in nyc i can gratefully say that i have never seen the underbelly of gay culture that is portrayed in this film  and i am glad of it was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great antigay backlash and i cannot say that i would blame them the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average trandgender american what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare the inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments antiwhite are blatant and unsettling  society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the films cast  the actions of these people are not acts of desperation but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of ones self
