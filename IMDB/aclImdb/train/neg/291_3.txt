film version of sandra bernhards onewoman offbroadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say shes scathingly honest and that may be true but shes also shrill with an unapologetic inyourface bravado that isnt wellsuited to a film in this genre she doesnt want to make niceand shes certainly not out to make friendsand thats always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard cowrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of sandras inhouse audiences looking completely boreda feeling many real viewers will most likely share 12 from
