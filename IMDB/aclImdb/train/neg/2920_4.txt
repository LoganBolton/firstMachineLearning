wow im shocked to learn that its a small world and that we are all interconnected what a waste of 88 minutes john dunne put it much better in one sentence no man is an island the acting wasnt bad the kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin i couldnt follow it and the only real hero in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid i dont know i just dont get it oh well
