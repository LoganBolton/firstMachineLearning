there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life shes always wanted after the worst life possible beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end it sounds weird but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made he cant hurt her because he loves her and shes the mother of his child i think the time frame makes it clear its his child and not his brothers but at the same he cant forgive her for all shes done sleeping with his brother which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way and then being part of his death in better hands this would have been a better movie but for something i caught on late night cable its not bad
