id really really wanted to see this movie and waited for months to get it through our blockbuster total access account when it showed up in our mailbox i threw it straight into the dvd playerbr br i was very sadly disappointed which in turn made me mad ill give any movie a chance even if i want to walk out of the theaterpress stop i watched it all the way through but didnt get anything from it but frustrationbr br the acting was very very good but that was about it nothing is explained while we understand that mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind were never given insight to his downfall while we understand that he and cedric break up again we dont see it happen or why it happened during an interview with mathieus doctor cedric reveals that hed cheated on him once but it was no big deal i expected to see this in flashbacks but nonothing we also gets the hints that cedric was the one to bring mat to the hospitalbut again we dont see itbr br i know some movies are a take it as it is basis but this movie honestly ticked me off when pierre cedrics ex shows up in the club and starts trouble we dont see hide nor hair of him until near the end and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that pierre was the ex his personality at the club and when mat finds him are entirely different i might even be wrong saying this it was that confusingbr br the film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed outofplace and confusing pace i can keep up with films like pi citizen kane and other films that have flashbacksflashforwards left and right but cu didnt capture and hold onto the style at the end of citizen kane you know whats going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries cu just leaves you hanging it has an air of pretension in its were not gonna tell you a damned thing figure it out for yourself presentation its like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missingbr br good acting like i said i liked the characters but the whole story was just too disappointing
