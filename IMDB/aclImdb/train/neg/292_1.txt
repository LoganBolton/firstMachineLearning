i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered throughbr br the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line just one scene that is even worth a chucklebr br she is a much better singer than i remember her to be but i didnt want to watch a lounge actbr br i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and dont view it objectively
