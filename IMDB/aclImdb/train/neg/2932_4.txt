not that hed care but im not one of simon peggs friends if i was theres a good chance wed fallout if he continued to make dross like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guynextdoor type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but its starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities hes rude and obnoxious and thinks hes funny when he frankly isnt when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though hes done nothing nice oh and because hes a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i cant see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and megan fox isnt stretched at all the one huge plus is miriam margolyes as peggs new york landlady  now if she had been on screen longer
