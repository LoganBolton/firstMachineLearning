by my koolaid drinkers remark i mean that these are such devoted fans of the man pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film giving this a 10 is akin to giving wally cox the award for mr universe or putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre when this film debuted i remember the savage reviews with headlines such as no giorgio and some said it was among the worst films ever made this is definitely overstating it as well while bad and far from a great work of art there was a lot to like about the film and the movies biggest deficit was not the acting of pavarotti nor his girthbr br believe it or not the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers who i believe were chimps it is rare to see a movie with such clich√©d dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight but even they arent the heart of the problem the problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a romance that consists of a horny married middleaged man and a seemingly desperate lady perhaps european audiences might be more forgiving of this but in the united states in 1982 or today such a romance seems sleazy and selfishespecially when pavarotti tells harrold that he loves his wife and this is just fun wow talk about romantic dialog sadly if they had just changed the script a little bit and made pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic hollywood films such as from all this and heaven too or the suspect where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her instead shes the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and leftas pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting harroldbr br sadly even the gorgeous music of pavarotti couldnt save this film towards the end of the film there are some amazing scenes in new york where the set is just incredible and pavarottis singing transcendent for that reason i think the movie at least deserves a 3 i really wanted to like the film more but it was a truly bad filmthough not quite as rotten as you might have heardbr br sadly from what i have read this film might be a case of art imitating life as pavarottis own life later had some parallels to this film though this isnt exactly the forum to discuss this in detail
