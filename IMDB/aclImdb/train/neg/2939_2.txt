as others have said no luciano is a more apt title or response to this movie title for entertainment the great opera singer should stick to singingnot that hes a terrible actor its just that this movie stinksbr br the first 25 minutes were fine  a nice family movie as it were  but after that its nothing but a boring soap operabr br appropriately playing a singer pavarotti as giorgio fini loses his voice a few times and the doctor pamela taylor kathryn harrold comes to the rescue the singer then falls for the doctor the doctor slowly falls for the singer the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goesbr br pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy its harrold that spoils things and after watching her here i am not surprised she didnt become a star br br there is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy good shots of san francisco and italy at least in the first half of the film i got bored and dont remember much about the second half of it
