i saw this movie when i was really little it is by far one of the strangest movies i have ever seen now normally i like weird movies but this was just a bit too muchbr br theres not much of a plot to the movie if anything it starts out like toy story where toys come to life and raggedy ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend babette from there craziness ensues theres the greedy the looneys a sea monster named gazooks and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes all of which just made the movie weirder also i cant help but feel that babette is annoying and a bit too whiny she definitely didnt help the moviebr br now even though i didnt like this movie there were a few cute parts i liked the camels song even though it was a song about being lonely it had a friendly feel to it then there was sir leonard while most of the looneys were just plain nuts sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest king koo koo was just a little dirtbag that made dr evil look like a serious villain also there was raggedy andys song no girls toy it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough but honestly even these things didnt make the movie any better but remember this is just my perspective br br while i personally wouldnt recommend this movie even i have to admit it does have its charming moments see it if youre interested but only if youre in the mood for something really out of the ordinary
