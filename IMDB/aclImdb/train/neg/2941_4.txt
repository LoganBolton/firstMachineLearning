i hadnt heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website which made me curious as a cartoonist and illustrator myself im an admirer of richard williamss work  i rate ziggys gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals  but it seems the man has his faults most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a supertalented individual like williams can go given the right circumstancesbr br raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a childrens cartoon it tries also to be a musical it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well  is it a freakout is it a mindblower is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination  until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations its beautifully animated for the most part though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention but even that doesnt count for much when youre confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the action herebr br there are a number of problems with the film but lets start with raggedy ann and andy themselves theyre the stars of the show yet they have no personalities actually we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy im no girls toy he sings and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner a little girl called marcella carries her upside down but thats all we get to find out about these dullasmud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after i use the word weirdness advisedly because some weird films can be hugely entertaining but this is just flatout strange the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable but theyre actually bizarre and disturbing the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this but even theyre relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll yes this is supposed to be a childrens film then theres the music none of which is memorable and all of which is sung by actors who cant sing and to add insult to injury theres a lot of singing in this film when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are about how theyll always have each other andyes we get the message this seems to go on forever but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film not for long though because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like its made from worn and faded denim and  bad enough that hes clearly a paranoid schizophrenic  he also starts hallucinating but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow the greedy a living breathing belching farting constantly eating pool of taffy is so trippy creepy and ultimately disturbing youll hardly believe what youre seeing  this is as close to a drugfree psychedelic experience as ive ever seen on film then after a long time spent with the greedy along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo whose throne resembles a urinal i cant believe im actually writing a capsule description of a real film here  i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that im not blogging about an overwhelmingly whackedout nightmare i had part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay  little nemo cartoons for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it probably all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it but there isnt these scenes are just strange and very very long surrealism only works when theres a strong idea behind it or takes place against some semblance of reality but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality take away this element and youre left with pure self indulgencebr br as the final scenes unravel even the animation begins to look less impressive the pirate ship ludicrously detailed jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production and theres a nonevent of an ending that simply suggests money ran out even at a meagre 86 minutes in length the film feels like a neverending ordeal and its understandable why it flopped on its original release animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly but he did and theres nothing anyone can do about it
