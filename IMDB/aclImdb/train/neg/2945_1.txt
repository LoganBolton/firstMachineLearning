i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldnt make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad  but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though its like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy  excruciatingly painfulbr br if you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriouslybr br if you see this movie in the bargin bin at smart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake
