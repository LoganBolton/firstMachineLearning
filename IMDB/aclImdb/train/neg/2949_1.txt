wow what would you do with 33m let me give you a choice you can either a shred it and flush it down the toilet or bmake a film based on the premise of whoopi goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like i didnt butt trumpet and blows raspberries on the basis that this is funny thats right you would choose the option that has more merit  flushing down the toiletbr br this has to be seen to be believed i cannot even find the words to describe how bad this film is it doesnt even fit into the so bad  its good category i actually have it on the television as i write  and whilst watching i felt the need to come onto imdb and register my disgustbr br considering jurassic park was made a couple of years before how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit wg should have simply walked and damn the consequences everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of moneybr br i have to stop writing  i am about to implode
