ever since i started visiting this site and voting for movies i have never given any movie a rating of 1 even the disturbing dance workout with barbie got a 2 there is a reason for thisbr br any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie i have to stop and ask myself the following question is this movie really as bad as the horrific soulsucking beast that is theodore rex and ive never been able to answer yesbr br i would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said hey lets remake blade runner with barney in the harrison ford role and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film furthermore i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadnt gone strait to video this is that rare monster a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults id ask what were they thinking but in this case it might actually be redundantbr br anyhow all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if youre one of the five or six rabid fans of howard the duck or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time or you want to really punish yourself
