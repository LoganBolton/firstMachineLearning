ignoring if possible the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking which seems to be mandatory in australian governmentfunded films the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance thats a far as it goes the rest is simply awful the plots overburdened with wow symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere a gross example is the giant peach float obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory it was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free but nevertheless irrelevant prop the peach is given a cursory unexplained washdown at one stage but thats where it endsbr br similarly the contrived black spot road sign where stephs parents were killed is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past but her escape to what shes had a pretty good deal where she was especially considering her visual disability and the unending loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardianbr br the guinness prize for corny melodrama however goes to the characterization of alan alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multinational  hiss hiss as a supervisor alan performs the boss villainous dirty work he implements redundancies until surprise surprise the whole plant is closed and alan himself is left as a pathetic unemployed failure no clich√©free zones here mate not only this but alan also loses the seductive steph from the most unlikely relationship youd encounter if you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic dont ask about detail whats the significance of the shaving cream on stephs seductive leg why doesnt the hotel where the couple makes love eventually twig that someones gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and among other pandemoniums the sheets are regularly soiled  quite spectacularly on one occasion summing this movie up in one word avoid avoid avoid
