my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldnt tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such i wouldnt be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script stacys the carrier of the baby mother is a riot she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window bobbys the father best friends name is dewey and is an obvious rip off of sean penns character in fast times at ridgemont high this movie is horrid simply because none of the characters are believable thank goodness its only made for tv limiting the publics chances of viewing it
