miraculously this is actually quite watchable i mean its bad its really bad but whereas the original was sobaditsruiningmylife bad this is sobaditsmildlyentertaining bad right thats enough faint praise production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the romerowannabe satire cant make its mind up which side of the ecology fence its mocking internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges virus incubation times fluctuating as the plot requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not gore is the draw obviously but the framework is so slapdash its annoying the dialogue sounds like its been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of romeros films its all topped off with a horrendous synth score absolute rubbish
