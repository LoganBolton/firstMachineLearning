gone with the wind is one of the most overrated movies in history it is a film loved by mothers grandmothers and shutins who go to the movies once every five years as a zombie movie it blows there isnt a shambling corpse in sight and its terribly light in the gore department zombie 3 on the other hand is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its bloodspilling  therefore it is better than gone with the wind it is also not overrated most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish it is however not boring rubbish after a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground the terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty concoction hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesheating zombie one of his first victims is a cleaning lady once shes bitten lucio fulcis brand of hell breaks loose as usual for a fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is riddled with plot holes and the gore is plentiful turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature it is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat still it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing definitely worth picking up if youre an undead completest or dont like gone with the wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time
