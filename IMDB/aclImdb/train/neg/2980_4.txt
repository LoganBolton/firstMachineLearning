in 1979 lucio fulci released his film zombi however due to the earlier import of george romeros dawn of the dead which had gone by that name for its italian release it was retitled to zombi 2 which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie continuing this theme the second zombi film which would have been called zombi 2 was then consequently titled zombi 3 in the uk the original zombi film that is zombi 2 was titled zombie flesh eaters to continue this theme the second zombi film zombi 3 was then titled zombie flesh eaters 2 for its uk release are you following all this so if zombie flesh eaters was fulcis dawn then is 2 his day of the dead while this is only a flippant observation this tale of military compounds helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblancebr br some of fulcis european direction compels in a film like this but the acting dubbing and expositionheavy script are absolutely horrendous its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext while theres an unintentionally hilarious birds homage combining this last element with mor 80s rock is not a good idea for some reason i couldnt stop thinking of time of the apes qv the whole time i was watching this this is obviously not a good thingbr br while theres nothing here to rival topless scubadiving shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter fulcis misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaners mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood his fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing both themes are combined when a womans face is ripped off first by one zombie then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant womans stomachbr br productionwise this is obviously a step up from zombi coming five years later nine years in worldwide release terms but without the originals lowkey charm it struggles while stefano mainettis music is inappropriate and uninspired fabio frizzis score was one of the best things about the 79 movie here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like bonnie tylers holding out for a hero in the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest and roger and kenny two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious were out of ammunition to a stalling gun is a particular standout but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves low key or not fulcis original had truly magnificent rotting zombies skull faces worms in eye sockets they really were something to behold by contrast this dull followup opts for the more traditional men with a bit of paint on their faces option br br the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal br br it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes the rest filmed by bruno mattei im fairly sure that even fulci would have balked at the ludicrous flying zombie head scene and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave unfortunately however its his name thats above the film title on releases so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through on that scale then its a major setback for him for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all that of being boring
