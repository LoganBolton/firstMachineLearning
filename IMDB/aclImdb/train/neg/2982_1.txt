zombie review 3br br spoilersbr br few films are actually so bad theyre good and zombi 3 is not just bad its wretchedly unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them allbr br more than that its a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency sense or reason however we cant blame fulci as it wasnt really directed by him but by bruno mattei who doesnt even have fulcis sense of style to help carry the film mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitudebr br so im ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3 it has no redeeming features  in a genre known for thin characters weak story and lack of film making skill zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so its even funnier than nightmare citybr br the action starts when the death 1 gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape who is the thief why did he steal it and why did the us military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3br br after hiding out at a hotel the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it sending death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in zombie birds who then attack people and turn them into zombie people if zombies are cannibals why dont the zombie birds just attack other birdsbr br then we meet our heroes a trio of horny gis and a coachload of girls theres a couple of other guys with them too but theyre not important  no one is important here youll be hard pressed to remember anyones face let alone their name or find a reason to care about them they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was buzzing with life now its buzzing with flies but theres no escape from the undeadbr br by this point youll either be completely sucked in or youll have turned the damned thing off the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldnt save it so its just as well they have some of the worst  and not just the human characters the zombie acting here is an all time low theres no consistancy in how the zombies behave  some shamble about in the time honored style others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film its horrifying twist ending they die from gunshots to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good lefthook how can you punch out a zombie in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of vbr br the zombies also spend a lot of time hiding seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life they hide in bushes in garages in huts on roofs in the water and even underneath pregnant women at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs to kill and eat her no to push her into the water those zombies and their wacky sense of humourbr br there is plenty of gore though limbs are hacked wounds ooze green pus and theres much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in theres nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing but if bad make up effects are your bag you wont be let downbr br all this and ive not even mentioned the awful music the inexplicable flying zombie head the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad or the final chilling punchline in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj hes gone over to their side our escaping heros cry before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never camebr br zombi 3 is rubbish  it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of its existence erased yet somehow i feel my life is richer for having seen itbr br did i say richer i meant 88 minutes shorter
