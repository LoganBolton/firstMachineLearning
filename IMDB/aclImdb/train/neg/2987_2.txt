the dubbingtranslation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick i havent laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 and ive seen some really bad dubbing in my life believe me seriously the filmmakers could reedit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars its just that funnybr br but if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isnt your cup of tea then avoid this at all costs
