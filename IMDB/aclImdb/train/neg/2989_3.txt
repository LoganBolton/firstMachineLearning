although the likeliness of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80 for this movie is low i feel that i have to say something about this one i am not the kind of moviewatcher who pays attention to production value thoughtprovoking dialog or brilliant acting  directing however i claim that this movie sucks i dont know why i dont like it i mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie blood outrageousness unintentional humor etc according to this evidence it should be my favorite still zombi 3 is a baaad moviebr br there are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water this spoils nothing so dont worry she walks into what i see as an abandoned hotel or something did she not see that there was a friggin lake in the middle of the building yes shes looking for water and passes up a lake why cuz she wants to know why the people who arent there cuz the place is abandoned wont answer her when she calls out is anybody there oh this is just a little insignificant piece of the big picture im paintingbr br there is a reason though why i gave this film more than 1 star its one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is like i have a few times youll want to watch it again because its just so overthetop in every aspect i called it blood in the first paragraph but this movie has no blood it has an ocean of gore also it has pretty weird creatures in it as well a zombiebaby with an adultsize hand and a magically flying head to name just twobr br you know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with 50s scifi movies i believe that zombi 3 and movies like it should top those it has all the elements scientists arguing with the government warnings of the apocalypse on the radio armies battling monsters and so on this is the plan 9 of the 80s while i wont say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it just expect the very worst and when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating zombi 3 it wont be all that bad you might actually like it im not saying thats impossiblebr br dont think i hate this movie i dont really oh ps killing birds aka zombie 5 rules did i just blow my credibility
