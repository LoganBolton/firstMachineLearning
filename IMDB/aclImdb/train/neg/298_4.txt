daraar got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla by the way dont you think hes a little old for herbr br things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an overprotective neatfreak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason one of the reasons i really dont like this movie is because i cant stand to see juhi my favorite actress get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickeningbr br anyway all im trying to say is if youre thinking about renting daraar you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else
