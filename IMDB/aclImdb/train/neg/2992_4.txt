next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror subgenre while slasher films had black christmas and halloween to get the whole thing going zombie flicks had george romeros dead films and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series other directors wanted to cash in a lot of italian directors were especially interested such as lucio fulci who brought us zombie a year after romeros dawn of the dead known as zombi in italy and some other countries and it was there that fulcis film was known as zombi 2 apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romeros film but is a good film in its own right it was a big success in europe and 9 years later a sequel was bornbr br pros lots of beautiful lush scenery awesome score the acting isnt exactly good but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience after kind of a slow start the pace moves along like that of an action flick plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers good job on the makeup effects lots of blood and some decent gorebr br cons virtually plot less nothing you havent already seen before blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of return of the living dead films cardboard characters hasnt aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock musicnot that im saying all rock music of that period is bad clothing and overall feel of the moviebr br final thoughts first of all this is not a true sequel to fulcis cult classic in fact i dont know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off for those that dont know fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei matteis films are pretty laughable but like this film many are good campy fun and thats all this film really is just something to watch for funbr br my rating 355 sobaditsgood rating 25 serious rating
