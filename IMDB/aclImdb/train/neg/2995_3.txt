only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the xfiles fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watcha detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstancesthe deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took placemulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revengenow for the bizarre bitthe little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnationi think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in xfiles history
