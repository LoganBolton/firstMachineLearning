born again is a substandard episode from season one it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesnt fly ive never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode but the positives end there which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode i think its ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge theres even a serious lack of witty mulder  scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat if youre into reincarnation maybe this episode is up your alley if youre not then at least you can learn what bradycardia is
