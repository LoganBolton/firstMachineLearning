this was filmed backtoback with the 1992 remake of conan doyles famous novel the lost world and it showsbr br the film starts promisingly enough with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau but then things go downhill everybody is stranded on the plateau and were left with a feeble boring overlength rehash of the first filmbr br the dinosaurs who are hardly ever seen are just laughable are we expected to take that cuddly toy thats supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously and the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spotbr br do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the lost world unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent remake
