for diehard judy garland fans only there are two 2 numbers that are really good  one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady youve all seen the pics and a pretty good number at the very end there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny but basically the script is so bad and the movie so dated that its hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout but its worth the 250 to rent the movie  just be prepared to fastforward it
