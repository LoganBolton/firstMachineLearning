this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana1995 and agnisakshi1996br br agnisakshi was the only one which worked and was a better filmbr br daraar is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt herebr br the story was good but the handling wasnt that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointingbr br direction is bad music is goodbr br rishi reprises his role of yaaranastrangely which also was a remake of swte and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
