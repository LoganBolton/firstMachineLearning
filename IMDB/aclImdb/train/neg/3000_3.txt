the school nerd marty simon scuddamore is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion set by them also where his face is scarred by acid years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school since closed for a reunion what they didnt know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them then a storm starts theyre locked in the school and marty starts to take revengebr br pretty silly the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted schoolbut thats about it the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel hes stripped has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt and are just uncomfortable to watch considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity there is full frontal of scuddamore surprising for any movie but one girl decides to take a bath aloneafter they know a killer is wandering around after them and then theres the couple that has to have sex this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv the acting is bearablenot good but bearable caroline munro is in this too shes a very beautiful woman but not much of an actressbr br this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere otherwise its run of the mill and forgettable scuddamores tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves
