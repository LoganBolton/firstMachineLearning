the movie opens with a flashback to doddsville county high school on april fools day a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty when they are punished for playing said prank they follow up with a bigger prank which par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough fast forward five years where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious jester maskclad murderer in increasingly complicated and mindnumbingly ludicrous fashions it doesnt take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killers identity as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors only to be haunted by their ghosts marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life finally the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed breaks free of his restraints stabs a nurse and finally disfigures his own facebr br the script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic the only originality comes from the mindnumbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched the absurd itwasalladream ending feels tacked on its almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dreambr br technically speaking the film is atrocious some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television the acting is subpar even for slasher films i cant help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them cant bother to keep their accents straight through the moviebr br all of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too it isnt the worst film of the genre but its far from the best
