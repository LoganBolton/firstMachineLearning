beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum that there might be a connection between the presentday asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentionedbr br at the same time theres an effort to present edward burtynskys photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful much of the film is a slide show of these images they are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions to me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented industrial waste is still industrial waste the relationship if any between the photographs and the films spoken message remains unclearbr br i dont mean to imply that there arent real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize manufactured landscapes however offers only strange and bitter hopelessness its like a twohour lecture by noam chomsky maybe it has some value as a demonstration of whats wrong with the american and canadian left
