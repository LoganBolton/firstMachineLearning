i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like man on fire to find out that the movie its the furthest thing from it the story was treading water from the get go and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea and the whole armscene was too gratuitous br br the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly and this movie reveals that shell never become a movie star the movie brought some of the worst acting everbr br i like tony scotts direction n all but this takes the whole friggin cake sorry ton 1 out of 10
