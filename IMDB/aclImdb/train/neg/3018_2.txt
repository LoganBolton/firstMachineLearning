what do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you dont care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget why you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made im referring of course to dominobr br here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this moviebr br ooh wow the storyline is told out of sequence that hasnt been done a billion times before and much more skillfully than in this moviebr br wow look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions the director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style its just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes theyre in and its also too bad that most of them come across as irritatingbr br ive heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies beforebr br ive seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies beforebr br this one toobr br uh didnt they reveal this plot twist about half an hour ago was that supposed to be surprisingbr br if this movie is supposed to be showing a tough chick going around kicking ass when why doesnt she do very much of itbr br i cant believe how unoriginal this dialogue isbr br how long is this thing i feel like ive been watching it for over four hours alreadybr br i have no idea what just happened but also i dont particularly feel motivated to try to figure it outbr br is this over yetbr br i want my money backbr br the songs in this soundtrack feel so misused herebr br its ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each onebr br ughbr br and finally i might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to mebr br in summation this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect avoid watching it at all costs if your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isnt flammable you should seriously consider being burned alive insteadbr br if i sound bitter its because i just spent over two hours watching this movie and uh i didnt enjoy it very much
