how can you take her hardliving glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent its absurd apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangstermovie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback  mostly out of sequence  seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that dont really happen and then later says that didnt really happen this happened  see the apparent killing of the fake first ladies what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for thenbr br terrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headacheinducing directorial style 15
