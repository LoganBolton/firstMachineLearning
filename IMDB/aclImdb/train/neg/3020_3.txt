what of domino did i hate over everything and i mean everything else perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face maybe its the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as theyre uttered by people like kiera knightly who if you buy as a bounty hunter then youll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012br br nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility absolutely nobody at all it is a painful and misguided experience taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them the principal question is was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think shes coming across as tough but really she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school attempting to impress her peers there are things you genuinely dont know how to react to whether theyre supposed to be funny or not if it is supposed to be a comedy that begs the next question is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs i dont think sobr br the film opens with the title card based on a true storysort of if thats supposed to be some sort of postmodernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose then youre simply on another planet truth is in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying sort of which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer following this we learn of dominos relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the sort of cop out as in real life she was just four but if the film had gone by realitys dates then her entire drive wouldve been born out of the death ofher goldfishbr br we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey rourke domino knightley herself and wouldbe love interest choco ramírez during the scene an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her sons life to be spared what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers fire off weapons at innocents we dont know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogsbr br the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads a feeling of no why are you doing this why is this happening bad seeds are planted and wouldnt you know it they stick the film is painful to watch excruciating even as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills 90210 here is another daft postmodernist slant people playing themselves and that sort of joker card being played again christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jrs natural born killers characterbr br so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and chocos gang purely for her good looks i might add it appears amidst the plot to do with fake drivers registration ids or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another the problem is as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isnt a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up if there is any feeling between choco and domino it exists on such a small tiny minimalist scale that you have to ask why its even includedbr br so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrativewise we find out the reason for the fake ids that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded he mustve swam really quickly  double the speed of the films fasted edit which means something in the region of 01 of a second yeah sure the films story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up plus theres a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the films comedy runs so dry that it has to resort to the jerry jerry chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show when did we last laugh at jerry jerry when we were say seven years old i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a films existence
