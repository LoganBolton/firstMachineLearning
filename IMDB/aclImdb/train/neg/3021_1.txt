tony scott has never been a very good director but every film hes made after crimson tide seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today michael bay may fall into the same category but at least his big dumb delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level and like other overblown hollywood biopics delovely and confessions of a dangerous mind for instance chronicling the lives of pretentious overrated or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of mystique by a society that thrives on the juicy behindthescenes details domino is a film that begins with little potential and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixtyminute mark with an alreadydistended running time of 128 minutes the film feels twice as long and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable unlike the superior rules of attraction scotts attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via dominos smug selfawarerichgirl voiceover only draws attention to the films sledgehammer cluelessness becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable the story spoileduppercrustbabe domino harvey keira knightley in an ersatzbadass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in los angeles and accosts gruff bounty hunters mickey rourke and edgar ramirez to learn a more exciting trade along the way there are doublecrosses shootouts media attention courtesy of a tongueincheek christopher walken phoning in his trademark sleazebag and laughable hints at romance scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds cranking up the resolution to make the film a neondrenched nightmare thats frankly unpleasant to watchif scotts given an opportunity to shakily frame an image ghost it or distort it in some way he will but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot characterization and suspense the film has to say nothing for its ehm entertainment value most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical oftentimes both observe the unbearable severalminute segment where an africanamerican introduces a new list of racial categorizations on jerry springer and i found myself wishing they would all get the tails end of our protagonists coin by the end domino is utter unmitigated trashwhatever interest in this individual scott hoped to inspire in his audience it is lost in a sea of migraineinducing neon pretension a few minutes in
