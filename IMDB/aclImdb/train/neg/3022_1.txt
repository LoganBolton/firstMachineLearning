i was very excited about this film when i first saw the previews normally i see a preview this good and i buy the film outright something told me to you know watch it first im glad i did keira knightley ruined all future films for me with this role in the 2nd pirates movie when it came out i went to see it all i saw was domino harvey and i hated her more for it i think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for dominobr br domino who who is domino harvey i still dont really know or care i dont know who she was in real life or who she was in this film i didnt care about her character and even keira getting partically naked didnt make it worth the movie the direction was definitely lacking the writing was trite and shallow the editing was horrible i dont mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it theres a place for it good examples of choppy mtv style colorful editing not sure if theres an official name would be fight club just off the top of my head even enemy of the state had a semi similar editing style at parts it was used tastefully and wasnt used as a crutch i mean this is the same guy who directed top gun and crimson tide tony scott please give me my time backbr br i understand there are many people who liked this movie i guess the idea that youll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment frankly i hate it
