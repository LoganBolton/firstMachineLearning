this film is really bad no i mean really really bad tony scott is a terrible director out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time what appalled me the most is richard kelly director of donnie darko did the screenplay to this now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lessonbr br now i love mickey rourkes new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it dont get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few accidences in his time and this is one of them i dont know what to say about keira knightly i think shes a little too overrated i just cant feel for her in filmsbr br all in all this film is bad thats it 110jd seaton
