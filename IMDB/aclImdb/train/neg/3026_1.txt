supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter id say 95  is fabricated i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies however this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film something i cant stand and to top it off the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant bch i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head its too incoherent too flashy and way too boring its a who gives a crap kinda story and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writers own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brats life
