my flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it togetherbr br the first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy postmtv texture fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves  for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another snatch for the momentbr br when the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one overdosed amphetamine things just dont make sense anymore i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching itbr br first you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between keira knightley and lucy liu wrong this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever rather on the contrary dominos lesbian come on on lucy lius character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusionbr br then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter in any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes but after that the question of dominos character is entirely lost to the criminal plot so in short no this is not a movie about dominos characterbr br then i thought its probably a story of one robbery a pretty bloody robbery 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc but soon this impression is dispelled by another uturn of the plotbr br this time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese afroamerican woman who fakes drivers licenses at the local mvd and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother lateesha stars on jerry springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughterbr br what does this have to do with the main plot urgh well nobody knows except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors fee of 300000br br then at some point you start to think oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes but no this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the moviebr br plus there are numerous other subplots the crazy afghani guy bent on liberating afghanistan the love story between domino and chocco the mescaline episode the fbi surveillance operationbr br can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear  it is a veritable mess
