tony scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in richard kellys clich√©d patchy overwrought screenplay domino harvey kiera knightley was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter this is her story sort ofbr br the problem with this rubbish is that there isnt much of a story at all and scotts extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in harveys chaotic lifebr br you just dont care about harvey knightley plays her as an obnoxious cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect she punches people she doesnt like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it but she isnt the least bit real and knightly isnt the least bit convincing eitherbr br the film is boring its loud too and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores ive heard in a long time the final twenty minutes are a poor rerun of scotts true romance climax with dominos gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are  surprise surprise  destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a las vegas casinobr br unfortunately this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by scott and becomes a confusing pretentious pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation this is not an artistically brave or experimental piece it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its charactersbr br mickey roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses chris walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and dabney coleman always solid is underutilizedbr br dont be fooled by this films multilayered gimmickridden surface it is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it
