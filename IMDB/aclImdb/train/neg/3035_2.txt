weve been served  a terrible filmbr br okay ill admit that since im white and have had no practical experience in the competitive world of stepdancing i might not exactly be an authority on this type of film on the other hand i do know a bad motion picture when i see itbr br and boy have i just seen itbr br filmed in lowbudgetvision and directed by ian iqubal rashid a touch of pink how she move tells the tale of how important it is to follow ones dreams  even if those dreams include bopping around to loud irritating hiphop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translatorbr br ill try to give a small synopsis of the plot first of all there are two actors that look like ll cool j who work in an auto shop in toronto the mecca of racial diversity but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day br br there are a few other guys in this crew including a token white dude and a guy that looks like denzel washington in malcolm x there are also two women in the movie  one resembles serena williams and the other looks like geraldine from the old flip wilson show one of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drugaddicted sibling the other girl a member of salt n pepa no doubt is just plain no goodbr br theres another guy who looks like eddie murphys buckwheat while still another actor whos a huggy bear knockoff these guys are rival step dancers evidently this activity is very hardcore in the hood and they are all practicing for the big step monster jam in detroitbr br since i was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue perhaps some subtitles would have been useful as in a bergman film or that one music video by snow its hard to explain what happens other than theres a lot of arguing the serena williams girl who never smiles by the way becomes a freelance stepper moving from group to group theres some stepdancing and a lot of irritating hiphop musicbr br its a typical ragstoriches story sort of like rocky with a really bad soundtrack rudy with annoying rap music in the background cry freedom without the laughs br br but why does a film  which could have made a big impact on black audiences  have to contain drug addiction bad parents and a title that sounds like a firstgrader saying the phrase how she movesbr br i was moved by this movie however moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible
