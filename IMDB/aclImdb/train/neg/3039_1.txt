i can always tell when something is going to be a hit i see it or hear it and get a good feeling i did not get a good feeling watching the preview i was not at all enthusiastic about this film and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films i was in fact proved rightbr br the first thing that threw me off was the title not that i have a problem with ebonicsi am black by the way but for a movie they could have used a better title and for this time use a title that doesnt have bad grammar i heard the dialog saw the acting and all i could do was make facesbr br i also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone at least you got served was better than this in my opinion even the soundtrack didnt thrill me
