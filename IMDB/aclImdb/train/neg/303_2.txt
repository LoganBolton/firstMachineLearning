its impossible for me to objectively consider this movie not that i havent tried mind you  but i sit down and i pop in the aged vhs and i watch the openingand suddenly im five years old again and clutching my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heartbr br i can see objectively that this movie is a bizarre combination of cuddly baby merchandisingmascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation but my inner fiveyearold goes yay care bears every time i think about it so  id only cautiously reluctantly recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it like me or those lovably cynical genxyers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully badstrange a category in which this moviedefinitely belongs to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment you might want to keep looking
