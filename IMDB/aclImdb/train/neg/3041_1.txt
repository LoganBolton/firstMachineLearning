yes i have rated this film as one star awful yet it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth this truly is so bad its good this is another kgordon murray production read buys a really cheapbad mexican movie spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matin√©es in the mid 1960s its a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as im sure some mood enhancers would make this an even better experience im not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said a christmas movie with merlin the devil mechanical windup reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammars a christmas carol truly a holiday experience made in hell now if i can only find to all a goodnight aka slayride on dvd ill have a triple feature that cant be beat you have to see this movie it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward buttonespecially on the two dance routines this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheeseguess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience feliz navidad amigos
