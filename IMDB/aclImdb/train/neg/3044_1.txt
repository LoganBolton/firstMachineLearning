this is kind of a weird movie given that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against satan and his minionsbut its still kinda funbr br it has some genuine laughswhether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable though this movie is not good but i can say i really enjoyed watching itbr br i would recommend this movie over santa claus conquers the martians santa claus with dudley moore and john lithgow or the santa clause with tim allen
