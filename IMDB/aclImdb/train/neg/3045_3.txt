believe it or dont i have my very own dvd copy of this movie which i bought at walgreens for a great big whole dollar im still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wastedbr br pretty amazing set designs and costumes apparently much thought and effort went into their making the set designs are very mexican in stylization i liked them a lot and santa is impressive one of the more impressive santas in moviedombr br im guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience but somehow it comes across quite deranged in fact im left stunned at how deranged it isbr br maybe its the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very very weirdbr br did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns you didnt neither did i until i watched this movie one learns something new everydaybr br is this movie actually worth watching now thats a tossup i cant in good conscience recommend it to anyone as its quite disturbing in its own bizarre way yet its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching you decide what youre going to do i dunno for myself it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves now thats just wrong
