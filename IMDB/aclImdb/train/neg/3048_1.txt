this is perhaps the creepiest display of santa claus ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing merlin in to help him defeat one of satans minions pitch doesnt make things any better its laughable to say the least with bad effects even for 1959 standards if a kid were to watch this movie hed have nightmares and never want santa to visit theyd be scarred for life imagine the kids in a christmas story when they start screaming after being put on santas lap thats how this would turn out if kids see this movie
