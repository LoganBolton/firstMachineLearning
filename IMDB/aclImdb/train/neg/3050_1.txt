just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a bomb rating a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night i feared the worst knowing its reputation and it was as godawful as id anticipated this is a mexicanmade mess dubbed into english and produced by k gordon murray its got terrible sets and effects and features a rather frightening santa who doesnt operate at the north pole but instead from a cloud in outer space and who doesnt have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is the opening sequence where st nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages seems to go on forever and with no story obviously this santa claus doesnt observe the child labor lawsbr br eventually we get some nasty and slinky redsuited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth just to make little kids naughty and turn santas christmas eve rounds into a nightmare watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience and its bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever oddly the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on this easily makes my personal list of the worst movie ive ever seen but im sure thats nothing unique
