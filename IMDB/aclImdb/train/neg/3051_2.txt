this was another obscure christmasrelated title a lowbudget mexican production from exploitation filmmaker cardona night of the bloody apes 1969 tintorera 1977 which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the us by k gordon murray judging by those two efforts already mentioned cardona was no visionary  and this one having already received its share of flak over here is certainly no better the film in fact is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color which in view of the prominence of reds  apart from st nick himself the devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout was essential anyway in a nutshell the plot involves satans efforts to stall santa claus christmas eve rendezvous with the earths children there is however plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with our portly whitebearded and chronically merry maninred lives in a celestial palace who apart from accompanying toymaker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing laboriously for the whole first reel in their native tongue visits merlin  the famed magician at king arthurs court here bafflingly but amusingly prone to childlike hopping and mumbling gibberish  once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible by the way the wizards anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr frankenstein in son of dracula 1974 incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess weightso santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney the devils antics enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up to hold up st nicks delivery program then is perfectly puerile indeed their titfortat shenanigans resemble an old laurel  hardy routine more than anything to pad out the runningtime we focus on three sets of children one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company projected as a wishfulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extralarge packages a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own the horned one first tempts her to steal one then invades the little ones dreams  to no avail and a trio of brats who egged on once again by satan think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves there is definitely imagination at work here but it is applied with little rhyme or reason while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay
