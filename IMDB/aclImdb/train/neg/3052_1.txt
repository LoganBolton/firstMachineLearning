this santa movie starts off strange and i think santa might be a pedo instead of the usual elf toy makers this santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from its a small world i guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives its apparently not the north pole and not on earth none of these kids seem very happy and i kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes though i guess for some of the third world kids these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops i sure hope that all they do is sing and make toysbr br then the scene abruptly changes to hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a busby berkeley musical this fun in put to a stop by satan who orders one of them pitch to go to earth to ruin christmas personally i thought this movie already did that the devil and his imps are actually kind of cutelike hot stuff from the harvey comics but with cool evil goatees or if you are puerto rican like a vejigante mask with a goatee br br somehow a povertystricken mexican kid named lupita a group of jerky kids who want to mug santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the devil and santa so if the prince of darkness not donald trump its the other prince of darkness can somehow make her steal and be bad hell winwhat we dont really know in fact as they root her on you get the impression that the film makers intend santa to be jesusas he has all these great powers and fights the devil over kids souls later santa meets with his friend merlin he asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams considering how much santa laughs in the film like a demented chipmunk i assume he must use this drug a lot he immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens all doors considering he keeps kids as his personal assistants this magic key thing worries me immensely during santas christmas eve ride you see lupita behave like a little angelone problem down santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks he gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problemstwo problems solved this is a rare case where alcoholdrugs help kids and solves problems and as for the little muggers he gives them coal frustrated with his losses to santa pitch then tries to steal the sleigh which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer when this fails he destroys santas stash of magic powder as a result santa cant become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed uh ohhow can santa take a detour to the betty ford clinic if hes stuck up a tree will st nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win if you care tune in and see however be warned that the film is batcrap crazy br br technically speaking the film is yecchy while it is in color its really gaudy the music is mostly done on an organwhich along with bad singing from the kids produces perhaps the worst soundtrack ive heard in recent memory and the story is just incomprehensible and very very very creepy devils and a santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creeptastic its a film you should never show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish
