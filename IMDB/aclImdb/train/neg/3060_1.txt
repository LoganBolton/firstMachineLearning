this has to be creepiest most twisted holiday film that ive ever clapped eyes on and thats saying something i know that the mexican people have some odd ideas about religion mixing up ancient aztec beliefs with traditional christian theology but their day of the dead isnt half as scary as their take on santa clausbr br sosanta isnt some jolly fat redsuited alcoholictake a look at those rosy cheeks sometime rather hes a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in heavenor the heavens whichever with a bunch of kids who work harder than the ones in kathy lee giffords sweat shops they sing ohsocute traditional songs of their homelands while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there wasnt a little africanamerican boy in black face singing mammy this santa is a peeping tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his eye in the sky this is so he can tell whos been naughty or nicewith an emphasis on those who are naughty id betbr br theres no mrs claus no elveswhat does he need elves for when hes got child labor and the reindeer are mechanical windup toys this floating freak show hovers on a cloud presumably held up by its silver liningbr br santas nemesis isthe devil what is this santa our lord and savior weird anyhoo satan sends one of his minions a mincing prancing devil named pitch to try to screw up christmas let me get this straightthe forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday seems kind of redundant doesnt itbr br pitch is totally ineffectual he tries to talk some children into being bad but doesnt have much luck i was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl lupe whos family is very poor all that she wants is a doll for christmas but he parents cant afford to buy her onethey spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of so pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll in reality thats the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll because being saintly and praying to god and holy santa doesnt really work but lupe resists temptation and tells pitch to get thee behind her and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that its chuckys sisterbr br along the way pitch manages to get santa stuck in a treeuhhuh from whence hes rescued by merlin merlin you have got to be kidding me since when do mythical druidic figures appear in christmas tales or have anything to do with a christian religion and doesnt god disapprove of magic theyd have been burning merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago not asking him to come to the rescue of one of gods aspectsor thats what i assume santa must be to be going up against satan this movie is one long huh from start to finish and itll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasnt spiked or something probably it was since this movie is like one long giant dt
