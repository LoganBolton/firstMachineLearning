some might say something like baby geniuses with its giant robot infants or dumbo with its psychedelic drugaddled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children you might say that too but youd be wrong lo and behold for i bring to you santa claus the most helplessly messed up family film since  well ever br br from the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs seriously this segment is nearly 20 freakin minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot to the thrilling conclusion in which merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day dont mind him hes from barcelona this is childhood trauma at its finest and no matter how hard i try no matter how many different therapists i visit i just cant get those reindeerslaughterout of my  head br br avoid this mindbending piece of trash like youd avoid a sexstarved whale during mating season still if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you i guess you should give it a try but really this movie isnt worth your time and mental health
