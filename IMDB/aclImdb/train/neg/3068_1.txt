movies like these are to the originals what album oriented rock stations are to what music used to be like  repetitive boring and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones i am glad that aragorn wasnt typecast as an expectant psycho by this pos go back and watch the 1971 version count the things that would never be included in a modern version and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasnt based on someone elses ideas and wasnt passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day
