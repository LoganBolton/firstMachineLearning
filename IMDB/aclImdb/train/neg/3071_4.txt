i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting i never had to read this book thankfully or it would have been a painful experience i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasnt worth my time or my friends i think this story is not worth telling its like saying that old people have a past before they got old no kidding the lives of the main characters were painful to watch one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes however i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story ive always been a big fan of ellen burstyn im writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try
