yep this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies but i have definately seen worse think gremlins rated r well anyway i met rick sloane at some scifi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at it was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and i brought inbr br he seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the mst3k versionbr br all in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks so i guess im standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 and betraying all my fellow msties sorry guys
