description corny utterly stupid and worthless its so cheap and lame itll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget im guessing this probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater i am giving you the best advice in the worldbr br spare yourself spare your time life and money by noti repeat not even ponder about whether you should see this movie this movie is so corny itll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom if you have a onedigit iq then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie you might actually admire it like i said before if you have a onedigit iqbr br with about 12 actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music i gaurentee youll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap
