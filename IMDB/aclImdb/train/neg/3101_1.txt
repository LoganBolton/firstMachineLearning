this rip off of the 1984 hit gremlins is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made even for a b grade movie all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot acting and goodnessbr br it begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance why because a few minutes into the film he walks into the forbidden safe and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pubbr br this is just an appetizer for the scatfilled main course the main character kevin struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy perhaps he succeeds within the film but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard and is guided through his security shift in the wait for it abandoned studio lot yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself back to the film kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the hobgoblins the hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason they must be returned before sunrise or elseor else what exactlybr br other characters include kevins macho army friend nick nicks woman daphne whose character has no more substance than a bitchslut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits there is kevins manipulative and reserved girlfriend amy whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed cher lookalike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top dont ask me how that works quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is kyle how such groups of friends are made is up for question kyle is a perverted creep who cant go an hour without selfstimulating his hobbies include calling up sexchat lines from other peoples houses and most likely sniffing underwearbr br the story unfolds as the heroes search for the hobgoblins kneehigh creatures aka hand puppets which for some reason attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars or the film having a big budgetbr br warning spoilers ahead the twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering what the hobgoblins are returned to the safe bytheir own free will perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc or perhaps the storywriters got writers cramp and decided not to worry about the ending upon returning to the safe the old security guard reveals what he learned in the military and detonates explosives which destroys the safe signaling the end of the evil hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride better fitted to a ride on an escalatorbr br the sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears if you plan to watch it i recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind
