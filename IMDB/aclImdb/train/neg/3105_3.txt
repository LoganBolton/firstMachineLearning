i cant believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about real homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they dont eat quite as often brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin
