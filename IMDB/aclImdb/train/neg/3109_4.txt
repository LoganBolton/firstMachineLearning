this movie wasnt awful but it wasnt very good i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid the book is great and he cantt believe a kid wrote it toni collette plays the kids guardian who you dont know if this kid really exists or if shes making it all up i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scarybr br the acting is pretty good and toni collettes performance was awesome as well as robin williams br br the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd
