i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offeredbr br why i didnt walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately several people in our theater did and sadly i didnt follow them outbr br the story lacked all criteria for a movie no plot awful acting even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk i did like the tazer scene too bad it didnt shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film
