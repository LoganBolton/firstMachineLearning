this movie is a mess im surprised it even has a theatrical release without robin williams it would have gone straight to video it is poorly written it is poorly directed its worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logicespecially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience i saw it with was laughing at it save your money the trailer is totally misleading  it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills  in fact the movies truly worst offense is that it is simply boring
