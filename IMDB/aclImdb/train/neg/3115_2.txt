i rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt complied to night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seenbr br there was nothing happening in this film what so ever  i didnt care for any of the characters didnt buy in to the whole mystery type plot didnt care how it endednothingbr br there is no comedy no action no thrills no suspense nothing the highlights include no spoilers  theres nothing to spoil a man climbing through a window a dog barking outside a hotel room a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping its hornbr br i really enjoyed one hour photo and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams but alas was sorely let down whats more disappointing is that im sure there is a good film in there somewhere  the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters but it just didnt work for mebr br i might even have given it 110 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers
