i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plotkept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst filmsif you dont believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that dont do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it this was on a friday night the 950 showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying
