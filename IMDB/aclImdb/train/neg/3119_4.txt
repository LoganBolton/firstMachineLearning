robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members however the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a must see i think the problem happens because there isnt a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel nooni had to spell it this way because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to no one character the movie runs a little over 0130 and within the first 15 minutes or so it seems noon begins his search for pete logande the boy callerbr br this happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times the conversations arent too indepth mostly consisting of how are you im in the hospitalwhy did you boyfriend move out etc in the book the kid almost becomes noons shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoaxbr br in the movie noon becomes obsessed with finding logande but the audience is left to wonder why since there really isnt a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller why bother who cares if the caller doesnt exist br br i know theres a difference between a book and a movie but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie since it doesnt the movie falls apartbr br this is surprising because of maupins other work tales of the city when it was made into a miniseries it worked beautifully
