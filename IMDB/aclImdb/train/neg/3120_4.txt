i didnt really expect much from the night listener and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore however the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension on occasion it drags a little but it actually helps to keep you wondering whats going to happen and more importantly when as the movie progresses the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of cat and mouse spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that noone seemed to have ever seen in person the night listener is an interesting story which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and youre pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and whats real however in the end it kind of disappoints and doesnt live up to the potential it could have had it doesnt really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character which would have been helpful and interesting
