this movie is trashpoor it has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on realevents  which doesnt add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are outofplace not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story to start williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting whats worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting dcksmker  in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end toni colletes character is just plain annoying and a rehash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction very missable
