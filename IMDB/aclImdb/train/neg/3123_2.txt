felt mine was while watching thisbut it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film not that makes a lot of sense anyway as others have mentioned this was one of karloffs last films and its only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all its sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this marginally boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much br br boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together the strident background music doesnt help and distracts from any lucid moment apart from boris the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange clipped english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies br br at a guess i think its edgar allen poes house of usher that this is taken from but youd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished articlebr br still there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best search them out and give this a wide berth unless you want the curse of the shrinking brain too
