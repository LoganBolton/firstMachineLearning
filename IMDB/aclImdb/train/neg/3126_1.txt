mr vanhook took a good idea and kicked like a football unfortunately it didnt make the goal the historical subject of giants is a good one but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese i say take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff i couldnt even watch the entire film that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie i always like to give them a chance for lastminute redemption its impossible to redeem something this bad well at least the acting was goodnot br br the only thing falling in this film is the rating 110 and sinking into the negative numbers
