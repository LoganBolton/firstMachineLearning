if youve ever seen this movie youd know that it if you havent and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if youre really bored go rent it if you want to know what its like heres my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesnt like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes but wait it only gets worse youll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is
