the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher casper van dien in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant now theres something you dont see everyday matt is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to build a holiday resort on the land  he calls in fellow archaeologist angela kristen miller for reasons im unsure of anyway they both try to figure out what theyve got on theyre hands when some of the team go missing morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would  is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up  take over the world for the fallen one or something like that its up to matt to save the day  the whole planetbr br written  directed by kevin vanhook who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film  its as simple  straight forward as that there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical  conceptual level the script doesnt make a whole lot of sense  it doesnt really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live the characters are awful  as clich√©d as you like the dialogue is bad as in very very bad  the entire film is predictable i mean its not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it its not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state this is bad very bad you have been warnedbr br director vanhook doesnt impress the fight scenes are absolutely awful  why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple they look naff to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although theres not that many of them since he doesnt make an appearance for over an hour there are also some normal sized mummys that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy 1999 unfortunately these arent used to any great effect  in fact are wasted as some comic relief the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly  there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is forget about any scares tension or atmosphere  dont even think about any gore or violence because there isnt anybr br technically the fallen ones isnt anything special  apart from the impressive giant mummy effects theres little her to get excited about the ghost cgi  water effects are terrible it was madefortv  its shows the acting was poor wagner looks embarrassed  this is probably the only thing the likes of dien  bosley can get these daysbr br the fallen ones is a bad film theres no two ways about it as far as im concerned not recommended on any level or in any way one to avoid
