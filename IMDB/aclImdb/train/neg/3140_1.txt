what i think ill probably like best about the new star wars film phantom menace is that it will likely blow titanic out of the water if youll pardon the pun when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts and thereby knock it out of the number one spot every time i hear someone declare titanic is the greatest film theyve ever seen i think to myself you dont see a lot of movies do you what a travesty you could make 50 good films that are a lot better than titanic and for the same price tagbr br well it won lots of academy awards lots of people really loved it as someone might say in its defence well lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonalds but that doesnt mean its high quality yes millions of elvis fans can be wrongbr br ill be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the megahype over the film i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately it didnt live up to the expectations set upon it which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story its true phantom menace will likely suffer a similar fate butbr br james camerons titanic is a a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece b a threehour epic that has its finest moments given away in the trailer c a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment d something left better to documentarians which i wouldve enjoyed much more e a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship f a robbery of 3 hours that i will never get back therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of when i meet someone who hasnt seen it yet i say i wish i could trade places with you g a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences h thankfully a film that wasnt recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars i a technological achievement in filmmaking and little elsebr br the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of 10000 thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans wholl no doubt come to his defense and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of titanics story acting or length
