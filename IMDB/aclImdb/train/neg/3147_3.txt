elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film considering the money and cast youd sure expect the film to be a lot better though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor its not just the age difference but i just cant see the pair as a couple perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute due to miss leighs deteriorating mental conditionthough i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well in addition for an english woman miss taylor doesnt even seem to try using an accentbr br the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england their plan is to return to finchs tea plantation in ceylon sri lanka and at first it seems like a good life however there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her on top of that once back home finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her however taylor isnt yet ready to abandon her marriage but through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leavewhen out of the blue cholera strikes the plantation so its up to andrews finch and taylor to work together to save the daythough by this point i really didnt care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you cant understand why taylor didnt leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hellbr br the film isnt particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount the film is a sluggish mess i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasnt integrated well in one scene for instance taylor finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown its clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake despite its budget its just not a very good or inspired filmbr br by the way could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film in some scenes particularly at the beginning shes wearing billowy clothes has a doublechin and looks puffy this isnt a criticismafter all women do get pregnant but if you look carefully youll see what i meanbr br also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to gianta great taylor film indeed its amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much
