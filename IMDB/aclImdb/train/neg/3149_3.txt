being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of edward d wood jr i purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant ed wood actually was br br what i got was a disappointing selfcentered conflictive contradictory compilation of bitter selfaggrandizing hasbeens br br where people do remember ed wood jr do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in plan nine from outer space br br it appears as though the very minute there is a renewed interest in ed wood these people come out of the woodwork only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when noone else would after 50 years i would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didnt get the 75 they were promisedbr br ed wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain infact that was all he lived for you may giggle when you see eds films but somehow you are aware that you are laughing with him and not at him br br but i digress back to the film at hand if you are expecting a film about edward d wood jr you wont get it here if you want a film about cranky bitter old actors this is the film for you
