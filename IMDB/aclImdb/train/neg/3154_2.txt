look theres nothing spectacularly offensive about this film its just boring its a typical romcom with an ending you can see coming before youve seen so much as the trailer the key difference is that the classic romcoms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago id recommend rewatching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation oh one other big problemno chemistry if youre used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias youre going to be seriously disappointed with the way theyve made him look here
