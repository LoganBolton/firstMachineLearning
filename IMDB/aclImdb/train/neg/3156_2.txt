i just want to make one thing clear i love michael vartan but this film really lets him down his acting is still superb hes still as charming as ever and he still looks great but the film itself is a load of rubbish natasha henstridge im sorry to say it comes over bit manly youre constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend whos own substoryline is a little weird myself and my family who sat down and watched the film with me were also put off by the soundtrack to the film at times the music just didnt fit with what was going on in the scenes however even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film i could forgive the leading ladys butchness i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold if youre a michael vartan fan skip this film buy yourself a poster instead
