sorry guys ive already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day i looked at some of the other reviews there are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but whats scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie i dont like to write nasty reviews or criticise other peoples opinions but i think its only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie this is not a good movie i really like movies and ill watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies i watched and was happy to leave halfway through if you really are incredibly tempted watch the trailerthats the mistake i made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailerafter that there are no surprises just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time i love michael vartan in alias and would hate to criticise him but i think its my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this
