this movie is one of the worst ones of the year the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible paul rudd is the only one that has any talent and the only one that is not annoying i have never watched desparte housewives so i dont know how eva longoria is on that show but in this movie she was horrible its like she knows nothing about acting all her character does is whine throughout the film and she cant pull off being a b and still be entertaining and the other girl lake bell displays little emotion and its like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads thembr br as for the story it is so cookie cutter it goes from point a to b with little surprise so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spiritbr br final verdict its not worth watching
