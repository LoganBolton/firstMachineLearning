there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood cary grant was an angel in the bishops wife 1947 of course the best were the topper movies in the late 30searly 40s and more recently warren beattys heaven can wait 1978 which was a remake of 1941s here comes mr jordan these were wellwritten funny entertaining comedies all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angelsbr br now comes writerdirector jeff lowell making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable bitchy young woman kate eva longoria parker who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist ashley lake bell who is falling for kates fianc√© henry paul rudd one thing that is clear at the outset longoria parker is no constance bennett marion kerby in the first two topper films who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measuredbr br there is a line right at the beginning when henrys sister chloe lindsay sloane tells henry you dont smile that aptly described my situation throughout this filmbr br the main problem with the film is that the script just isnt very funny but its made worse by longoria parkers presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen just to start out with compounding her lack of comedic talent she is covered with so much pancake makeup who knows what she really looks like kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue shes so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her well she actually just fades out so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission isbr br chloe wants henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after kates death from what i saw of kate he should have felt a wonderful relief so she introduces him to ashley who really doesnt know what shes doing as a spiritualist she is also a cateress to make ends meet to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate theres a lot of meshugaas that goes onbr br the vacuity of the film is epitomized by a b story revolving around ashleys assistant dan jason biggs this is thrown in near the end but the way ashley handles it indicates that shes as much of a boob as kate since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women he deserves whatever he getsbr br eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin it doesnt and mores the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny as it is norman z mcleod constance bennett roland young alan mowbray and co must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two topper films has wrought
