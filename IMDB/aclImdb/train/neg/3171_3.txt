was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen no was it the worst nobr br as a mother of four kids it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing it was great but it was cutebr br i think that it definitely had some room to improve but it triedbr br i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer they obviously do not care for eva longoria i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel i think that movies are a matter of opinion the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flopbr br maybe the cast did not work out maybe there were too many things going onbr br i just wanted to speak up for an average movie not a terrible one it could just be a chick flick kind of like the movie the splitup or french kiss my husband still talks about those
