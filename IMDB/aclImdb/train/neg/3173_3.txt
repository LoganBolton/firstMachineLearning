this movie is similar to the play entitled blithe spirit written by noel coward the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to cowards writing im surprised that movies of this nature dont acknowledge the original writers concept i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it isbr br sad these movies are so expensive to produce i do perk up when a screenplay is original i even perk up when its an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released there were some samples mentioned such as topper etc br br i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment however im not please when the publics taste is taken for granted in this situation the publics taste is overlookedbr br i look forward to better produced movie entertainmentbr br in this case i rather see the play
