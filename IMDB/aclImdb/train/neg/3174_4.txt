jeff lowell has written  directed over her dead body poorly the idea is first of all is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cakebr br minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performancebr br paul rudd looks jaded and least interested lake bell is a complete miscast she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance jason biggs is wasted so is lindsay sloanebr br i expected entertainment more from this film sadly i didnt get entertained
