this has to be the worst movie ive ever attempted to watch in the first 15 minutes there wasnt anything to keep my interest in this movie i was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to devote to a justforthefunofit movie the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock  they must have got it from the 1 store or somethingbr br if you like adam sandler this is nothing like any other movie hes made this started with a bad premise and then just got worse theres nothing even remotely funny in itbr br ive watched a lot of movies including some i didnt care for but if you decide to waste your time on this movie dont say i didnt warn you
