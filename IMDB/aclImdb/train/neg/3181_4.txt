this movie was not made by who fans most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the halfhour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over in christmas they didnt show daltrys screams after the line tommy doesnt know what day it is they showed almost no townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror and worst of all in the second half of were not gonna take it listening to you they robbed us of almost every shot of petes blazing guitar chords huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band its a very frustrating film to watch and doesnt deliver the goods i dont know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan or worse for him at least if he is a who fan and this is all the eight cameras could deliver for him to its credit there are some rare numbers before tommy as well as some faves that are very well shot and sometimes the editing is brilliant this might be enough to make some viewers happy as long as youre not anticipating tommy the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv it may be different on video or dvd
