ive never been impressed by jd anyway and final justice which i hadnt seen prior to its mst3k airing proves to be no exception its not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell its just that theres less that geronimo call me heronimo to dislikebr br in fact one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revengeseeking agent of joe dons trying to get the star killed by inducing a heart attackbr br joe don must have found a new agent since hes now graduated to comic relief in james bond movies the problem is its hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there and his serious characters in his actionmovies like this onebr br as for the plotumm what plot they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly youll think you were watching groundhogs day 2 presumably the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort ummm yeah whateverbr br on the plus side the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous so that kicked it up to a 2 for me one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades though
