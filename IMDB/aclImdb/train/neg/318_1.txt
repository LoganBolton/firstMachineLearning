i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college ive tried to watch it three times the second two because friends wanted to see it sweet adam sandler ive never heard of this movie but since hes so funny its gotta be funny wrong i cant make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing matchinsult war where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous but after watching this youll know its true this movie isnt worth the price i paid for it ive watched a ton of steven segal movies and ive even watched crossroads twice but i still couldnt watch this
