i cant believe this movie was made as recently as 1984 its got some laughable acting not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it  in fact its about as generic a title for a wannabe actioncop film as i can think ofbr br im glad i only saw this on mst3k with mike and the bots as a shield they remark on the female leads resemblance to elaine from seinfeld none of them are spongeworthy and riff nonstop on bakers weight this movie probably isnt worse than mitchell but bakers reputation definitely precedes him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i wouldnt have to read that
