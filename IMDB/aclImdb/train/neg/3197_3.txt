after apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss deputy sheriff thomas jefferson geronimo iii is assigned the task of taking the killer back to italy on the way however the plane is diverted to malta not long after landing the killer escapes now and with little help from the maltese police deputy sheriff geronimo is out to recapture a murderer but will his shoot first take names later brand of texas justice work in a foreign country br br let me get this out right up front ive seen final justice both with and without the mystery science theater 3000 commentary ive seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole and ive seen the cutup tv version that was used for mst3k having said that ive got to admit that i much prefer the mst3k version why because final justice is one lousy movie the mst3k commentary helps make it much more palatable on its own its a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue often delivered with such thick italian accents that its impossible to understand bad acting weak direction gigantic plot holes and most everything else youll find in a bad movie and if most of final justice wasnt so bad its good it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else so yes i enjoy the often very funny mst3k commentary over the bad movie on its ownbr br my main sticking points with the mst3k commentary and with most of the reviews ive read on final justice however involve the criticisms of joe don baker the main weaknesses in bakers performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction instead i think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place joe don baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor but hes not the kind of guy i would call an action hero by any stretch of the imagination hes more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of james bond movies or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with final justice point your finger at director greydon clark clarks resume cant begin to compare with bakers so i say lay off joe don baker
