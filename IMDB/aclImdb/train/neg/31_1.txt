this is the biggest insult to tmnt ever fortunantely officially venus does not exist in canon tmnt there will never be a female turtle this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own once gone no more the biggest mistake was crossing over power rangers to tmnt with a horrible episode the turtles voices were wrong and they all acted out of character they could have done such a better job better designs and animatronics and no venus br br dont bother with this peopleits cringe worthy material the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking they totally disrespected shredder the main baddie some dragonlord dude was corny the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies whats with the thing around raphs thigh the silly looking sculpted plastrons br br if they looked normal acted in character and got rid of venus got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon soundsand better writing it could have been good
