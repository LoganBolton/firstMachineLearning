if you ever hear these three words uttered to youjoe don baker be afraidbr br final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo pronounced as heronimo hes an ugly slimy rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie very bad editing joe don baker geronimo ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie making the plot go nowhere fast plus he shoots everybody like hes in the wild west i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta who looks like elaine from seinfeld and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck she must be insanebr br the strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women well at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable and i was happy it was finally over youll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the moviebr br its so hard to imagine how he was in three bond moviesvery weird anyway if youre up for a laugh then see this one on mst3k sometime also ive heard his other bad movie among many mitchell mst3k version is being released on dvd by rhino i cant wait to see that
