while not as bad as it has been made to be i have seen much worse this is still a very lame movie basically a rehash of siegels coogans bluff with the main difference being that clint eastwoods hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker an unappealing actor if there was onebr br however venantino venantini is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget vittorio gassman he is the main reason to sit through this steampile as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting specially the girl poor old rossano brazzi hard to believe he was once a romantic lead watch mondo cane to see him running away from women looking here like a secondtier ben gazzara hes given next to nothing to do its all joe dons show unfortunately and all of it scored to generic 80s action movie music that couldnt be more boringbr br greydon clark can make good bmovies without warning but here he trips falls breaks his nose and loses three teeth well at least the malta locations were nice and theres venantini to try to save the day 310
