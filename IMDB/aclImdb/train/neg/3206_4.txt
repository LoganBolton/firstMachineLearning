i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language not dialect as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie being a canadian of cebuano parents i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film i was further excited to hear that it wasnt another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies but alas i was shortchangedbr br panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano montano of course plays the hero of the movie and when i say hero i mean in the most stereotypical of manners his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bolanons to victory against the japanese his character has no depth or complexity he just fits the hero mold the rest of the characters are one dimensional they all fit their cookie cutter rolesbr br im all for slowmovingmeditative movies but this movie was just slow moving it didnt really meditate on anything just because a movie is historicallythemed a drama and slowmoving doesnt make it a wellmade filmbr br particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony his performance was embarrassingbr br if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc but really this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences even if it meant sacrificing quality obviously he didnt think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audienceattracting movie would have been at least a foot in the doorbr br im afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course id get an answer like visayans dont make good movies didnt you see panaghoy sa suba of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to seebr br an example of movies that are meditative not just slow moving are the tagalog film blackout or david lynchs the straight story i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of nontagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called pure cinema images without words are used to convey the story but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie and they do it very well panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the moodbr br and whats with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother
