oh my god this was so bad the story was weak  at best  and the animation was flat and lifeless  even childish this film takes itself far too seriouslyunless of course they meant to be funny i saw this last week at the london scifi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene i think my favourite was shouldnt you be studying medicine at oopsalof and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalos only line we will be togetherit is our destiny im sorry but after the first time the words lost all meaningbr br and what was with the applebr br i recommend this as a lesson to americans you cannot animate so please dont try you only embarrass yourselves
