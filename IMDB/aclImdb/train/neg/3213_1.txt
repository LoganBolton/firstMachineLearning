well i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course the story line was fallible and laughable the characters were onedimensional the realism was out the window and the animation was done by fouryear olds does that cover it i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observationbr br to begin the story moved too quickly for someone new to this character and situations i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them there was nothing set aside for lady death in a few short scenes we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell this was hard for me to swallow considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father suddenly she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years this was absurd the presentation of lady death was poor to say the least i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind for me it just didnt work she was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator oh i felt sick just watching her the same goes for the character of cremator who was this random person the explanation they gave wasnt enough and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action especially in an animated featurebr br next there was lucifer himself let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive he was weak his voice was laughable and he just didnt represent the image that i had in my mind it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies he was not the ruler of hell but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live speaking of living or dying how can you die again in hell that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation most of the characters were worrying about dying when they didnt even consider the option that they were already dead that is how they got to hell i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me i didnt quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell but that could just be me Â… or maybe it was because there was no development in this story there was nothing built just preparingbr br the battle sequences were hysterically bad the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn why are we america so behind on animation it is huge in asia and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination we are cheap and this film shows itbr br overall this film was bad the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card the production was horrendous as well as the story nothing was developed leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into the strength of the characters was missing and nothing was explained i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come you dont find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbagebr br blah br br grade  out of
