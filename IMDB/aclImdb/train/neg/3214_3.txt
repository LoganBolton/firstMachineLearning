first of all id like to tell you that im into comics anime animation and such stuff it is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie ill be objective to begin with the story  its ok follows the story line of the comic books as far as im familiar with them but the animation well its not actually terrible but its definitely cheap and mediocre it would be a lot better if they didnt try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985 take a look at heavy metal fakk 2000 for instance  4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special so all in all  it lacks atmosphere i watched it but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it it just does not capture you theres plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time is there anyone around but i dont think this is the audience for this movie so they could add a little nudity and spice to it the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have lady death herself there are few sexy looks but thats not enough instead of bill browns music i think it would look better on a hard rock  heavy metal soundtrack all in all  the movie isnt that bad but if you want something better take the original heavy metal heavy metal fakk 2000 ralph bakshis fire and ice or wizards maybe and of course  vampire hunter d bloodlust
