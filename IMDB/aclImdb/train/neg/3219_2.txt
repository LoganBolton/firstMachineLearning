somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for casablanca didnt he or didnt he maybe theres more than one koch slinking around in hollywood and im not too fond of casablanca anyway wait a minute  yes there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood thats the one who wrote casablanca no matter ill put as much care into this comment as howard w koch put into this production which is to say only a littlebr br you know what this sounds like somebody read cliffs notes on shakespeares king lear and decided since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy endingbr br there are differences lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so asks them how much they love him two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear but in the play lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating kids can do that to you take my kid for instance after all the effort i squandered on raising him does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer no in the end everybody in the play diesbr br in the movie evidently the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself somebody jumps in and saves her so the ending is more or less happy thats the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself
