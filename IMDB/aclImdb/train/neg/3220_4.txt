i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end after youve already invested an hour into it and thats what happened with this film i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story i havent gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film endsfortunately i didnt pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting the wife in particular was so perfectbut milo oshea as a jew now that was funny i havent researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 34 of the way through the film before that point a story and characters were developingthere were a number of neat plot points and there wasnt too much time wasted but ooh that last 12 hour if that wasnt the screwiest most worthless denouement ive ever witnessed i dont know what is i just hate it when ones faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence
