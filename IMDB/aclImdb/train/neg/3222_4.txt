i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story this is basically a story of possible redemption racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrustbr br a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife if morris mishkin zero mostel will only believe in the angel belafonte his wife fanny ida kaminska will recover the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angelbr br when he believes it fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morrisbr br jan kadar who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966s the shop on main street directs this film as well kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesnt convey the desperate situation that she faces she keeps calling for ruthie their daughter who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion for most of the film she does not realize the angels appearance in her apartmentbr br the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angels girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment is memorable but all too briefbr br we dont know why belafonte is in danger and why he has diedbr br those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation
