children love dinosaurs its somewhat part of their culture but theyve got the land before time the original at least that movie had heart this this movie is just plain pathetic just because kids love dinosaurs doesnt mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children this movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and its more by the numbers stuff not as soul sucking as theodore rex but its lightyears away from being a land before time
