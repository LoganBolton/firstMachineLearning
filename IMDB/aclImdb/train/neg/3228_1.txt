ive seen other guinea pig films like mermaid in a manhole  he never dies and while theyre pretty sick they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark devils experiment though is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and theres no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever it isnt remotely scary except for perhaps the mindset but its definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment now im not the paragon of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze but this was too much for me really im all for disturbing in fact i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible but this was a bit much the young woman is kicked beaten submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere if you think that sounds great go for it but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff 1 out of 10 absolutely nauseating
