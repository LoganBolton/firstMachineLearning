this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time after having just viewed it i can say it does not live up to those claimsbr br the idea of the movie is indeed demented but overall the execution wasnt at all cringe worthy even the final scene the eyeball thing isnt really that nasty i was expecting something insane instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent shtbr br any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed since there is no story whatsoever though surely most people know this gore fans will be disappointed since contrary to belief the blood and guts here are few and far between not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in historybr br regardless of what people say this movie isnt that shocking it just plain all out sucks avoid it
