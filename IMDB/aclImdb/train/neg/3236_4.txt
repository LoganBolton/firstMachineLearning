i recently watched the first guinea pig film the devils experiment and i must admit to being disappointedbr br this film is invariably included in any list of the nastiest films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype the truth is though i dont rate itbr br if id been watching it believing the opening text to be true i found this tape i might have been a bit disturbed by it thinking it was real even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though i think id have worked out that it indeed wasntbr br throughout the film the girls reactions to what is being done to her just arent what they should be she should be screaming like a banshee in pain the fact that she isnt means that its obviously not real i wouldnt want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting the film would be more disturbingbr br and then there are the notorious scenes nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand the hot oil maggots and innards just didnt bother me im not saying im hard just that i wasnt able to suspend my disbelief partly because of the girls inactionbr br the scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber and the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more i didnt want to look away and neither did i feel nauseousbr br perhaps its because the film is twentyodd years old or perhaps im just jaded the truth is i didnt find this film at all disturbingbr br its the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters story etc and just leaving the torture it works on some levels as a disturbing piece of film though it didnt work for me at leastbr br i watched guinea pig with my wife who is of the its just a film bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film she said that she didnt think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that i played her the fire extinguisher scene from irreversible and she was indeed disturbedbr br im not sure i have a point other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a nonhorror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb
