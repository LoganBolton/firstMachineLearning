not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath and what i get is one bloody scene the eyeball at the tail end of asinine fake slapping and spinning in a desk chair i end up thinking well thats 43 minutes of my life gone forever i wouldnt considers this or flower of flesh and blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch the devils experiment did not it was at best stupid and at worstwellreally stupid perhaps my expectation were too high i put the dvd thinking oh man this is gonna be sick after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times i was watching it in fast forwardbr br two kinds of people would be interested in this film 1 people who seek out fd up films just to see how fd up it really is or 2 horror completest i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason but even if i fell into the category of the former this film wouldnt float my boat as a matter of fact i could imagine this film increasing ones blood lustas in would you just kill the btch already so in conclusion the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes if you want carnage that traditional horror doesnt provide get traces of death sure that sucks too but at least youll get the blood and guts you expectbr br the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel theyre supposed to no artistic merit that i can comprehend no reason for its notoriety no nothing just a lame attempt to be shocking
