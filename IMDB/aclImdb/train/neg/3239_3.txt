ah the infamous guinea pig seriesi honestly have to say that ive been disappointed as a whole by this entire series he never diesmermaid in a manhole and flower of flesh and blood being the exceptionsand even those arent great by any means but devils experiment just plain blows there is nothing realisticlooking going on here other than the climactic or perhaps anticlimactic depending on how you view it eyeball piercing scene the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to hideous more often sometimes hilarious tortures flower of flesh and blood is a more violent and gory depiction of fake snuff material but that film also falls flat on the realism level i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries and theyve really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme filmmaking but devils experiment just doesnt hold up worth a look if you are a diehard if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about but i can only give this film an extremely generous 310 and thats only for the needlethroughtheeye scene
