this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest in my opinion a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her and at this point i will say that these films are not real they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possiblebr br the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases for example when they kick the girl in the floor we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl and how stupid this looks the sound effects are also unrealistic and dont make sense other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours the ripping off of fingernails worms placed on the wounds in the girls body the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig although it is not as bloody as the next part flowers of flesh and blood which tries to be as shocking as possiblebr br guinea pig devils experiment is perhaps the sickest thing ive seen and the closest thing to snuff there is this is still of course faked sntuff the only difference to genuine snuff film is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so sy and repulsive they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it i watched this as a curiosity as the other parts in the series and now i know how insignificant trash these are they work only in shock level and thats not too valuable cinematic achievement devils experiment is perhaps the sickest film ive seen and mermaid in a manhole guinea pig 4 is perhaps the most disgusting film ive seen so these are pretty extreme in my book but thats all they are
