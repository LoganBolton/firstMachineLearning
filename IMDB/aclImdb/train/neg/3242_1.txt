heres a review for people like me this movie sucks from beginning to end i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000 the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart the lead falls for a con man and it doesnt occur to her that she might get conned and shes rich and shes a famous psychologist come on people she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even halfwitted movie viewers rain man would have been insulted i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meateaters warstarters and furwearers my hatred is so complete that it defies logic but ill give it a shot that its not supposed to sound real is fine i dont care its that everyone talks the same mamet cant create characters all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors no wonder his actors are so wooden theyre confused about everyone being the same character however his later films do improve
