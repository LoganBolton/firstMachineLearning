david mamets film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinkingmans movie a movie that makes you question everybody and everything i saw it for the first time recently and couldnt understand what was supposed to be so great about itbr br the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a bestselling author margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patients gambling debt to a shark named mike played by joe mantegna who is the only reason to watch this film she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her intrigued she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set upbr br i dont feel like going into details but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of 80000br br first of all the big twist towards the end was very predictable any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads not only that but the audience and the main character knows that theyre dealing with con men so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned besides margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily  and keep in mind she knows full well that mike is a con artistbr br secondly we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning yet in order for the con to ultimately work she had to do several things that the con men couldnt possibly have predicted that she would do first she had to decide to help settle her patients debt allowing her to meet the con men in the first place if she hadnt done this the entire con would have failed i just have to say that its pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patients gambling debt not only that but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up did they simply show up at that bar every night hoping she would come and see them another thing that had to happen that couldnt have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade what are the odds of this happening and yet the whole con is based on this premisebr br another problem i had is with the ending margaret finds out shes been conned and decides to get revenge on mike at first mamet leads us to believe that shes going to con the con but that falls through so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade not only that but she didnt even take back the money he stole from herbr br ultimately the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled and if you like me predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying
