i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me as a huge fan i was sure hed be supremely in his element with such a promising premise and what could go wrong yesterday my bubble got burst bigtime boys and girls because i saw the movie br br the first act where its set up that he hates his life hes a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god is serviceable the second act where hes summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty is great  carrey gets to have fun with his new toys and its a pleasure to watch really funny but the third act is wretched beyond beliefbr br the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace jennifer aniston who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device even her name reeks of unsubtlety  she thinks hes gonna pop the question but instead he tells her on bended knee yet that hes finally getting his news anchor job and isnt it so excitingbr br she doesnt think so she wants him to marry her see so she winds up leaving him see even though she still loves him very much see and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic beyondheavyhanded spiritualsounding cliche after the next until by the end i was praying too  for it to be over br br i didnt mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts one example  in the 2nd act after he gets his powers bruce prances into the room singing what if god were one of us just a slob like one of us blah blah blah and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us for openers morgan freeman  aka god  tells bruce he cant violate anyones free will but he does this a lot those choices were forgivable  this is a jim carrey comedy directed by tom shadyac  it aint the remains of the day br br or rather it was supposed to be a comedy when the script writers lose track of that in the dreaded act 3 and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of gag message movie what we get instead is hell on earth bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways he realizes that grace is his saving  have to say it  grace and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavyhanded way however the film didnt have to go into the dumper to make these points unfortunately the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever lighthanded way so they went the bangemovertheheads route in hopes that we wouldnt notice they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny outtakes at the end in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste it didnt work for me
