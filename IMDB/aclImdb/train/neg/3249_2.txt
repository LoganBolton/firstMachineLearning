jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy and we love him for it he has the ability to make mediocre comedies ala ace ventura and turn them into decent comedic outings or in the case of liar liar make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas he was excellent in both man on the moon and the truman show the guy is remarkablebr br then comes bruce almighty an ideal vehicle for carrey and a premise that should have worked carrey after complaining about god and how his life stinks is enabled with gods powers however the script is pure recycled garbage now no matter how bad a script is carreys improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects only some of which are amusing carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless he seems more like a 5year yearning for our attention wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny when its really just annoyingbr br i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on friends and she was superb in last years the good girl she too has a gift for comedy but with the script as linear as it is she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend she comes across as nagging grumpy and there is no chemistry between the two starsbr br bruce almighty should have been a comedy that works but it doesnt even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that its making fun of religion a few minor giggles his internet is yehweh but instead its just turned into a comedic superpower comedy not to mention that its tone shifts from silly to heavyhanded and even black comedy at times the movie fails on nearly every level thats not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs but its close any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get its laughs has problems but hey if you find pee jokes funny go for itbr br
