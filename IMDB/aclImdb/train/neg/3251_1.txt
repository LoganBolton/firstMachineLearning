i caught this movie on fx last night and as i was sitting there watching it it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever bad acting bad cinematography bad sound totally unbelievable fight sequences stupid characters all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie ive ever seen it was so bad i was enthralled by its sheer lack of anything semicompetent that i had to keep watching and they made a sequel
