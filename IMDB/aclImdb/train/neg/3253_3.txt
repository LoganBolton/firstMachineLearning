i actually saw china obrien ii before i ever saw the original china obrien and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse but worse  funnier and funnier  better if youre a bad movie fan like i am this is great material if however you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot acting ability or moviemaking skill this is best avoided the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fastforward hilariously bad see it for a laugh see it for mindless entertainment but whatever you do see it for free on tv
