i dug this out and watched it tonight i honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time i saw it i remember it being a seriously flawed film i dont remember it being this badbr br i am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly who am i to blame for this the 2 guys who wrote and i use that word loosely the script the casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story only 2 of them are among the amazing 5 the director who clearly refused to take it seriously and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing  bad acting everywhere i liked the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film don black who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that musicbr br it figures that i should pull this out less than a week after rereading the comicbook adaptation the first 1520 minutes of the film moreorless really less parallel the first issue of the comic as i watched it tonight i kept wondering why was almost every single detail changed doc showing up then using his wristwatch remotecontrol to open the safe and the snipers bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass were just about the only things left the same i mean if youre gonna do an adaptation why in gods name change everythingbr br once they leave docs hq virtually nothing is as it was in the comic which given roy thomas i figure probably follows the book i read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie again why ive heard it was changed because they werent able to secure the kind of budget they wanted i look at the film and think lack of money in no way explains what i saw on the screenbr br you know when people complain about joel schumacher they should really take a look at this thing the best thing i can say is i think it would make a great doublefeature with the 1966 batman feature and probably a great triplebill with that and the 1980 flash gordon all 3 films are silly maybe we can blame the 1966 film and tv series for this some fans have complained over the years that adam wests batman ruined the image of comicbooks in the minds of generations of noncomics fans i think the same could be said for hollywood im reminded of how many really really bad films based on classic characters have been made over the years especially it seems to me in the late 70s  early 80s charlie chan fu manchu tarzan buck rogers flash gordon the lone ranger all murdered by hollywood types who think oh comicbooks so you know its supposed to be stupid more like theyre the stupid ones what a waste of potentialbr br let me say some good things despite the script and the directing ron ely is great when i read a doc savage story i dont think of the james bama paintings i think of ely bill lucking who later was a regular on the ateam is terrific eldon quick who ive seen somewhere else but cant recall where is terrific paul gleason who i absolutely hated with a passion and a vengeance in the breakfast club teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere may be the best of the amazing 5 in the film pamela hensley though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story is terrific before she let her hair down i also realized she looked a hell of a lot like ardala valmar from those awful john calkins buck rogers strips i just read the other day shes got a big nose like ardala only not quite as pronounced the comics ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie princess aura or cher or maybe streisand take yer pick ardala actually got plastic surgery in the george tuska strips after she was stunningbr br paul wexler funny enough i saw just last week in a get smart episode i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing i dont know because that character sure wasnt in the movie the film takes its title from
