having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton on the strength of class movies like sling blade a simple plan and the man who wasnt there amongst others it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didnt realise however was that there could be one this bad ill give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is  the funniest dialogue in it goes like this knock knock whos there the big stinking man the big stinking man who the big stinking man  is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes i guess he needed the work at that time in his career and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though although its undeniably awful i dont hate it thats probably because i save my ire for any high budget special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a nobudget flick like this one 210 at a push
