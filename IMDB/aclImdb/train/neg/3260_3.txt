doc savage the man of bronze is a horrible movie poorly scripted overacted and just plain silly that being said it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer its one of those movies like santa claus conquers the martians or yor the hunter from the future so bad it is almost good if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch its campy its fun it has a theme by sousa if youre looking for a good movie though look elsewhere 310br br btw ive heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake
