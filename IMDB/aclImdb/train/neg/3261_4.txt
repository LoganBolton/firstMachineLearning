after watergate vietnam and the dark days of the nixon and jimmy carter eras what the world needed was a good oldfashioned chapterplay hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the america of 1936 or the jungles of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures unfortunately what it got in 1975 was doc savage the man of bronze perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george pals final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robesons pulppaperback novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other we can do better than that and adding a bullwhip a battered fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mixbr br a big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman  explorer adventurer philanthropist a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleachblonde bulletproof musclebound body of a greek god or rather the form of tvs tarzan ron ely a rather dull charlton heston clone here theres simply nothing he cant do and more damagingly nothing that can harm him the man is the virtual incarnation of hitlers aryan ubermensch no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany albeit with allamerican values and just in case there should ever be anything hes overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage the less than fabulous five a chemist an electrician and even an archaeologist i can accept and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures in reality docs brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even kryptonite wouldnt put a dent in him  there needed to be someone at risk in the stories though with the exception of paul gleason theyre all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film youd happily kill them all off during the opening titles the villains fare no better with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas scott walker no a different one delivering one of cinemas worst accents is it meant to be scottish irish welsh greek pakistani or some nationality noone has ever heard of while robyn hiltons marilyn monroeish dumb blonde moll gives paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakesbr br even with those drawbacks this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes a pool of gold a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why docs father was murdered unfortunately its a question of tone in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes werent brooding figures prone to stateoftheart action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of lowbudget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought the films aimed purely at the matinée market you know for kids there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straightfaced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in postproduction be it the colgate twinkle in docs eye the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dustup with captain seas or don blacks gungho lyrics to john philip sousas patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with after all its hard to see how one of the villains underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while docs explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam wests batman instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as doc displaying his sixth sense by er bobbing his adams applebr br perhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on thembr br still aside from docs various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously la standing in for new york while fred koenekamps cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget and its good to see a superhero movie that doesnt spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himselfbr br its a film id really like to like more but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities no wonder doc savage the arch enemy of evil the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits never happened
