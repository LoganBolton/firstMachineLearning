this is the second british rank film to adapt the stories of sommerset maugham to film all but one story from quartet does not travel well into the contempory era and the actors speech is decidedly clipped as only british pre1950s actors delivery can be in anycase trio seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptationbr br one of the problems these two films cant overcome is that their source material was written 2530 years prior to the films consequently by the 1950s maughms prewar popularist small morality storyteling seemed rather quaint if not downright coy
