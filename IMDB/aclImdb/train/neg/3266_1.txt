when ben red foxx discovers his wife beatrice pearl bailey has run off with his own brother he rushes to his son norman michael warren to unload his tale of woeonly to discover that norman has a secret lover the effeminate garson dennis dugan needless to say ben does not take it well and numerous complications followincluding bens attempt to get norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker tammy dobson unfortunately this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itselfbr br originally written for the theatre by ron clark and sam bobrick norman is that you was an absolute disaster on the new york stage to give the play its due i actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre productionand while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce the cast played so broadly and in such dropdead manner that it proved quite amusing it is a pity the cast of this film didnt do the samebr br this is an atrociously performed motion picture red foxx one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century is about as funny here as yesterdays wash michael warren who later appeared on the television series hill street blues to much better effect competes with foxx to see who can give the worst performance and pearl bailey is not far behind truth be told only dennis duggan tammy dobson and a cameo by wayland flowers have any sparkand sadly that is only in comparison with the rest of the castbr br not only is the film badly performed it looks bad according to film lore this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposesand believe me it shows the film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of norman and garsons apartmentbr br some films are so bad that they become funny but norman is that you isnt one of them i can sum up my reaction to this film in two words miss it dont buy it dont rent it dont touch it with a ten foot pole just back away slowly and then run like hellbr br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
