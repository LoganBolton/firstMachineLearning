theres nothing amazing about the amazing mr williams part of this movies problem is its lead actor melvyn douglas he was a lousy actor and lazy with it for most of his career he allowed his good looks a glib manner and usually but not in this movie some fine scriptwriting to make up for his lack of acting ability i disliked douglas as an actor before i knew anything about him as a person ive learnt enough about him to know that i also despise his politics ill give melvyn douglas credit for one thing his chromosomes did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress illeana douglasbr br melvyn douglas made this movie right after the brilliant ninotchka  talk about a comedown the amazing mr williams is allegedly a comedy but i never laughed douglas plays a plainclothes detective on the homicide squad named kenny williams i never heard of a police detective named kenny but if they called him kenneth williams  well what a carryon the whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about killing women no motive is given for this he just likes to kill women the mayor jonathan hale better than usual calls williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killerbr br spoilers approaching the cheap vulgar untalented and unattractive joan blondell plays the mayors secretary she doesnt sound literate enough to file a letter much less type one blondell and douglas squabble like a cat and a dog so its blatantly obvious theyre going to end up togetherbr br at this movies lowest point melvyn douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman you do not want to see melvyn douglas in drag hes well over six foot and he doesnt even shave off that annoying moustache the similarlytashed william powell was an actor very similar in type to melvyn douglas but much more talented when powell disguised himself as a woman in love crazy he had the integrity to shave off his moustache a genuine sacrifice as powell needed it to grow in again for his next role but melvyn douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie not even a razor he plays his drag scenes with the same annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his careerbr br on the plus side the amazing mr williams has several of those splendid supporting players who made hollywoods movies of the 30s so delightful edward brophy is brilliant here touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely furlough from his life sentence the dyspeptic donald macbride is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer and is nearly lynched by a mob ruth donnelly is splendid as usual for her but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual orbit on the warner brothers backlot jimmy conlin luis alberni and the grinning dave willock are all fine in small roles barbara pepper whom i usually dislike is good here too the grossly unpleasant maude eburne gets some screen time i always loathe her and she gives the same performance in every film  but some audiences enjoy eburnes onenote performance very much for reasons i cant fathombr br if youre familiar with hollywood character actors of the 1930s and the roles they tended to play one glance at imdbs cast list will tell you who the murderer is thats the problem with the amazing mr wiliams everything is too obvious ill rate this movie 2 points out of 10
