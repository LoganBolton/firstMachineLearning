ill say one thing about this film there are no lulls you cant get bored watching this the problem is that it is too intense there is too much action and it needs lulls that is the risk you take in modern action films you want it interesting but not overdone this is way overdonebr br even though the acting is fine and features a couple of names in gary busey and roy scheider it still has the feel of a b film the best part of it is scheiders dialog the only a part of this b filmbr br the rest of the story is strictly rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes one in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines that was memorable not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long
