oh geez there are so many other films i want to see out there i got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted  yeahbr br i used to watch this show when i was in collegeit was mindless kinda fun and somewhat actionoriented the show had a good heart thoand the characters were cute no one ever got killed or even hurt badly it was like a cartoon come to life cut to 2005what happened this one doesnt work as others have said there simply isnt a cohesive story and the performances are weirdalmost annoying  definitely not faithful to the original charactersthe whole thing is a like a mad tv skit and it lasts over 100 minutes this was one of the few times ive been embarrassed watching a film what were they thinking as best i can tell mustve been for the product marketing toys etc all i can say is let this one die a quick death it makes the original dukes of hazzard seem like masterpiece theaterbr br i think the only remake left to do from tv is gilligans island good luck
