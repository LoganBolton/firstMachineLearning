even if youre a huge sandler fan please dont bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for 799 assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked judging by the rrating and scantilyclad women on the cover well there are quite a few scantilyclad women but none get naked im not sure what point this was in sandlers career but im guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol timesbut we the audience are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is nobudget movie thats right not a lowbudget movie a nobudget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot its like an extended sketch comedy showbut a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor im not even going to try to make any logic here sure sandlers current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in billy madison the midget in happy gilmores happy place but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if youre curious about adams early days in filmyou still wont be interested youre better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance billy zane titanic has a supporting role and the great burt young from the rocky movies has a significant role br br this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99cent rental section of your local video storeand rightfully so br br my score 3 out of 10
