i had suspicions the movie was going to be bad im a dukes fan from way back have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good but to sum it up the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv showbr br jessica simpson was pathetic while i can honestly say that the original daisys outfits were just as revealing jessica simpsons interpretation of daisy was simply awful sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their graves as wellbr br dont waste your money if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed
