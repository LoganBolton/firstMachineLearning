have i seen a worse movie perhaps only manos the hands of fate dragged more than dukes i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point lets touch on a fewbr br there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they dont respond he shrugs and moves on since neither the knoxville or scott know what hes talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was restartedbr br the few times the general lee flew through the air werent even that exciting nothing i havent seen on the tv seriesbr br very little chemistry between knoxville and scott the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly the rest of the time it seems distant and forcedbr br seann william scotts awful horrendous accent or lack thereofbr br i hated willie nelsons performance were bad jokes supposed to be endearing i wanted him to disappearbr br jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film thats telling you how horrible this movie is shes a goddessbr br during the climax of the film i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county starting with willie nelson and his accomplices a nuclear bomb would have sufficedbr br this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming filmbr br if only we could erase and start over
