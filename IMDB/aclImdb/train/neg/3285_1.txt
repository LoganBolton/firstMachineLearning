when a movie like the dukes of hazzard brings in over 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe im just not realizing how many people this kind of noeffort trash will appeal tobr br hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen this is that i walked out despite getting a free movie pass the dialogue could not be dumber the stunts could not be more overthetop and outrageous perhaps this bigger that big image appeals to texans but it didnt appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater none of the big names were in this careerending flick except for burt reynolds which says all you need to hear jessica simpson  dont make me laughbr br i wouldnt even recommend this film for video even if you were desperate this was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing they did despite the public being forewarned stupidity abound
