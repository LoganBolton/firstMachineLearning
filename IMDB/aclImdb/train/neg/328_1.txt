i am a huge adam sandler fan and one day i was looking at the castcrew selection on one of his dvds and saw going overboard and decided to go out and rent it so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didnt hit puberty yet he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out i couldnt even watch 30 minutes of this crap i didnt laugh chuckle or even smirk at this movie actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movieand it didnt work once although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this moviebecause it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever madeever
