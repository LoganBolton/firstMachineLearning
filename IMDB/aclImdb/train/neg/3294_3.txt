in hazzard county georgia cousins bo and luke duke scott knoxville and their cousin daisy duke jessica simpson run moonshine made by their uncle jesse willie nelson while avoiding the local authority boss hog burt reynolds their problems with the boss are only beginning as they learn hes been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below itbr br i have never seen the tv show and after watching the movie im not going to start any time soon i like stupid comedies but this one didnt offer many laughs it was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through the second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity the film focused on bo and luke way too much the characters in general werent very interesting and the actors portraying them didnt do a very good jobbr br the acting wasnt very good i wasnt expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny seann william scott and johnny knoxville both give below average performances the latter was pretty good as stifler but he tries way too hard here the latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else jessica simpson isnt known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing shes famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things she is pretty but shes a weak actor it doesnt matter though because she doesnt really appear in the movie and the character she plays isnt complex or anything willie nelson also has a minor role and he doesnt do anything specialbr br the screenplay was written by john obrien and he made two films prior to the dukes of hazzard the first one was cradle to the grave which was okay the second one was starsky and hutch which was pretty funny he doesnt do a good job here though as the story is a mess he also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better the movie is also pretty long for a comedy okay 106 minutes isnt exactly long but it feels so much longer because theres very little humor in the first hour i think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time the dukes of hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes the car sequences were average and they dont save an already troubled film in the end dukes of hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and its better if you just skip it rating 410
