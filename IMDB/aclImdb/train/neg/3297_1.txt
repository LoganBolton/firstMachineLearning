why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it they ask why hollywood isnt making the money it used to because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay 10 to see their garbage the tv show was what it was good people in bad situations where the good il boys come out on top it wasnt gone with the wind but it was fun this movie is garbage hollywood cant come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some  i only hope that this movie makes 10xs less than it cost to make the only ones to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the general lee the audience is the victimbr br dont see it watch the reruns of the tv show instead they still hold up 20 years later
