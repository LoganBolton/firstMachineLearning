when i heard that the dukes of hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script i was like alright ill give it a chance its not going to be better than the first but well see what happens well i saw what happened i saw a great late 70s80s show that was a classic basically humiliated by hollywood its so sad to see that hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days they are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience and try to remake the classic show heads up hollywood it aint workin anyway more about the show i think they could have casted a better actor than sean william scott stiffler from american pie to play bo im sure that john schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of also get for real johnny knoxville as luke duke how low can you go a crappy jackass actor to play lovable luke this sickens me also ill give jessica simpson is a beautiful woman but her acting sucks catherine bach who played the original daisy was smart sexy strong opinionated and a good il southern girl she was every little girls role model growing up i owned the doll and the jeep  thank you very much anyway jessica simpson played a smart ass 2bit slut as daisy duke daisy never was blonde why did they have to cast her jessica alba would have played a great daisy duke she can speak with a great southern accent and she is gorgeous and would have done a wonderful job anyway id like to say that this movie blew something fierce i feel like i got ripped off by paying 850 for tickets and they should refund my money if you like the dukes of hazzard the original series dont see this movie itll just upset you cmt country music television plays the reruns of the dukes all the time later at night so set your tivos and go with the real thing not the imitation on the big screen in hollywood
