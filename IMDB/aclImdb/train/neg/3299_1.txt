this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen i was actually expecting a bad movie but i was caught by surprise believe it or not the storyline is the traditional all clichées are includedbr br the dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise halfdescent actors are trying to make it sound real the photo is not too good the music is so malplacée it actually made me angry the actors are not even trying altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the action itselfbr br i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming who is financing this shit where is the screening  and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible scriptbr br there are a million hollywoodmovies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparisonbr br i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all i feel robbed of 2 hours of my life
