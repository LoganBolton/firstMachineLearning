first i bought it at the video store second i watched it third it was boring fourth it was not funny fifth most of the antics were lame and last but not least its not only a bad movie its a total fiascobr br i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film i pity it because it was his first movie even if you are a huge adam sandler fan dont bother watching this movie instead just take the video board a yacht and throw it overboard
