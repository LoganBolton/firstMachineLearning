sometime in 1998 saban had acquired the rights to produce a brandnew ninja turtles liveaction series naturally being a fan of the tmnt back in the day this obviously peaked my interest so when i started watching the show to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement some time later more like recently i got a chance to revisit the seriesbr br first off lets talk about some of the positives they managed to recreate the turtles lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot and the turtle suits while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the seriesbr br people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain and besides most fans dont realize or dont remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic the shredder was offed in the very first issue never mind the countless resurrections that would follow so on a personal standpoint i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorablebr br unfortunately they end up replacing him with these original villains who as stated seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show and with these new magicwielding generics comes a new female magicwielding turtle the infamous venus de milo ill be honest i never got comfortable with her im not against the idea of a female turtle im just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her makebelieve enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released fortunately they all share the spotlight togetherbr br next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it given time and maybe another season i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness but while the idea was sound the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series as it stands next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten
