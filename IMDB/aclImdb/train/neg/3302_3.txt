swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate american hardened action movies like heat but with a low budget this movie follows the same prescription as noll tolerans and livvakterna however it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough moviebr br the story has been seen before the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor especially from the main actress the movie tries to paint a picture of hardboiled militarylike robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational it does not succeed very wellbr br the bluishcast photo style does not seem fresh anymore and it is not even done well in this picture only a very few scenes actually look good also the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterwardbr br the main quality of this movie is stefan sauk though not making a convincing portrait of a swatteam leader has some really funny lines also the music is quite well
