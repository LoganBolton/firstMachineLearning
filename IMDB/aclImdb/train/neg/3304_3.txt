greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganjagrowing in order to pay the bills it sounds promising and the everreliable brenda blethyn doesnt disappoint but the material is sitcomthin theres actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to give me one a toke and he thinks shes asking for sex and acts all awkward yes its humour so twee a nun would be bored saving grace doesnt seem to know what it wants to be the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryans daughter whilst the lighthearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow it does speed up after the first hour but by then its too clich√©d to care the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina ive ever seen
