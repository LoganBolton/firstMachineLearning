i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film the humor seems to be destined for corpses its slow the story is too simple to be true the characters do not raise much sympathy a few nonimportant characters aside nothing surprising happens what did the writers of this script think oooo funny lets make some old ladys high on pot lets make them giggle lets make them behave like little children oooo yes thats absolutely brilliant and originalbr br this film has irritated me most from all the films ive seen in the last five years
