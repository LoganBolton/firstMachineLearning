bah another tired desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmedbr br on the plus side toni collette is superb as always being an actual actress you see and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes there are even a few genuinely funny lines and the filmwork score and editing is competent apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusionbr br but ah but much of the cast seems to be on autopilot and they are almost all very clearly too old and in one case too young for their declared ages worse they are all speaking austinese that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldnt be further from the way people actually spoke in austens day think yosemite sam i kid you not this is particularly sad considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial fakespearan that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungsbr br and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow shes only ever played one character in her films and she stays true to form here running through her entire range smirking to sulking in the first ten minutes then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apartbr br in short there is very little reason to watch emma its an amiable enough adaptation but if youre going to pack a film full of anacronisms ie an appalingly thin lead who cant shoot a bow or handle a period accent then you might as well do it properly as with the vastly superior clueless
