this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still cant bring myself to forgive this movies existencebr br my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them ive always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupidbr br my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if youre a ewan mcgregor fan believe me by skipping this film you havent missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut
