i like jane austin novels i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies and im half way through mansfield park but i couldnt stand emma i gave up on the book after 2 chapters and by the end of the movie i couldnt care less about emma she didnt seem to change at all maybe it was paltrows acting which as excellent in se7en or my lack of interest for the movie dunno br br the costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer ehlebr br i gave it a 2 basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor i liked his singing
