how good is gwyneth paltrow this is the right movie for her too bad shes completely out role i havent read the book by jane austen but i cant believe it is so superficial and the characters arent much more than caricatures it wasnt probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didnt overstep the mark of overacting a couple of times
