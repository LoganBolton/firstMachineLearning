i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen cujo adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner thats the plotbr br  thats it nothing else in the film makes sense its all over the place like a mad mans breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating throw both shoes at the tv kind of way even general noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasnt for humour add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent ive ever heared and you have something which i wont call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesnt even fit the basic definition of a film i highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing youll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasnt as bad as going overboard
