i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seenbr br first of all the pace is incredibly slow so it seems much longer than it is and its not shortim sure when jane austen wrote the book she made it several pages long filled it with description and didnt intend for people to read in in one day or it might drag and lose its appeal which emma most certainly did now sense and sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace but at least it had lively lines to make up for it as well as some good performancesbr br that brings me to flaw 2 which is of course the acting while i dont happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film i am sure they are capable of good work but i didnt see much of it in this movie it was like people were trying too hard to be witty too hard to be upperclass too hard to be british well some of them so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as peoplebr br 3 the cast as i said seemed only like actors and not actually like the people they were playing maybe thats a good thing because the people they played really werent all that nice why did everybody like emma for example sure she was nice to the rich handsome people in front of them but she was an awful gossip behind their backs if her friends were ugly then she didnt even bother to go behind their backs so why is this girl so great why do people have to tell stories just to make her laugh of course the snob couldnt even do that right i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow and her emma did not exactly change my opinionbr br well its easy to see that i did not care for this one im sure its a lovely book and all but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen and emma is one of them
