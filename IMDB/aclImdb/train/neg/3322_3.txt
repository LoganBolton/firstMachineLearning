unfortunately for me the first busby berkeley movie i ever watched was 42nd street i then expected all of his stuff to be that good i found out that wasnt necessarily the case even here with my alltime favorite classicera actor james cagneybr br oh the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome they seem to always involve screaming unhappy show producers in this film its cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thinfastbr br even the songs in here are anywhere near 42nd street class songs you could hum for years and years  decades i should say the songs in this movie are not memorable no this is one of the few early cagney films  and berkeley films  i totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching
