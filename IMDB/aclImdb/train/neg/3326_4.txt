dr hackenstein begins at the turn of last century 1909 the dawn of modern medical science to be exact dr eliot hackenstein david muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments dr hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life its now three years later  dean slesinger micheal ensign is round the docs house for dinner as dean slesinger  dr hackenstein eat they talk about hackenstiens experiments which dean slesinger has always been opposed to dr hackenstein shows dean slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila sylvia lee baker who died in an unfortunate accident  can telepathically talk to him christy botkin provides sheilas voice apparently dr hackenstein also shows dean slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage  explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life the dean has some sort of seizure  apparently dies meanwhile sisters wendy bambi darro as dyanne dirossario  leslie trilling catherine davis cox plus their brother alex john alexis  their cousin melanie victor stacey travis are driving along near hackensteins house when they crash they seek shelter  assistance  arrive upon hackensteins doorstep dr hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night later on dr hackenstein is visited by two graverobbers xavier logan ramsey  ruby rhodes ann ramsey who deliver a male body when hackenstein actually needs female parts for sheila dr hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available  starts to borrow the bits n pieces he needs to complete sheilabr br written  directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr hackenstein ill state right now that it aint brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during its middle as things settle down the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr hackenstein is trying to restrain melanie  she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper yolanda simpson catherine cahn by kicking out  hackenstein keeping melanie behind yolandas back who is seemingly oblivious to whats happening with a touch of gore but id say dr hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception  feel throughout there are some tacky puns  sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh dr hackenstein to wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example i also thought the scene when mrs trilling phyllis diller reports her missing daughters to the bemused detective olin william schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circles talking about why he isnt looking for them even though he has only just been told why the cell doesnt have a prisoner in it  that if he didnt find the cousin not to worry about it none of its flat laughoutloud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion  found the film as whole to be quietly amusing there isnt a lot of on screen gore a few severed limbs sheilas decapitated head some medical stitching  those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way i liked the characters in dr hackenstein too which was surprise in itself the acting isnt brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it lots of exaggerated facial movements  some serious overacting means its never dull oh  the three birds in dr hackenstein are fit if you know what i mean technically the film is ok as well once again it aint going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting it doesnt always work the clothes are at odds with each other at times the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room  stick a few candles in there it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isnt a bad looking film at all considering could have done without the comedy music though overall i ended up enjoying dr hackenstein much more than i thought i would although that in itself isnt a recommendation its certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made  it certainly is not the worst either a watchable enough piece of harmless fun
