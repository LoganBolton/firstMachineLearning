apparently theres a very good reason why i never heard about dr hackenstein before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance that reason is it sucks its a very pointless dull imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedyparody actually to be honest im not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80s horror effort in the year 1909 at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences dr elliot hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more no less  to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed shes only just a living head left now but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers so when dr hackenstein yells out i need three female bodies to bring back my wife his words arent even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females and one really annoying nerdy kid with car trouble show up at his doorstep why doesnt that ever happen to me i need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem  see nothing anyway the good doctor sees his wish fulfilled but unfortunately  for science that is  he develops sympathy for one of the three girls dr hackenstein is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of reanimator and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic like a severed head talking oneliners its easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere as it doesnt appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre the funniest character is undoubtedly the loudspeaking female grave robber ruby depicted by the anticherubic anne ramsey 80s horror buffs will certainly remember her from wes cravens deadly friend where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball dr hackenstein supposedly takes place in the early 1900s but there are hardly any attempts to recreate the atmosphere of that era except maybe for some automobiles dr hackensteins laboratory is a quite clichéd 80s set piece with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors
