i will start this off by saying i couldnt get all the way through it i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasnt any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who approved this project they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity thats the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam the acting isnt much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos yay who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser thats about as much of the plot as i understoodbr br overall its the worst movie ive ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many coworkers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think id ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes inbr br my response is always well now you canbr br
