this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a fulllength film make poor sid caesar as the vain emperor is made to look so stupid its hard to watch him as the sly tailor robert morse hasnt an ounce of charm neither does his hapless nephew jason carter the songs are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down the direction is practically nonexistent and the supporting characters add very little lysette anthony is pretty as the emperors daughter but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason a fate shared by many of the minor players and the film crawls at a snails pace hans christian andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared it can honestly be said at least of this movie tale its no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion
