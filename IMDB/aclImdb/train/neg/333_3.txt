i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics  and im talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for itbr br it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face  bad guys enter the templebr br child sits with blank expressionbr br bad guys chop up the monksbr br child sits with blank expressionbr br bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with  go on guess  you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jacksons wonderland ranch hed still give the same blank expression  this movie would be better titled the wooden childbr br the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily  obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated  not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening  in fact thats the main problem  and boy its a serious one  with this movie  the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes its like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together  i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too  did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be  its part fantasy  part martial arts  part buddy movie  part comedy and its all crap
