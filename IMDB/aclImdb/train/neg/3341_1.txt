i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren whom i hadnt seen in any movies since rocky iv unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr lundgren who was okayish kata dob√≥ was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and makeupbr br the plot is not at all clever its something thats been repeated a million times in different movies the crooks were utterly stereotypical and lundgrens character hadnt any depth in it i didnt really expect a movie masterpiece but unfortunately this is not even decent action every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of overthetop unrealism and comicbook like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soonbr br i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comiclike action but only if nothing else is availablebr br 110 i guess the current average vote of 70 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie
