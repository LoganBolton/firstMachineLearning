i wasnt expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j furie and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got a oneliner user comment  2nd rate action movie  didnt seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film on the other hand i wouldnt have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 50 but hey the movie had a 59 out of 10 score which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of productionbr br now i understand that the 375 of people who rated this film a 10 excellent was clearly a publicity stunt because detention is the regular nu image garbage you have seen before over and overbr br lundgren does not convince as an exmilitary turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school his acting is just plain terrible emotionless and contrived lundgrens inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids either they are great actors or compared to lundgren they seem great actors  just because they seem natural and believablebr br detention has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie  a closedforweekend highsecurity high school four teens in detention with a warveteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in  but the story something like the breakfast club meets die hard or is it panic room is full of unbelievable situations lots of clichés and stereotypical characters and lets not forget dolph lundgren is the main actorbr br alex karzis and kata dobó play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie even if he seems a lowbudget version of sam rockwell and she a milla jovovich wannabe in a movie where everything fails their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero
