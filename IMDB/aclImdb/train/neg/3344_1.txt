i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the funniest action clich√©s imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite spoiler even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a submachine gun through a high school hallway and the kid wins good game the oscar goes to detention dolph if youre reading this thanks for the laughs old friendbr br in summary terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it hilarious
