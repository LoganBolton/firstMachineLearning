bad movie for sure its such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects a lot of hasty scenes the airport one for example and a real unfunny time charles dance is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in last action hero eddie murphy is doing a noncomic joking and i heard that this sunk had already succeed big time success ill never understand why or how  in one tv interview ive heard eddie murphy himself when he was nominated for an oscar 2007 regretted it in a comic way  br br one of the comments said heyits the 1980s  well no my friend its the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether its the 1980s or the 1950s  br br there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie the first is that ill never forget the long tan fascinating legs of charlotte lewis especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be but how odd  as ive watched her in following movies and she wasnt that beautiful again  anyhow the second reason is that ive found this movies title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies everbr br the bottom line bad movie greeeeeat legs
