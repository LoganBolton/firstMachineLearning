i dont even know where to begin on this one its all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldnt be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie anaconda armageddon after all the man did cowrite bottle rocket and rushmore he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zetajones should become a porn star theres no room in legitimate acting for her im serious one of the worst movies ive ever seen ever
