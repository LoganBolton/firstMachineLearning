its my opinion that when you decide to remake a very good film you should strive to do better than the original or at least give it a fresh point of view now the 1963 robert wise telling of shirley jacksons remarkable novel the haunting of hill house is worth the price of admission even today now fast forward to 1999 and the remake i was left shaking my head and asking why the acting is wooden the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate i had heard that this update was bad but couldnt believe it was that bad considering the source material i was wrong after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was she said well they got your money shes right dont let them get yours if theres no profit in making lousy remakes maybe theyll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesnt insult their audience
