there were only two things that kept me interested in this film i was waiting for owen wilson to die and catherine zeta jonesbr br this was basically a one woman show catherine zeta jones was just there to provide eyecandy liam neeson was totally wasted in this film like jones he had no role at all the film was all lily taylor ransom ready to wear she was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by david self ok it was his first one and he did redeem himself with road to perditionbr br i dont know what director jan de bonts problem was he did a great job with speed and twister he really fell down on the job here maybe he was still recovering from the disaster speed 2 cruise control he should thank his lucky stars for the wild wild west else this would be the worst picture of 1999br br avoid at all costs
