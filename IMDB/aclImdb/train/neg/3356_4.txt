the shirley jackson novel the haunting of hill house is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiecebr br the 1963 chiller the haunting stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent br br and then jan de bont made this in 1999 the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas  if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itselfbr br it starts off averagely as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair retelling and then the first scare comes a loose harpsichord wire slashes a womans face dr marrows assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tearsbr br from then on the film just spirals downwards the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen wilsons character being particularly irritating so its such a relief when hes decapitated by the fluebr br the special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i wont bother listing thembr br so all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please dont buy it whatever you do dont waste your moneybr br final rating 410
