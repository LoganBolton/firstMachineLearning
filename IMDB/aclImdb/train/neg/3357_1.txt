how viewers react to this new adaption of shirley jacksons book which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie true enough will be based i suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this oneand those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of hollywoods current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is are going to love itbr br things i did not like about this adaptionbr br 1 it was not a true adaption of the book from the articles i had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to and that seemed reasonable no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand and not even then but there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining i didnt like that either what the movies press release should have said iswe got the basic very basic idea from shirley jacksons book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading characters names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first and decided to throw in a bit of them toobr br 2 they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad no instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fearlike lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experimentnice guy this doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from daybr br 3 in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened thereand this time around nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of the changeling the only problem was the socalled mystery was so incoherently told that im sure it remained a mystery to most of the audiencebut then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad to begin with its first victim died before ever setting eyes on itbr br 4 the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous he was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was a true skeptic of its historyand in this one he was just a wineyvoiced bumbling nerd who couldnt sleepinsomnia remember and was a compulsive liarbr br 5 i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with nels sisters family and mrs dudleys little opening speech to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting its like it couldnt make up its mind what it wanted to dobr br 6 i missed nels narrative through the whole movie the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through nels eyes and we always were privy to her thoughts that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version they also tried to make nel much more of a heroine the original nel was not a bad person but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister and she liked to moan and she lost her temper this one was almost too good to be true this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writers had obviously been watching ghost one too many timesbr br 7 they changed the history of the house and its occupents too much there was no abigail crain the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no nursery there was also no grace wife of the original doctor and hugh crains wives died in totally different ways these changes changed the story way too much i dont know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they shouldbe sorry if ya get my drift the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled withbr br in conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie this movie should be burnt to the ground and the ground sprinkled with salt my favorite movie of all time remains so no competition from this one
