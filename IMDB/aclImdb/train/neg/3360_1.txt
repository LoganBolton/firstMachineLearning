somewhere in his nonfiction book danse macabre stephen king suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them if at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through the reader may be a little scared but hell also think well i can deal with that at least it wasnt a hundred feet tall theres nothing more frightening than what lurks unseen and unknown just on the other side of that tightly closed door waiting to get youbr br the haunting is so completely misconceived that director jan de bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling look everybody look its a tenfoottall bug isnt that scary the law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in by the end of the movie the director is so to speak jumping up and down banging his cgi pots and pans madly and hoarsely screaming look everyone look here come ten hundredfoottall bugs  and now here come a hundred thousandfoottall bugs br br the filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor and there are many they cant and dont in fact impressive as they are the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them  whether in admiration or annoyance  instead of being immersed in a storybr br for me the nadir of this films sheer stupidity comes when a statue with blood gushing from its mouth tries to drown liam neeson as dr marrow in a fountain the filmmakers clearly didnt know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it so they just have neeson thrash around in the water a bit flailing his arms and going glugglug by the next scene the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and ho hum forgotten all about the annoying incidentbr br shirley jacksons novel seems to have been dumbeddown into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of lowiq teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder okay next lets uh make the ceiling you know look like a creepy face and uh come down on her  and all these spiky things like trap her in the bedbr br the sole saving grace of the haunting is that it at last becomes so awful that its actually funny by the time owen wilson as luke sanderson fell on the floor and then went on his magiccarpet ride o death i just about fell on the floor myself laughingbr br badly constructed witless grotesquely heavyhanded utterly unbelievable and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes this vacuous haunting is a textbook example of how not to make a horror movie
