the haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematographyyes remakes arent all bad but remakes directed by jion da bont definitely arei suppose that the alist actors liam neesoncatherine zeta jonesowen wilsonare there to distract us from the boring plotridiculous special effects and terrible attempts at scaring its audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we dont care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missedthe storyline is like taking the classic novel the haunting of hill house and ripping out four chapters and then using whatevers left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplainedthe characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you dont really care about any of the characters at alllily taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like shes 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she islily taylor isnt made for the horror genre at allthe ghosts are stupid and cheesy they look like a bunch of casper the friendly ghosts and the ghost of hugh cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for halloween with a smoke machinethere is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and its not even funny unintentionally just plain sadthe house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesnt save it from its brutal everything elsei can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching the haunting on tv for no price so i wouldve been even more pied if i had paid to see it but luckily it was on scream channeloverall the haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects a poor attempt at horror
