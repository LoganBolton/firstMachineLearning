this poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects for example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when nell and theo are lying side by side in twin beds listening in terror to the noises outside their room nell tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her nell then looks across at theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand in the latest version nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened and can anybody explain what nells final words mean  its about family its always been about familybr br the one redeeming feature is lili taylors performance but even this cannot save the film catherine zetajones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth in the original claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion zetajones however has to spell it out for example by asking nell if she has a boyfriend  or girlfriendbr br definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard
