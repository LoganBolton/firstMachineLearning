the haunting if you have seen the original you know a great ghost story its perfection on film its a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements it terrified people it still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film so when the haunting was remade in 1999 a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction what why what the but in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation im pretty cool with it this is definitely not the case this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and i guarantee will deliver no scares pfft pg13 what where they thinking not much apparentlybr br when her mother dies and her sister evicts her nell receives a phone call telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by doctor david marrow at hill house a secluded manor upon arrival nell meets mr and mrs dudley a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark shortly thereafter two other participants in the study arrive wild theo and bad sleeper luke sanderson along with doctor marrow unknown to the participants doctor marrows true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear each night the caretakers chain the gate outside hill house preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning when the caretakers open the lock there are no working telephones inside hill house and the nearest town is several miles away doctor marrow revels the story of hill house the house was built by hugh crain crain built the house for his wife hoping to fill it with a large family full of children however all of crains children died during birth crains wife killed herself before the house was finished and crain became a recluse the first night theo and nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words welcome home eleanor and becomes extremely distraught setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by crains cruelty she learns that crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him he then burned the bodies in the houses fireplace to hide any evidence she also learns that crain had a second wife named carolyn of whom nell is descended everyone thinks shes crazy while nell is convinced this is where she belongsbr br seriously i suggest you stay away from this film its really stupid and pointless not to mention the actress the played nell lili taylor completely annoyed me her performance her look just everything about her dont get me started on things i would do just to not see her in film again catherine zeta jones just didnt fit in her role as well and liam neeson a wonderful actor wasted talent once again the effects are way over the top and too computerized i just cant believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud believe me if you are going to be afraid of something be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid oh this film is already hurting me just dont see it its badbr br 110
