well my goodness am i disappointed when i first heard news of a remake of robert wises 1963 film the haunting i had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summermovie sized visual effects but deep down i had faith surely with such a talented cast intactde bont and company will not ruin a film whos original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety well subtlety where are you now my fears have manifesteda promising movie has gone wrong yes eugenio zannettis production design is jawdropping the movie is wonderfully photographed and composer jerry goldsmith can never ever do wrong but the script puts its fine actors to the testasking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies in the end the always wonderful lili taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignityand thats just barely but the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us we can no longer use our imaginations feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown no we get some visual effects to show us what were supposed to be afraid ofand you know what as wonderfully realized as they arethe visual effects come off as sort of silly and the climax is a phantasmogoric messbut things had gone terribly wrong long before that br br everything in the haunting is overdone and overblown im afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosityonly groans check out the original insteadbr br
