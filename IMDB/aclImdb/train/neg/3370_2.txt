just a dumb old movie first stanwycks son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way in an effort to save him stanwyck gets unlucky yet again and comes across an escaped convict she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way in the end her husband is saved and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is alls well than ends dumbbr br i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywoods glamouroriented golden era that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short running a little over an hour its as though the director sensed that he was making crap so he thought it best to keep the crap short
