awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming crisp location photography but its too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldnt make it back in time because really she was saddled with the wet in more ways than one husbandand she had an idiot child as wellwhy not run off with meeker but the nagging question remainswhat sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didnt float stanwyck always impeccably professional does the best she could with the material but its threadbare
