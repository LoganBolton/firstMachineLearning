a pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director richard attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and muddies the thrust of the play the show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a bway musical and examines their drive  desire to work in this demanding and notalwaysrewarding line of work attenborough gives us a freshfaced cast of hopefuls assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show along with a couple of newcomers the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 1617 on the line depending on how you count cassie who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorlyconceived film
