this film is regarded by some as a classic  ive no idea why it is terrible to the point of being laughable the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at thembr br there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film but so what there is no plot it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery and michael douglas is as depressing as ever my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldnt believe how bad a film can get he was rightbr br normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldnt watch it but in this case i think people should as it will put every other bad film youve seen in perspective
