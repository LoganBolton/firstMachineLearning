i recently bought the dvd forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of a chorus line every change the director attenborough made to the story failedbr br by making the directorcassie relationship so prominent the entire ensemblepremise of the musical sails out the windowbr br some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed the shows hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassies characterbr br the overall staging is very selfconsciousbr br the only reason i give it a 2 is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the films attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it
