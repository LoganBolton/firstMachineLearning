michael bennett and nicholas dantes broadway show ran for years but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation which most likely stems from the choice of director richard attenborough as far from bway as you could get and lead actor michael douglas who plays a directorchoreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer the slim story about a grueling audition for a broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actordancersingers is pushed right up on us with loud brassy talents playing to the rafters nothing is modulated or subtle particularly a laughable subplot about a exdancer returning to the theater and butting heads with oldflame douglas the overeager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing this matched with attenboroughs sluggish pacing spells disaster and even the nowfamous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping 12 from
