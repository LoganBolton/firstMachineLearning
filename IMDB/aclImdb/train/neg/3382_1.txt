this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is baffling take audrey landers as val dance 10 looks 3 is vals song vals story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately shes a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who cant dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the boatbr br then theres the choreography im sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didnt they use his choreography it really cant be improved upon
