definitely one of funny man eddie murphys lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child three hundred year old dragons and a chosen onebr br murphy is the chosen one in question and as the opening song suggests he is the best man in the world a finder of lost and missing children he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman charlotte lewis who tells him he is the chosen one and that it is his destiny to find and rescue the golden child for if the child were to die compassion would die with him as he is the bearer of compassionbr br if all this hocus pocus rubbish hasnt ruined it for you now it surely will once the movie begins suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film meant to be another vehicle for murphys egotistical brand of humour the comedy isnt so great mind you the movie fails on many levels even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa cant do much for proceedings very silly and disappointingbr br sunday december 12 1993  tv
