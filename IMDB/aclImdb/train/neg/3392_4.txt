whats with indonesian musical movies never have i seen indonesian musical movies like the ones made in bollywood they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of what they called poetic linesbr br this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks its a simple story plot but its quite focused though with meant to be musical story lines here and therebr br confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected the main actress may try to live up the character but its the best that she could do trying as for the casting i dont feel the necessity to put a balinese student in that story and of course thats not the only unnecessary charactersbr br the strange thing is why would i want to watch this movie maybe because of the mangoes
