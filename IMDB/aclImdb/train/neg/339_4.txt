unlike the adventures of buckaroo banzai or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and selfdeprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations the golden child is just plain badbr br the premise itself is not unworkable and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the mystic secrets of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compelbr br without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we carebr br who should see this filmbr br  big fans of eddy murphy who cant help themselvesbr br  i cant think of anyone elsebr br ill give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked
