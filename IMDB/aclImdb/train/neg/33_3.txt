this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoonbr br theres this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are its atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didnt bother me so much so that i didnt even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all its miserably forgettablebr br the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja
