i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award but after watching it its easy to see why it didnt despite the beautiful photography the film is incredibly slow moving despite having hardly any plotbr br the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents death in what may or may not have been an accident the film is never clear on this and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot but theyre very short and dont really seem to have any point br br the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend  the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient but that doesnt make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure perfect metaphor for this film really br br the photography of skye is beautiful though but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed  and its infinitely better than this one
