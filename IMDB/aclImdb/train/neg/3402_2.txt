heres why the jane show wont work once again canadian bonehead producers and writers cant create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people dont watch a lot of tv from the us which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top forklift races give me freaking break heres a little advice for the writers of the show dont write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an improv monkey
