this film should have been fun a young lea thompson a young joaquin phoenix and terry oquinn in space but it dragged on had unlovable characters and had no target audiencebr br some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs named appropriately jinx the space scenes are then long repetitive the same accident happens twice and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view adults will be bored and cheesed out kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about itbr br there is a budding romance but unlike the shuttle  this never takes off why it is included in the first place is unclear except maybe to add extra tension between the characters  but it failed if that was the ideabr br a young lea thompson should be quirky and attractive right i mean back to the future is great but no she was irritating and averagelooking not someone youd want to date have as a friend or even consider as a role model joaquin phoenix hes really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance maybe he can act like mikey in the life cereal commercials but he doesnt seem to know how to be a normal boy he doesnt fit in on screen and i dont think we can identify with him at home i actually would have been happier if he had never returned to earthbr br i dont recommend this film to anyone
