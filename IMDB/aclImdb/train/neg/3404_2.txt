im not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical fuckups it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isnt even remotely possible others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities alreadybr br given all that i still could have sort of enjoyed it if only they hadnt included all the maudlin nauseating infuriating disneyesque sentimental crap which is so out of place anywhere but nowhere more than out in space where the tiniest mistake can mean instant deathbr br the crew as well as the real astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else it completely ruined any value the production may have had leftbr br im surprised nasa let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them if you havent seen this yet save yourself the irritation watch apollo 13 again at least that tried to be sort of real
