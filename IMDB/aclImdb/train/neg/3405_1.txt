i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is its like watching police academy except its with people that have no clue of what they are talking about andwait there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick i can understand suspension of disbelief but this is just complete stupidity not only is there no plot to this movie its like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor throw nonmedical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility plus the people are wearing clothes that are unbefitting for a space program i feel like im watching a valleygirls b movie in space
