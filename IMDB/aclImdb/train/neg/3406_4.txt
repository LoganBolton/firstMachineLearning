space camp which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the challenger accident deserves such luck the stars make a mockery of acting lea thomson actually being turned sideways when asked for more than her usual wideeyed innocent smile presumably to mask her risible attempts the movie is at times hilarious when it begins to ask far too much of you a small boy keeps a multimillion dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dormmates this hackneyed and unlovable machine jinx is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie which seems part short circuit part 2001 by the airplane team i shant bore you with this suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it having said all of this it is enjoyable to watch in a seaquest saved by the bell kind of way the romance and technology beware are as unbelievable as each other also if youre an eighties freak its unmissable for the amusing performances of kate capshaw willie from temple of doom and obviously lea thompson also joaquin phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe goonie who befriends jinx do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash
