this is just horrible really horrible trash yes weve got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex but while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a film with actual things to say with real emotion and struggle it isnt its an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time im sure all of these women and men in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s    but not in the actual movie businessbr br the acting was hackneyed so bad i mean real terrible the writing was even worse i cant lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar as a sniper these shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough if there was more writing  better writing much better writing  and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work withbr br this movie should have been shot made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along it would have made more money it practically is a hardcore porn film already and it remains the only nonporn movie ive seen that shows a male erect penis
