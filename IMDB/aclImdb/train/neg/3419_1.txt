ok so chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced i have one questionwhy who read this script and said sounds great original this movie is regurgitated crap that i wouldnt tarnish my toilet bowel with of course it is another story following in the tradition of mia invasion usa walker texas ranger delta force and so on in which chuck norris of course is the one man who can same america from some bad guys he doesnt even need a gun most times its stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris films is chucks son eric eric norris has primarily worked on all his fathers films and tv shows doesnt this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent afterall hes directing the same people as before in the same stories as beforeonly difference is the characters names if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined hopefully this will be the nail in chuck norriss acting coffin
