i saw this movie the first time at about twelve oclock on a saturday evening it really is the perfect time for this one i have never ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes if you want to see a thrilling action movie dont watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through however if you want a good laugh please watch it i even bought the chuck norris 3dvd collection thanks to my enjoyable saturday night what especially struck me is that Ã©very scene that would be expensive to make was copypasted from a discovery documentary or an old tvspecial on the us army furthermore i was amazed by the fact that they didnt put the slightest effort in making the production look real afghanistan is as far as i can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click deke escapes from the terrorists sandcastle with his jetpack and is taken away by a submarine probably discovery later on in the movie deke throws an islam terrorist against the wall in the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall gotta love it i recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then youll understand why ive been mad enough to spend 699 euros on the box
