star rating  the works  just misses the mark  that little bit in between  lagging behind  the pits br br some plutoniums gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction so josh mccord chuck norris and his cocky young protégé deke judson mills a different actor from the previous film with the assistance of joshs adopted daughter que jennifer tung set out to stop thembr br this was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 911 filmed in 2001 norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown new york that day so thered have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his sidekick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else other than that its as interchangeable as anything norris has ever been in it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place and whether if this one could get made a presidents man 3 might come out sometime soonbr br if youve seen one norris film youve really seen them all and theres really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one but at least you know what youre getting and like i said it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam
