oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldnt believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the governments plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is unarmed and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy ive finally found a movie worse than plan 9 from outer space
