this must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely africanamerican cast every derogatory disparaging stereotype of the black american community is featured prominently i wont reinforce the insults by listing them here except to mention chickens watermelons and dicebr br one good song by ethel waters and a couple of bad ones and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8yearold sammy davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the imdb scale
