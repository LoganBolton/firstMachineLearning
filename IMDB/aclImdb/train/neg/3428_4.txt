well if it werent for ethel waters and a 7yearold sammy davis jr here billed without the jr rufus jones for president would be one of the worst representations of africanamerican stereotypes ive seen from the early talkie era and wouldnt have been worth seeing because of that ms waters is excellent here singing am i blue and underneath our harlem moon while mr davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult hes so good tapdancing here that for awhile i thought he was a little person with decades of experience so if youre willing to ignore the negative connotations here rufus jones for president should provide some good enjoyment ps this marks the fourth time today ive seen and heard the song ill be glad when youre dead you rascal you performed on film this time by davis must have been a very popular song about this time
