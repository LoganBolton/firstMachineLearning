it is such a strange movie you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laughathon strange comes to mind again and again shot amateurishly acted even worse and the directions maybe none the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit see it if you got time to kill but dont dont even try to take it seriously supposed to be a tribute to porno holocaust  since i havent seen it from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad should have given it 110 but it did give me a good laugh or two so it gets a 3 excessive gore the only thing somebody worked on stay away if you are squeamish more gore than laughs wonder if the makers had a laugh making it
