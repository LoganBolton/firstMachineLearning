i am a huge horrorsplatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a pointbr br after reading the other peoples reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films ive ever watchedbr br the acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie  but not in this casebr br i waisted 11 eur to get this dvd br br unless you actually enjoy pointless gore  for example the violent sht films avoid at any cost
