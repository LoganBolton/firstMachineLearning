i ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations i think i paid about 50 for this movie as an eternal fan of horror from cheesy 80s american slashers to european zombie films i told myself this was going to be great i cant tell you how wrong i was first of all i thought it was gonna be pretty much gorier than it actually is after all ive had heard about this film i was almost scared to watch it the murders are boring the acting forget it theres no acting the story even if we dont care is incredibly bad it seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls but unfortunately in this case it doesnt help the movie why theres no atmosphere and this is the worst thing about this flick its just bad filmmaking from point a to b though its extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers dont make any effort to get your hands on it there are so many movies in this world dont waste your time watching necro files
