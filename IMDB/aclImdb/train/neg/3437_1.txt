i saw this film yesterday i must admit it werent my cup of tea although its supposed to be a horror movie of its kind but as i was watching this i was thinking this movie isnt making any sense at all where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind where on earth did a shark came out frombr br all these elements in this film somehow didnt add up i felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crapbr br ive seen many good horror movies in my time but this is one of the most worst horror flicks ive seen at the end of the movie i said to myself that i wouldnt watch it again so much pappy show in this film ive decided to give it the thumbs down count me out on this one 0 out of 10
