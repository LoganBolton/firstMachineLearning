probably minor spoilersbr br i cant say i liked it but i cant say i didntits very strange it has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst cgi you can imagineif i was the director i would cut that part for sure gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie for some people it will be boring cause it lacks action feels home made sometimes take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what nopnot cryingtheir telling horror stories to each othersighsjust after crying for hes lostbr br another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like hundreds of candles in the table in front of themthe boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtainsold rags covering the windows and sofascouches i thought it was dumb using candles but not thinking about the surroundings besides being in high sea alonebr br the good some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of so this movie does it good maybe because its a low budget i dont know but it works fine for me you will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones i mentioned abovebr br do not expect much of it but if you like anykind of movie watch this one be patient try to enjoy lolbr br sorry about my raw english br br cheers
