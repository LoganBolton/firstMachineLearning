a truly truly dire canadiangerman coproduction the everwonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term problem child  a few uears prior to the action the child murdered her father and mum took the fall for the offspring now shes moved up to the northwest us to start over but her child still has a problem in that shes devoted to her mother so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bondbr br unfortunately mandy schaeffer as the daughter murders more than people  she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie though the incoherent script useless direction and appalling music check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikiniclad bod dont help any were supposed to find her sexy and scary but she fails on both counts almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing not to mention the fact that arquette and schaeffer dont really convince as mother and daughter all condolences to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow both of whom are worthy of far more than this and both of whom particularly rosanna are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farragobr br one of the production companies is called quality international films  not since the threehour love lies and murder from two short productions has there been such a you must be joking credit
