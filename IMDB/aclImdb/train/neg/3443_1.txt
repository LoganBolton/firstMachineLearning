i watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailerseven the cover of the dvd looked goodas soon as i started watching it i was thinking like others oh my god whats thisthere were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid musicthere was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenesthat right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn i wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the cover artnothing against the music itselfit was just in the wrong parts of the moviewhoever edited the film has no clue what they are doingthe cover showed lightning implying they were caught in a storm at seathat would have been more interesting but it didnt happen the acting wasnt the worst ive ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first filmanother reason i was disappointed was the plot made no sensein the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boatthen at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts im not sure because it was very badly portrayed whytefox who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true storyhe or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmedthere was no mention in this movie about it being a true storyi have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying its impossiblei guess if anyone is interested in renting this moviedo it at your own riskif you like amateur student horror films you may like this
