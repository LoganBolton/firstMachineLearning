this is by far the worst movie ive ever seen from the plot though the shots the special effects the acting and did i mentioned the plot every single thing in it sucked assbr br this is a good example of what overdoing means and ill try to explainbr br i understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you cant really tell what the hell is going on up until the end you sit mesmerized not knowing whos dead and whos alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out youre wrong and the movie ends  leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes something like unbreakable or the job if you know what i meanbr br but olga levens the writer of this junk yes olga Â– the writer director producer screenplay author caster production designer art director costume designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to olga levens from levens productions you cant go wrong br br well this might come as a shocker but this time olga over did this big time jumping from scene to scene from dreams to reality but wait this was all a dream after all or was it the picture fades and i realized none of this ever happened the girl was all alone on the ship actually there was no ship no wait theres the ship again and the guys theyre alive thank god no theyre calling her to join the cruise but then the ship disappears so maybe theyre dead after all or maybe they never were alive to begin withbr br if you understood what i just said you might like this movie  otherwise its a boring piece of work and the only reason i set through this entire crap is to find out how the hell can they finish this moviebr br dont watch this if you value time ever 90 minutes are a waste in this case
