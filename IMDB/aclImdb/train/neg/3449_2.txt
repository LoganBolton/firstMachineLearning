mercifully theres no video of this wannabe western that a stayafloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a backroom writer all in all this show stinks the story is basically boring illconceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it underrated the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so youll have to catch it on the last show if you up late and having a bout of insomnia but if you can sit through it youve more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends
