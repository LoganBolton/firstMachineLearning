someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to high noon now that is a real stretch im a big sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been don knotts first off as someone pointed out sinatra just doesnt have the build for a western badguy wannabe hes just too slight at this point in his life maybe he was about the same height as say audie murphy but murphy had a pretty solid build sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriouslybr br the story is uninspired and really not credible i dont want to spoil it but i think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story doesnt make any sense another thing these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some bad guy this is just a little town so i dont get the attraction nor do i understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that waybr br there is a love interest in the story and if i followed it right she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy wouldnt kill him now theres true love for you stand up for yourself tell him your name so he will kill you lol stop youre killing mebr br unfortunately the basic premise of the movie isnt good enough and no matter how they tried this story didnt have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket want to know why its not on video and never shown on tv the critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right  this movie is pretty bad i would almost bet sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possiblebr br you want to see a good western where a town stands up against a bad guy try tension at table rock or at gunpoint  two really really good westerns with that theme johnny concho is johnny stinko frank you were the greatest singer ever  but you didnt belong in a movie like this
