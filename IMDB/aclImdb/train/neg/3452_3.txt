i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festivals prestigious competition section i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging qualitybr br the film some reviewers have noted does not have too much of gunfirebut the inherent violence is repulsive imagine killing your enemycompetitor in front of your young sonor forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copollas godfather that seem to resurface here in this chinesehong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheesebr br this film is only recommended for violence junkiesthere is no great cinema here at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values
