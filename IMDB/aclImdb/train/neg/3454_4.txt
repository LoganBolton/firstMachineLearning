cut tries to be like most postscream slashers tried to be a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies now i am not bagging scream as i think scream is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy cut fails on most levels it has its moments but overall it just does not work out not even as a so bad its good movie just a below average onebr br the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well apart from the fact that kylie minogue cant really act and ironically she gets her tongue out go figure go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off which is apparently cursed and as you have probably predicted one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madmanbr br unoriginal plot poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow there is plenty of referencing in the film everything from scream to the texas chain saw massacre this isnt smart either it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it really i should be supporting this movie because im australian and were not as good when it comes to horror we do have our gems though but cut is definitely not one of thembr br however it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so so that is something good at least i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for but if you are looking for a good movie stay awaybr br 25
