geez this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didnt i mean you didnt give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mindbr br to be honest and brief this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made i cant say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell its made by professional film makersbr br the death scenes are horrible bloodless stupid the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied popcorn from 1991br br to make things even worse this isnt a movie so bad that its good its just plain badbr br molly ringwald tried to do her best but it wasnt enough
