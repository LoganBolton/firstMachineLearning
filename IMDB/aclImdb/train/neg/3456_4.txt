everyone in this movie tells raffy carruthers how talented she is what a great director shell one day turn out to be etc i think theyre just being nice even kimble rendall who directed this film shows more talent than she does the next jane campion they call her and even apart from the fact that theyre both overrated the two have so much in common they both direct movies theyre both women theyre both australian well give or takebr br yep its one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant and we just have to swallow hard and accept it but ill say this for carruthers shes cute and fascinating no really here are some thoughts on her lack of talentbr br 1 part of a directors talent lies in dealing with people why is carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed i expectbr br 2 why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen after all it must have been filmed on a real movie set how could they get it wrong if rendalls set was half as much of an understaffed shambles its a wonder he completed his film at allbr br 3 carruthers  the fictional director  has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick fat chance i doubt it can be done these days i suspect that rendall  the actual and more talented director  set himself the same task realised it couldnt be done and settled for sigh knowing parody instead of course its not enough of a parody to work as a parody as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did  well less badlybr br 4 and yet and yet  the film opens with not a parody but an honesttogoodness pastiche of 80s horror starring this is too good to be true molly ringwald this pastiche is much better than anything that follows its a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the moviewithinthemovie rather than the movie yet it too was filmed in the late 1990s perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean itbr br 5 id never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents but now i know and strangely im glad i know a need i never knew i had has been fulfilled
