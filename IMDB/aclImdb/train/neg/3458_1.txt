normally im not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasnt ive heard it said that the movie didnt take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the moviebr br cut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else
