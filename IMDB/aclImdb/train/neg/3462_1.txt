slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrongvery wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad its just plain stupid everything about it especially the killers origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie savvy characters im so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally
