i saw this movie the other night and i have to honestly say its one of the worst films ive ever seen the acting is fair but the plot is totally ridiculous a killer is born because of all the energy used to make the movie and if the film is burned the killer will die how unbelievable is that the characters were underdeveloped to say the leastfor example all of a sudden the man mentions arent you trying to complete the film because your mother couldnt so were supposed to go along with this we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film the movie really didnt spotlight on anyone we didnt know anything about the main people who survived except ringwalds character was a whiney actress the guy was on the set when the people died and raffy wanted to be a director like her mother not truly diving in to know who they are seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making i cant believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture its not funny it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film i found myself predicting what would happen before each scene which believe you me wasnt hard at all to do its a disgrace and im deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess 110
