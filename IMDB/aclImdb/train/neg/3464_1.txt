it seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live hows that for a ringing endorsement if this movie was filmed near where i lived i wouldnt be mentioning it in my review it is horrid several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongueincheek horror movie it is neither it is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well i did laugh though at how unbelievably bad the film wasbr br this movie has 2 good things going for it the mask and the weapon of choice unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage the social commentary behind the film is also laughable juvenile and stupid dont bother with this movie youve already wasted time reading this review dont waste anymore on this movie arrggghhh its infuriating that movies like this even get made i was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to alan smithee a name used when a person usually a director doesnt want to be credited with a movie because its so badbr br there is nothing redeeming in this movie i spent 119 on the rental and feel i was ripped off avoid 1 out of 10
