a slasher flick made in the early 80s has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead years later a group of film students attempted to complete the movie  also resurrecting the films deadly curse great idea for a film but sadly cut is just another wasted opportunitybr br unfortunately australia hasnt had the worlds best track record when it comes to horror razorback 1984 was an out and out dud as was holwing iii 1987 which was half an american film anyway as for our foray into comedyhorror body melt 1993 is best left forgotten the problem with cut is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la scream 1996 but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work and although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what cut really lacks is any heart sure it follows the basic rules established by scream but it doesnt want to play with the formula instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlierbr br the killer scarman is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history his endless barrage awkwardly lame oneliners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare the cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks and the feel of the film is like its deliberately trying not to be creepy looking more like an episode of neighbors or heartbreak high by the way those attempts at mtv style hypercinema during the research sequence just look lame dated and out of placebr br if australia ever gets a chance to do horror again which i hope we still do maybe we should take a leaf from the mad max 1979 book instead of trying to copy the us we should be trying our own take on the genre
