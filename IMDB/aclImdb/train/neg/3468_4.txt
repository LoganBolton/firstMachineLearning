a student filmmaker enlists a bgrade actress a delectably divaish molly ringwald to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull kylie minogue tried to make 12 years ago its a curious plot choice to say the least as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors the film has a curse on it because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set but shes back because she needs the exposure unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set cut is an aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesnt bring anything new or exciting to the table in fact it rips half of wes cravens 90s filmography lots of filmworld namedropping a la scream except its aussie namedroppingjane campionsee how this isnt as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la new nightmare the editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a welldressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at dont worry well treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesnt mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump ha and mollys ridiculous oneliners were enough to not regret renting this one you got any diet coke in here as she rides in the film professors car and does anyone know where i can buy any tofu the first thing she mutters on the set and where the hell is my agent oh wait thats what i was thinking for her
