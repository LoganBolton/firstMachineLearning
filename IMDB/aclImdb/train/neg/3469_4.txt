while filming an 80s horror movie called hot blooded the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer after all of this the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though theyre warned by people to keep away from the film as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film from this its labelled as a cursed production not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role but not as the daughter but the mother but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the films killerbr br look what scream started hey i enjoy those films but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses during this stage the subgenre came back with vengeance but it wasnt much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise cut which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick but you know what i found it a cheesy delight yeah its gawd awful and highly forgettable but its a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted although i did hate it when i originally came across it but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again but this time it wasnt so sweetbr br the film came out around the same time as scream 3 and urban legends the final cut did which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie scream 3 is obviously the strongest of the three but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends the final cut though it did seem more of a throwback to the 80s slashers than that of one of screams bastard offspring pretty much the film is given bgrade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense while the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it she plays the washup actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous sendup performance she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars thats if youre an australian with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts also pop singer and supposed actress kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up nice these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dimwitted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue because they have no real substance to be therebr br the plot starts off rather interestingly then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up but then it makes a sudden uturn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre simply its rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinkingÂ… oh my this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner but sadly it falls along way but dont you just love an opening ending also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential tongueincheek approach predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become overstated at times but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added some spookiness the cinema scene is done rather nicely toobr br now now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick but sadly theres no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard if lacking but its more then decent for such lowbudget flick there are one or two creative deaths but the rest are systematic the killer wasnt bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought well the smartass attitude didnt sit well with me another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cutaway editing outofplace soundtrack and kimble rendalls direction lacked execution and was pretty careless but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badnessbr br the imagination matches the budget thats for sure but heck this lousy slasher wasnt trying to be anything else pure schlock thats slightly amusing
