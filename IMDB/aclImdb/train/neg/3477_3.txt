not as bad as youve heard there are actually some funny parts and affleck and applegate have fairly good chemistry applegate in particular is appealing and likable as afflecks love interest james gandolfini and catherine ohara are consummate professionals theyre pretty good in just about everything in the end surviving is not the worst holiday movie youll ever see br br unfortunately it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced the attempts at dark humor come off as dour affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed his characters cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and oharas more muted believable performances even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies you never fully buy into the setup of affleck renting this family for xmasbr br there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness the xmas eve scene replete with incestuous humor a son being discovered looking at naked provocative pictures of his mother that not only isnt funny or believable but disturbingbr br to make matters worse the colors in this film are muddy almost noirish the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheapbr br surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds paycheck gigli jersey girl and this for affleck it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be
