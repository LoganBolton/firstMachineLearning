may contain spoilersbr br i say that but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the startbr br this is not a movie that i liked i didnt hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending there were funny bits along the way to be sure but few were original at least it didnt go for the gutterbr br christina applegate looks fresh and ben affleck works hard their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature everyone else is a cardboard cutout including surprisingly james gandolfini who must have made this as a favor to someonebr br all in all its a harmless but not inspiring 90 minutes
