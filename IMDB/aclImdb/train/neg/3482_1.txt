so i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star i hated it it was so stupid and unrealistic i cant believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd projectbr br james g and cathrine ohara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover but to just walk awayi dont even want to get into what the movie is about because it is too stupid to pontificate aboutbr br dont rent this its horrible horrible
