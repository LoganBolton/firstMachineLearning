i remember when this was in theaters reviews said it was horrible well i didnt think it was that bad it was amusing and had a lot of tongueincheek humor concerning families around holiday timebr br ben affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for christmas to please his girlfriend he goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for christmas i really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract that was funnybr br so he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest and he learns that the holidays arent so bad after allbr br also the whole doodah act was funny especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy and the girlfriendss parents didnt even say anything about it and the parts where doodah is hitting on his supposed daughter final verdict i thought its worth checking out if you catch it on cable
