this movie was pretty absurd there was a few funny parts its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think hmmthat movie had a few funny parts but overall pretty ridiculous plot or lack ofbr br i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy and i didnt understand how he was a self made multimillionaire and still such an idiot anyways i like ben affleck he makes some crap but hey i can forgive him i mean i liked jersey girl i didnt think gigli was all his fault i like him overall i guess hes kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just cant seem to get it rightbr br my advice would be to avoid this flick it didnt really develop in to a workable plot and catherine ohara and jimmy g werent used as well as they could have been they deserved better overall this movie is not home alone its not a christmas story its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics forever forgettable
