i get the feeling that those involved in making surviving christmas didnt put much thought into the movie the characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the oneliner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend christmas with thembr br ben affleck portrays drew latham the typical hollywood image of a wealthy egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life his girlfriend missy leaves him shortly before christmas because shes disgusted that drew wanted to take her to fiji for christmas which she calls the family holiday and the fact that drew has never introduced her to his family we later find out that drews father left when he was 4 years old and his mother is dead so its a mystery why he doesnt just say that he has no family rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesnt care about his familybr br out of fear of being alone on christmas drew tracks down missys shrink why i have no idea who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home when he meets the family living in his childhood home the valcos drew offers them 250000 to pretend to be his family so he can relive his fond childhood memories he gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter alicia christina applegate because he doesnt have a sister and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his real family none of this makes any sense once drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his motherbr br also inexplicable is the character of alicia who is annoyed that her family accepted drews money and refuses to play along with his fantasy but for no good reason she suddenly starts to like drew and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy i almost wish he had finished with just kidding the real reason i dont see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me 210
