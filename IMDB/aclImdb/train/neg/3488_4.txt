question how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration  answer by turning it into an existential alienation parablebr br yes were back in the early 90s just after the disintegration of the eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the european union and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middleclass journalist an existentially alienated upperclass politician his existentially alienated rich wife and so onbr br in the background immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed greek village near the borders i guess that way angelopoulos can show some social awareness while dealing with the existentially troubled upperclasses i mean honestly the scene where some topranking armyofficer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in london is enough to make you pukebr br anyway it cant be that bad angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all right  wrong its at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial sort of like a filtered image in photoshop his usual tricks show up there are blurred windows blurred lights a weird wedding a walk by the rivershore and people with yellow watercoats also mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever avoid really go for his early films
