having enjoyed jean arthur in the devil and miss jones my interest was peaked so i tried sitting through this secondstring screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockeybut i didnt make it to the end arthur photographed in a gauzy moviemagazine fashion either wants alimony from exhusband william powell or another shot at marriage but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks shes the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness but once inside a morguelike all women in these 30s comediesshe faints william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur but youd never know it from the end result they look awkward standing next to each other hesitant over their banter the actor playing powells valet is excruciating and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease
