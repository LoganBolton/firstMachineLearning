i dont buy kung fu movies for a plot i buy them for fight scenes a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes but not the other way aroundbr br the story was decent but moved too slowly for my tastes there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout lasting only a couple of minutes apiece the last fight was a bit longer but by that point i was so bored i didnt even pay attention to it
