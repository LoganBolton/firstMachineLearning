i rarely write reviews for imdbcom but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible just terrible i like shaw bros movies im not a hater and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many 10 best kung fumartial arts movies websites im now convinced that those 10 best lists are all cutandpaste jobs first of all theres barely any action in the film most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because its thin at best and the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but its routine by todays standards a special warning to netflix users the dvd they ship is terrible the picture is horrendous and its not even 169 enhanced
