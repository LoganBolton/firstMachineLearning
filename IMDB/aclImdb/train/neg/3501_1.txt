i understand the jokes quite well they just arent good the show is horrible i understand it and thats another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible its not funny not funny i dont want people to say only smart people get it because if theyre so smart why do they judge people they dont even know and say that theyre not smart or intellectual enough to understand it its like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them theyre just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting im not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they dont even know anything about any of us isnt exactly a smart comment
