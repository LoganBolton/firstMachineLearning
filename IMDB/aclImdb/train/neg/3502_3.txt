sarah silverman is really the flavor of the month comic right now is she really worth all the hype yes and no she is funny at times sometimes hilariously so her standup routine is actually quite interesting though not always funny other times youre feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to saying that they dig her intelligence and wit but if you corner them most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her and thats why they watch her she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo even though neither of them are really hot now in terms of popularity sarah doesnt drink or smoke at least cigs so she should be hot when shes 60 so her fans especially the male ones can rejoicebr br as for this show its very much like her comedy when it works its hilarious when it doesnt its full blown tedium and very very boring the aids episode here is the best one its consistently funny and has some really good satire in it brian poeshns character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode and its hilarious seeing him in a tab tshirt but they never really go anywhere with it and it eventually wears out its welcome sarahs character in the series is rather annoying the gay couple brian poeshn and some other guy seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole and the supporting players including sarahs real life sister laura who doesnt look a thing like her are ok when the jokes hit theyre brilliant when they dont theyre awful and i mean really awful theres also an obsession with coprophilia here aka poop jokes which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today so should you watch this show if you have a crush on sarah go for it you can gaze at her and pretend shes yours as for her show its ranges from good to absolute zero
