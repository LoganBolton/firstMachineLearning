and when i watch sarah silverman i get the same results i love quirky irreverent humor but this woman is so darned boring annoying and yawnworthy shes also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because shes just not funny i watched two segments of her program and was ready for novocainebr br geez my kid age 19 saw her promos on comedy central and said she was a dumb chick i thought that was a compliment the one where she says watch my show or ill kill my dog is actually believable i know shes a wanna be comedienne she just comes across as a warped nutcase i just dont ever want to see her around my dog
