i have given this show i have only watched seven episodes four stars because most of her jokessetups appear to fail some are not funny outright but some are amusing  in a 12 year old boy kind of way she reminds me of that new york painter who throws paint upon a canvas calls it art and sells it for a lot of money silverman throws out what shes got including the kitchen sink while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but differentbr br however what shes got often times is not enough as though she lacks the kind of followthrough a good comedian needs to succeedbr br the whole enterprise is like an under done potato
