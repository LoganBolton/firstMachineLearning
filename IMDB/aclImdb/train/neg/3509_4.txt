somewhere inside this movie is a halfhour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out whereas cube was taut wellmade claustrophobic and mindengaging im afraid cypher is a bloated tedious rehash of several wellworn themes which just dont add up to much especially if you have seen almost any other halfway decent scifi film beforebr br cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending none of the characters spark off each other and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube its not a bad movie but it is most definitely not a good onebr br when youve watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating
