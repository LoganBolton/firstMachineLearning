the performances of fishbourne who appears strangely funny somehow and short featureded harris are remarkable unlike connerys who doesnt appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man in fact the screenplay doesnt make sense imagine a 60 min happy endingplot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters its more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screenwrights schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subjectmatter and environment could have been good
