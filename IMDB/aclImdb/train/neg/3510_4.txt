i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasnt impressed i know its taboo to knock independent films but this one felt devoid of entertainmentbr br the premise was interesting but the execution of it fell short i found myself thinking okay theyre just getting into it the story will pick up soon before i knew it the film was over and the story never picked up i cant say i found the acting all that impressive either it was pretty bad not star wars prequel trilogy bad but bad nonethelessbr br im not sure what the running time was ill assume two hours because its a safe estimate anyway when the film was finished i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway throughbr br again i was thoroughly unimpressed and eventually bored out of my wits im not one of those guys who requires fastpaced action and explosions in a film so dont start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it
