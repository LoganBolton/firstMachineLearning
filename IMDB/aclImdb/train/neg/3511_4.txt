im working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and im starting to get confused about who i really am sht ive got a headache and things are going wobbly oh no here comes another near subliminal fastcut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic imagesbr br i rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable why cypher is a cheap derivative dull movie set in a poorly realised bland futureworld with wooden leads and a laughable endingbr br an eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran videobr br its painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little babylon 5 cgi set pieces this sub fight club sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allowbr br cool blue moodiness served up with pofaced seriousness  disappointingly dumb this is not intelligent scifi this is the plot of a computer game
