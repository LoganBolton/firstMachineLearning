i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity for one if stallone is out freeclimbing by himself theres no need to carry any gear but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta mountain climby so lets throw them in for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy where the movie was filmed well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous  foulsmelling stuff for you to swallow
