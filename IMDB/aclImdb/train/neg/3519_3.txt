there are some stallone movies i like but this movie didnt meet my low expectations i found this movie hard to believe for example a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days also in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient shortcuts or plot devices also the treasury cops dont seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people also bad guys who couldnt hit the side of a barn with really hightech looking automatic weaponsbr br i liked john lithgows villain initially but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesnt care at all about any of his own bad guys or all of them getting killed eventually i just couldnt believe the character anymorebr br not worth the price of a rental not even worth taking the time to watch
