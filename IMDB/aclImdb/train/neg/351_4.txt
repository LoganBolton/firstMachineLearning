1st watched 2162002  4 out of 10dirarne glimcher mysterythriller with too many ridiculous plot twists despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright underestimates its audience the moviegoing public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with we think that this movie is going to be about something with connerys conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard contrived for the audiences sake run of the mill lets never get it over with thriller we are pulled into every silly switch in character as they are portrayed to us when its needed in the story and were ready for this thing to be over way before it ends yes there is some good acting here especially from blair underwood fishburne and ed harris in a psychosupporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very longawaited end
