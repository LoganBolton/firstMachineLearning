had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise prisoners finding magic bookoo err claustrophobic terror ensues etc br br but there didnt seem to be a story to go along with the great idea rather than chillingphyscological horror it relied on effects out in the open fire and ott body horror  which didnt scare at all if your over 12 br br the logic at the end is ridiculous with characters being killed off for nothing other than bodycount waste of good characters which were the best thing about this filmbr br obviously low budget which doesnt spoil it the film really goes nowhere and icant believe im going to say this it needs a hollywood remake you simply loose interest in this version definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were at least watchableentertaining malefique isnt watchable to the end to be honest and i bet you can guess the ending before you have watched the film really really disappointing impossible to recommend
