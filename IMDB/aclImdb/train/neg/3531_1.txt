this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be comparedas in was it as stupid as revolver i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose within the first 10 minutes hes given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy of sopranos fame which makes no sense at all then theres some shooting and then theres ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs then theres some animation ray liottas naked butt lots of shooting teeth gnashing art house wanna be pretensions and more of liottas embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showingwhich im not quite sure was the reaction he was looking fornot 5 times anyway everyone in this movie thinks theyre smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks hes yogi bear incarnate the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it
