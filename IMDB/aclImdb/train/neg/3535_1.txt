okay who was it who gave revolver 10 out of 10 are you tripping of your head on ecstasy pipes there were so many of you did you do it for a dare is this some kind of cult or did guy richie himself sign up 788 times under different namesbr br before i say anything else ill say this just because you dont understand a film doesnt mean that its not great maybe youve had a bad day at work or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then werent in the mood maybe theres a more fundamental stumbling block like you just dont have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it but and this is a very very big but the xxl elephantsized megabut to end all butsbr br please dont confuse incoherence for complexity and please dont confuse this two hour nonsquirter for an interesting film really you may think you are pretty smart you may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheeplike naysayers please dont youre embarrassing yourself br br revolvers a waste of everyones time if you thought about if for a few minutes youd recognise it too it was a waste of the cast a waste of the crew a waste of the caterers and definitely a waste of the precious minutes you cant get them back you know of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable wretched messbr br no  wait comes a voice in the darkness you just dont understand its nonlinear that means the story doesnt go in a straight line this is actually the complex and subtle work of an auteur it addresses difficult existential questions and anyway  they slated fight club when it first came out  didnt you hear because they couldnt deal with the complexity theyre eating humble pie now bet you hate lynch films too doncha br br hate to disappoint you but i am quite a big lynch fan i rather like memento so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesnt necessarily fill me with fear and although ive only studied it briefly a few years ago philosophy interests me greatly i dont dislike revolver for these reasons i dislike it because it purports to be about weighty bigbrained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable im not much of a chess player but richies idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old i dislike it because the characters without exception totally alienated me aha cries the richie apologist guy is cleverly tipping his hat to brecht just maybe youre right i think its more likely that he just cant write a decent script for toffeebr br comparing revolver with fight club is actually really instructive fight club has acidtongued nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh revolver has stale fortune cookie reject oneliners that make your ears bleed fight club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened revolver has as far as i can tell several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because well they dont make sense if you keep pulling the rug out from under people they eventually kick you out of their house and then they lock all the doors and windows and they never let you back in everbr br guy richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzzphrases mostly they are spoken but often they flash up on the screen with attributions its almost pathologicalbr br but what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clich√©s in the world ultimately its so inconsequential you dont care about anything you dont understand anything you go homebr br actually there was a bit i really liked the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence hes great but i cant recommend you see the film just to see him hes only in it for a few minutesbr br please believe me its horrible
