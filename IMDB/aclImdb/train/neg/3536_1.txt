i dont think ive ever felt this let down by a film before after loving guy ritchies two previous films i dont count swept away  he was pussy blind i was so looking forward to seeing this br br the reviews were poor then again i dont trust the press anyway more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker so it was with some trepidation i handed over my Â£480 yesterday afternoonbr br im not even going to try to explain this film mainly because i havent got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didnt get it br br unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wifes trap of taking himself far too seriouslyit seems it wasnt good enough for him to make films with good plots laughs snappy dialogue and good characters its almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off here are some of the ones i noticedbr br the matrix fight club kill bill the usual suspects vanilla skybr br i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors jason statham and ray liotta were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing  direction that let the film downbr br so a big big thumbs down from me
