was convincing the world that he didnt existbr br this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people its from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser goldi mean sosebr br i got another one like that the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storylinebr br this movie is one of the saddest pieces of filmmaking i have seen in a long time it starts out so well with really fantastic cinematography great acting and a very smart premise but alas the only way this movie is heading is on a course of selfdestruction and it does so not by a single blow but with nagging little wristcutsbr br pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story and they vary from a story set totally in someones head playing chess with himself to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gamingbr br and thats all jolly swell but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story and apart from that it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like fight club kill bill casino the usual suspects snatch magnolia and shachnovelle and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here its a blatant robberybr br what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed if this movie was a rollercoaster ride youd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved that if it was a cocktail youd be needing a life supply of hurlbuckets to work of the nausea after drinking it nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think its going you get pulled in yet another onebr br i guess this story wasnt going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway being the next david lynch or somethingbr br 110 for totally violating ones own work ritchy seek professional help what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived artpiece food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debatingclubs br br spare your soul and stomach avoid at all cost
