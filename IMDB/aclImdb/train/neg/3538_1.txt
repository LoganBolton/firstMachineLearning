after seeing driven on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it just so i dont feel like im the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters with totally inane pretentious nonsense i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamins utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film whilst all the time thinking  what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangstercon man whatever hes supposed to be when he made his offer ill tell you what he would have told him to fk off blown his head away and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jakes head when they offer him their solution to his problem theyre con men therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases i mean ffs doesnt he start to wonder why his symptoms arent getting worse doesnt the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know hes been conned br br anyway i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films bullst this film doesnt try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines oh no it somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny i genuinely didnt hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the ugc in sheffield knows how full a main screen can get and not 1 person so much as smiled maybe he never wanted the film to be funny and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask the unnecessarily baffling plot i sincerely hope notbr br by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over and they were free from their tormentbr br ill round this off ive got to finish writing this is making me angry again by elaborating on the end i mean sht the ending no sorry i cant your just going to have to go and see it it cant be put in words it just cant and after youve seen it youll know why uuhhhhh  shudders 
