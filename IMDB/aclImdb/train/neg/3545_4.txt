the film 52 pick up simply does not work see it if you are at all interested in elmore leonard or john frankenheimer or anyone in the terrific cast especially john glover whos admittedly brilliant but the booka slowburning noir thriller with lots of pulpshould have translated into an oscarcontending film instead of this dud that couldnt figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hardboiled gritty crime story of the book or opt for a 1980s schwarzenegger shootemup spree shifting the scene from the original locale in the book detroit an area where leonard has resided for years and knows very well to los angeles makes for a substantial problem that leonard tries to fix in his script but ultimately cant it was for example a clever device making mitchells wife a city councilwoman she had no job in the book if you think about it thats the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sexcrazed city like 1980s los angeles for adultery or any type of potential sex scandal even then its more plausible in a more conservative eastern state like michigan to believe that a its tiny porno industry is a sleazy moneygrubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a notsostupid uppermiddleclass fellow going through a midlife crisis and b adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with if their upstanding careers and oldfashioned wives couldnt handle the shock as consultant ron jeremy will tell you 1980s los angeles was a colorful stylish porno mecca more like the movie boogie nights than leonards dark shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses grimy apartments and drug deals in depressed urban squalor then again los angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefullythere are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there unfortunately roy scheiders harry mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy handsome uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat in the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing he also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for but never appeared to come to grips with elmore leonards stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and lawabiding citizen here harry mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer alan raimy turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom makes for such a central image glovers blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence but scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky good guy in charge of the situation as if he were more a rambo with an m16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him 52 pick up ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film trapping raimy inside mitchells jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by mitchell plays to an audience wanting the sweet revenge conclusion of a chuck norris movie not the intelligent balanced world of leonards book where mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way i left the theater shaking my head and depressed what a waste of talent
