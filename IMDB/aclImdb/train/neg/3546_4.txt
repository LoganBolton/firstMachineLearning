spoilers ahead  proceed at your own cautionbr br my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers  with relative ease  he continues to cave into their demands and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped he decides to wire his classic car up to explode with the money in it which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logicbr br okay so he wanted to keep his affair with cini out of the public eye due to his wifes involvement with the da campaign this i can see but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit or even kill them once hed determined there was no actual blackmail evidence eg cinis body this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 23 of it after that it sort of falls apart
