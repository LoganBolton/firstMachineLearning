david chases the sopranos is perhaps the most overpraised television show in recent memory not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion its devoid of a soul as anyone reading likely knows already james gandolfini is tony soprano a big fat ahole of a mob boss with a spoiled btch of a wife and two bratty shtbrained kids living in  you guessed it  the armpit of america thats new jersey by the way not only is tony a womanizing adulterer hes also an unrepentant murdering scumbag with a crew of saturday night live skitworthy caricatures for subordinates its not the fact that tony is a piece of sht mobster that offends me and apparently only me allowing characters to be who and what they are without judgment is something american tv hardly allows but chase  and his entourage of moneygorged emmygored writers  have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action  reaction reality of even obviously fictionalized organized crime a la the godfather instead chase glorifies and endorses his characters greedy violent and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony his wife and even his hairbrained psychologist do week after week or should i say month after month or is it year after year it seems like the shows paltry 13episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse much has been made of the series refusal to adhere to network structure with plot lines that go nowhere and characters that popup and disappear like backyard vermin but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure why does it always feel like im watching a soapopera tired mob clichés bored housewives selfserving irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere more than ever i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are pssed at this show its enough to make you want to curl up with a good book dantés inferno springs to mindbr br people on imdb love to claim that theres nothing good on television and therefore the sopranos is a breath of fresh air are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch the shield its included in basic ya know how about the still good the west wing or the brilliantly acted if erratically written boston legal what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades arrested development and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds  nobody has to watch anything new id much rather shell out 40 for an overpriced boxed set of well pretty much anything than give hbo 10 a month or 80 a dvd set to continue to prove how much of a hackfactory it can bebr br you want good television watch homicide life on the street or murder one or picket fences or even chases prior show northern exposure if youre already among the sopranoss legion of brainwashed fans and critics its too late for you but if not leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong  rotting with the fishes sleeping would be way too kind
