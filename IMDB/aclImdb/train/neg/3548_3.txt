for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline this one is for you from the bleak new york city atmosphere which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality this movie is a real downer br br why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned wanted to celebrate that fact filmmakers then were like an immature sixyearold with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store so hollywood gave theater viewers for probably the first time a dose of rape prostitution homosexuality child nudity homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealingand then awarded its work br br it also hoped im sure to shock mainstream audiences well it succeeded on that level audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time couldnt help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbagebr br forty years ago as a very young man i found this film fascinating too however seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again br br the acting was good but so what acting is good in many films nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldnt act hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wackedout people he was kind of like the johnny depp of his era playing guys like ratso rizzo in this film and then going to be the rain man later on yes ratso is a character youll never forget and joe buck voight is one you want to forget but the story is so sordid it overwhelms the fine actingbr br this movie isnt art and it isnt worthy of its many awards it only pushed the envelope bigtime in 1969 and thats why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics its two hours of profanity and ultrasleazy religious cheap shots glorifying weirdos andy warhol even gets in the act  no surprise and generally despicable peoplebr br i did like the catchy song everybodys talking that helped make harry nilsson famous but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better before nilsson did itand few people have ever heard of neil which is their loss and  as mentioned  the name ratso rizzo kind of stays with youbr br the film is a landmark but in a negative sense i fear this marked it as official that hollywood had gone down the toilet and it has remained in the sewer ever since
