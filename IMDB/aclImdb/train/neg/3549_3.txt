do you like stand up then stay away from thisbr br during the early rounds there are in fact good comics but unless they got some cute qualities they got a snowballs chance any controversial material and you are out and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians when i see who the crooked judges are letting inbr br 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries half of the finalists have given me 0 laughs several of them have lifted their material elsewhere something the judges doesnt seem to have problems withbr br it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have beenbr br if the producers changed the name of the contest to last clown standing all my criticism would loose validity maybe an idea
