i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for last comic standing if they dont have a good agent then they dont even get a chance to audition so more than 80 of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent if they do make it to an audition i was told that its predetermined if they get a second chance so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the usbr br if the comics do make it to the show then most of them dont get imdb credits i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of last comic standing and i dont get paid for doing the producers job its really a disgrace a month ago i asked last comic standing 7 on facebook why the producers arent giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this i just want people to know the truth i dont like seeing anyone getting exploited and thats why ive been helping the comedians comedians get exploited on hbo bet tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happenbr br please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvrmb4hyety
