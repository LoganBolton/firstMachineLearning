ive finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well it surely wasnt worth waiting all this time to see it the incubus is strictly bythenumber horror film unseen killermonster is raping and murdering women in a small town br br the film goes like this movie opens with killing then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another killing even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another killing surprising huh blah blah blah etcbr br the film is totally predictable from beginning to end even the stupid big redherring used throughout the movie wouldnt convince a 5 year old and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character so when the shocking surprise ending arrived i wasnt shocked or surprised in fact it was so funny that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie its so sillybr br anyway the film is so bythenumber that the rock band sequence is one of the few standout moments in this dreary flick its a standout scene not necessarily because its good but because its so funny and pointless the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock videolike moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theaters washroom by the incubus the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography which i actually liked but aside from that theres almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus except that its unintentionally hilarious
