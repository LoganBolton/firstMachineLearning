i rented this back in the 80s and honestly cant remember anything specific about the movie  only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen this isnt one of those it was so bad it was funny this isnt one of those it was so gory it leaves you with a bad feeling movies it wasnt even one of those what the heck was that movies i cant recall the performance of the actors but it was poorly shot the story was disjointed and it had no definable style when it was over i was angry that i had wasted the timebr br ive seen plenty of movies i didnt understand because of unfamiliar cultures styles andor storytelling but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties the incubus has nonebr br i actually contemplated not making a comment on this piece for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie
