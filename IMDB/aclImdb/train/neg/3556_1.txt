you know youre in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at halfspeed instead of fullthrottle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worstcase scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john houghs baroque art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rapemurders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly poed at times the incubus itself which doesnt show up until the last scene is a welldone creation but its not worth waiting forbr br 110
