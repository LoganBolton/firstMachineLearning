seriously i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood gore and repulsiveness but what really makes this film disturbing  uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women he john cassavetes of rosemarys baby talks about ruptured uterus dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish  sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine that being said incubus is an ultimately strange horror effort it isnt necessarily awful  although it isnt very good neither  but just plain weird the muddled  incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapistkiller of flesh and blood even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature and it never seems to stop introducing new characters none of these characters especially not the main ones come across as sympathetic and for some neverexplained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughterlove and continuously behaves like hes a suspect himself the towns sheriff john ireland appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesnt even seem to care about who keeps raping  killing the women in his district the female reporter is even too weird for words and the galens an old witch and her grandson are just plain spooky all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns women reproducing organs the sequences building up towards the rapes  murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling basically these are very positive factors in a horror film but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for incubus to be a really good film also there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through like footage of a bruce dickinson concert and the usually very reliable john houghs direction is nearly unnoticeable the final shot is effectively nightmarish though for me personally incubus was a bit of a disappointment but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80s horror to openminded genre fanatics
