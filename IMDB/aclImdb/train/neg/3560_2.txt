for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasiesfunny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anythingbr br i like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to its audiencebr br
