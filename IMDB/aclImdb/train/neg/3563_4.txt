fot the most part this movie feels like a madefortv effort the direction is hamfisted the acting with the exception of fred gwynne is overwrought and soapy denise crosby particularly delivers her lines like shes cold reading them off a cue card only one thing makes this film worth watching and that is once gage comes back from the semetary there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason it is absolutely bonechilling this film only does one thing right but it knocks that one thing right out of the park worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so
