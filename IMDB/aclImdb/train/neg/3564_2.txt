pet sematary  though a nice 80s horror movie with a nice director and atmosphere is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati its clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director the movie zeder was made before king wrote the bookbr br the cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary  but being stephen kind a famous american writer  its totally normal that he can get away with this  its obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no budget and in part its crap itself   but the original idea i repeat it its italian director avatibr br let the world know
