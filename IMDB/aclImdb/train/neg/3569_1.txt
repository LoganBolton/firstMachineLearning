wow only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar showgirls i mean where to begin the indescibably horrid theme song pia zadoras nonexpressions throughout the movie the fact that despite being set in los angeles aka land of the casting couch every single man and woman is fawning all over themselves to sleep with pia zadora by any contrived means necessary or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because theyre either mindnumbingly stupid pia or obvious despicable sleazeball everyone else and given that this flick was written by actual screenwriters sorta it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the moviemaking industry who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriterbr br but its unintentionally funny as hell though the breakdown scene alone will have you giggling and after seeing the climatic im not the only one who had to  her way to the top scene at the awards all done in the usual bargainbasement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as pia i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually reused that speech when she won her golden globe its fitting and that would totally make my daybr br anyway if youre a fan of bad tashy camp give this otherwise tacky movie a try
