the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker there are surprises twists and turns reverses and excitements at times this is truly an edgeoftheseat film but it disappoints and disappoints severelybr br the villain of the piece is not believeable his character does not hold together i refuse to spoil the film but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the endbr br the second major disappointment of the film is thatfinally it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the friday the 13th films not that every film need always be totally tasteful but this film does drip gore on occasionbr br though the film features the magnificent sean connery even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the paces
