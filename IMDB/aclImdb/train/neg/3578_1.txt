there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie they took a sleazy story miscast it miswrote it misfilmed it it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy storybr br as badly as it fails as art it fails even worse as commerce who could have been the target market for this what age group what interest groupbr br someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie that i would pay to seebr br ive seen thousands of bad movies and this ranks with sailor who fell from grace and manos  my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies ive ever seen everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with vandamme for all eternitybr br i challenge you watch this movie and perform an academic exercise  how could you take this and make it worse i cant think of one way
