the memory banks of most of the reviewers here mustve shortcircuited when trying to recall this cubic zirconia of a gem because practically everyone managed to misquote lloyd bochners walter thornton when in a fit of peevish anger he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife jerilee randallthornton a nearly comatose pia zadora which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the moviebut im getting ahead of myself in any case poor lloyd couldve been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his putupon costarbr br hard as it is for most of us to believe especially these days nobody in hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie this is certainly not the most defensible argument to make since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out but then again there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation from writing casting and direction mustve been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the ides of marchbr br the lonely lady is in that category and represents itself very well considering the circumstances here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen souffl√© pia zadora a marginal singeractress so determined to be taken seriously that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers which this movie most certainly did a somewhat highprofile novel written by the trashmaster himself harold robbins of the carpetbaggers and dreams die first fame a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all that they tried to play this dreck like it was clifford odets or ibsen plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck and was probably contractually obligated not to demand the use of the alan smithee moniker to protect what was left of his reputation like lamont johnsons lipstick meir zarchis i spit on your grave roger vadims barbarella paul verhoevens showgirls or the grandmammy of really bad filmmaking frank perrys mommy dearest the lonely lady is still oftendiscussed usually with disgust disbelief horrified laughter or a unique combination of all three yet also defies dissection description or even the pretzel logic of hollyweird nobodys sure how it came to be how it was ever released in even a single theater or why its still here and nearly impossible to get rid of but take it or leave it it is here to stay and i dont think that lovers of really good bad movies would have it any other way
