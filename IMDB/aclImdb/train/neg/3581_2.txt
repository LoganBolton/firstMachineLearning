i havent been able to decide if this movie is so bad its good or to quote enid coleslaw so bad its gone past good and back to bad again no matter it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird coloured vomit might and it offers up a number of scenes that you wont forget even if you want to theres a sneering young ray liotta telling a pigtailed pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis a bit later theres ray again molesting pia not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose theres a firm chinned pia telling her domineering mom that she wants to go to bed with rays geezer father walter theres the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by pia or anyone else wwwwhhhyyyyyyy theres that garden hose again as walter waves it pias face and roars is this more to your liking theres pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other masticating salad that they start tearing each others clothes off theres pia showering but forgetting to remove her dress perhaps best of all theres pias typewriter but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most afterwards i was afraid to open my laptop and finally theres pia at the awards exposing hollywood for the cesspool it is spitting out the second best line ever i guess im not the only one who has ever had to  her way to the top i see i have already spent more time commenting on the lonely lady than i have on far better pictures so ill quit be forewarned though that once you start watching you probably wont be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever
