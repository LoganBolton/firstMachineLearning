first off let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts so i have a softspot for fanpro stuff that means ill overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badlybr br so on to st hf well first off the good things enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles next the effects arent bad for a homebrew effort with nothing to make you really wince the stories arent too bad either nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing storyarcsbr br but it has a lot of faultsbr br first off although they quite obviously have to ripoff star trek footage set backdrops music and effects i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other scifi musical score ever made everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another likewise much of the footage is from other movies dutifully cgid over to make it look different the grey warships for instance though disguised are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers likewise sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage in one scene in either first or second season i think you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favoursbr br acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to grimace at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons theyve also made some interesting acting choices lets just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at thatbr br makeup effects are generally quite effective on the whole but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots they are just beyond unrealistic every time i saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that this is a stickup in one scene a cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these not only do the lips not move but the mask doesnt even have an opening where the mouth should be someone needs to be slapped hard for that couldnt they have taken a craft knife to it for goodness sake there are also some welldone but unintentionally funny makeup jobs such as the herman munster look alikebr br the writing though coherent is nothing new instead the script runs like a continuation of ds9 with the ships heading out from ds12 on various missions the new enemy the grey arent very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads ie starfleet meet the grey the grey are hugely powerful starfleet barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc all done before with the borgbr br another bone of contention is the dialogue star trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc in other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at handbr br the words are just gibberish really ive no problem with this but where sthf makes a mess of it is where they include realworld comments into this conceptbr br tactical advice such as we need to regroup sounds good but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group likewise when asked what the situation is a tactical officer is heard to reply we count three battleships he actually needed to count them cmon i expected the questioner to ask him are you sure or can you double check but my alltime favourite comment is this br br captain can we establish twoway communicationbr br comms officer no we can only send and receivebr br well duhbr br having said all the above the show does improve as it goes along seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad 3 shows an improvement but 4  5 are where it starts to get noticeably better season 6 so far looks quite reasonablebr br i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though quicktime sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to divxavi format the better some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor not only does quicktime make this difficult but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well in fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a tenthgeneration vhs tape copy the least they could do was to include a hires downloadable optionbr br anyway the show has promise and im even beginning to like some of the characters but thats 40 episodes on so im not sure this says that much about character development at allbr br but what can you say its freebr br ps out of 28 votes 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10 hmmmm were we watching the same show or are you 19 all three year olds
