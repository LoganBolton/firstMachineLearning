this is a german film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that i cant really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is i can tell you that theres several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the goth kitkat klub though and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film yeah there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires and theres some girl on girl stuff etc but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement i did rather like the eyerolling of one of the main housekeepersdevil worshipers that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evillooking was that wanda the evil lesbian as billed in the credits no matter if you arent too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies you might like this otherwise its pretty dull stuff and i couldnt even finish it i was so bored 3 out of 10
