i wasnt as lucky as some of the others commenting on this film i have never seen anything else out of theshall we say fecund mind of sarno i agree with many some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and gogo dancing are not really that attractive i kinda liked fraulein crankshe was so homely  she was cute the acting was pretty stale also though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem trying to follow the plot was a major chore was there one really i do heartily agree with one other comment for a vampire movie theres not much blood yep if you want good bloodsucking flicks check out such hammer classics as horror of dracula and my personal favourite brides of draculabr br the most unintentionally humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of batswhich you never seethe bats i meanbr br okay as a timewaster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the great white north but for heavens sake dont rent it
