to be as honest as i possibly can the devils plaything or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or is a complete bore the movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible there are great long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens characters just stand around with nothing to do theres no mystery no suspense and no plot points to care about the acting is simply abysmal most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera they do this repeatedly and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing while its not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead it comes close
