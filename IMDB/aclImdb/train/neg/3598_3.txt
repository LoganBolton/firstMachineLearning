do you know when you look at your collection of old videotaped movies and realize that there are some that youve only seen once or twice and you cant remember if theyre worth the time it takes to see them the alibi iswas one of those films i found it not long ago and decided i might as well give it a chance im not entirely sure if im happy with my decision on one hand the film is really really bad on the other now i have another free tape yeah you get it the plot is predictable and not in any way original the pacing is bad the acting is bad but thats not really surprising seeing as the two leads are former soapopera stars theyre used to overact the characters are poorly written clichés the film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress methrough film court scenes even those dont elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboardthin characters the film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever even the dialog is bad the thing is its so full of clichés that its laughable and thats the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 110 thealbeit unintentionally so comic relief of the many clichés and stereotypes i didnt pay very much attention to the film but just about every time i looked at the screen there was something to laugh at one final note i considered using the line tori spelling cant act as a one line summary but i guess everyone knows that so i opted for the current one seeing as its more informative all in all a thoroughly bad film but not the worst if youve got nothing else to do and if its on tv good for a few laughs if you can sit through it 310
