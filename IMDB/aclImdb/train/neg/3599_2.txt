umm i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marksbr br lets face it tori spelling is not a great actress and this movie just proves the extent of her talent the movies plot was weak i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom if there is a good thing about this movie i would say its that tommy chongs daughter just for the fact that shes his daughter and then there is that soapoperaish male lead whos decent good looks somewhat make him attractive but ceases to help his dramatic abilities why does imdb require at least 10 lines how many more ways can you simply say this movie sucks
