ive seen my fair share of badly thoughtout endings and final twists to films but i dont recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one didbr br the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey individually or collectivelybr br the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was illconceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously farfetched whats worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictablebr br harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie aint that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema
