a question for all you girls out there  if a man youve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out youd phone the police  yeah thats what i thought so i couldnt swallow the idea of marti gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of connor hillbr br  mild spoilers br br this is a really dumb story  connor hills wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is connor phoning marti so he can have an alibi  but theres a massive gap in logic here  couldnt connor have employed a hit man  something the prosecution seem to have ignored  and wasnt there any forensics at the murder scene  so why does the whole trial rest on connor phoning marti at the time of the murder  dumb  dumb  dumb  and its as predictable as it is brainless br br my abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter olympics marti gerrard is a really crap downhill skier
