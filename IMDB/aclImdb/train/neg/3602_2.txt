i am an avid brate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures so i have a substantial gauge to judge this film by it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980s has to offer it isnt as scary as night of the demons it isnt as gory as reanimator and lacks the camp value of theres nothing out there that being said this film has no value keep in mind the movie artwork is for a completely different film the stills shots on the back of the dvd box arent taken from this filmbr br violence  there is plenty of violence but weve seen it all before a murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilizebr br nudity none br br story  the story focuses on francine forbes  who wisely changed her name to forbes riley after this film was made  who accepts a job teaching at a university people start to die and forbes believes the killer is targeting her is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libidocrazed student to be honest it is impossible to care because the script doesnt flesh out any character outside forbesbr br acting  terrible on all levels this slasher has the feel of a school production high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does seminara as one of the students but everyone else is of the extras caliber of acting
