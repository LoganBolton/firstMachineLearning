back in the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics id like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parodybr br splatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch lets see if i can summarizebr br after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i dont recall the name but in honor of the title lets call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but dont hold your breath waiting for it theres a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then its back to the asylum and roll creditsbr br the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just doesnt make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving idve paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there aint no justice
