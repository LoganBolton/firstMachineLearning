this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen i remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason i thought i enjoyed it so like an idiot i ran out to purchase the dvd once it was releasedwhat a tragic mistake i wont even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow i am a fan of herschell gordon lewis so i am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level it is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possibleif that was their goal they suceeded if they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way shape or form that it is real then they failedmiserably avoid this movieread the plot synopsis and youve seen it
