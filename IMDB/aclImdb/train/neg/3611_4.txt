colleges high schools fraternities and sororities have been the most popular stalking grounds for maniacal madmen since the slasher cycle first became a popular cinema culture throughout the late seventies even backwoods cabins and campsites have rode shotgun to the amount of massacres that have taken place on campuses since halloween categorised the genre as a cult horror category from early entries like to all a good night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like urban legend or schools out theres usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the pipeline despite being picked up by troma  the titans of b movie badness  splatter university was heavily panned upon release and never really found an audience even notorious hack and slash websites like hysterialives have written off richard haines splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom i always approach criticised movies optimistically because theres often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly contagious like a dose of the flu which crowds the judgement of certain authorsbr br it begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his salts emerges yep you guessed it  an insane asylum it seems that one of the inmates has decided that hes unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore hes looking to take his business elsewhere the unseen nutjob makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate orderly where the sun certainly doesnt shine he obviously favours the dress sense of the murdered worker so he takes the liberty of borrowing his uniform blood stained trousers and allbr br three years later we transfer to st trinians college an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests a teacher is busy after hours marking her students work when all of a sudden theres a knock at the door before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap this of course means that theres a vacancy at the university and so were introduced to julie parker francine forbes the lovable replacement for the recently departed lecturer it seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds barred slaughterthon before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade suspicious suspects abound but can professor parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another statistic br br im not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available the uk altered video was released under the alias of campus killings but the us copy that i own states that its the complete unedited edition which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere id be fairly surprised if that was the case as splatter university certainly isnt as goredelicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe one or two litres of corn syrup certainly dont stand up to gore hounds scrutiny when compared to the likes of blood rage or pieces so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped one thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from francine forbes who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the 79minute running time despite amateurish direction from richard haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer unfortunately that possibility never came and bottom of the barrel bombs like death ring and splitz certainly didnt help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarshipbr br the rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of grease or the wanderers the bog standard point and shoot direction couldnt have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in haines slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion lets just say that its not a final that i was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cyclebr br at one point in the runtime one of the teens says man that parker bores me to tears well the same can be said for splatter university which never lifts the pace above slow motion with that said though francine forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that i would have paid to watch again in a similar role so that pretty much sums up this untromatising ride slow paced shoddy but still strangely alluring youd have to be especially forgiving to give it a chance
