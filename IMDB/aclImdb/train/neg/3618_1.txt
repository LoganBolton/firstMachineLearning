clich√©ridden story of an impending divorce  or is it  through the eyes of a 6 yearold child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red herring zombie subplot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or dramaticallybr br does noone teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak storyteller  when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement  just end the story im compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place br br good but wasted debut by child actor anthony de marco  the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why noone watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back
