basically theres a family where a little boy jake thinks theres a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the timebr br this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombiebr br ok first of all when youre going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing  arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spotsbr br 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them
