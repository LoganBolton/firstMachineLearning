after reading the book i loved the story watching the movie i was disappointed that so many changes were made it is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories only the names and some of the books story remained read the book and youll have a better understanding of the movie the book gives you a better development of the characters these characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them the locations were indeed in line with the books descriptions some characters not included television has microwaved so many great books and stories this is a perfect example of that input from the author doesnt always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes
