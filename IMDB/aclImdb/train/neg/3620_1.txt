i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with druginduced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not childrenbr br it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmates drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough ill grant you but still acceptablebr br then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two booksbr br so this sevenfoot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despairbr br and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and dopedup dragons is added to the mix of mayhembr br the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo  of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nosediving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i dont know where i would have preferred to livebr br in summary this movie is terrifyingbr br if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy
