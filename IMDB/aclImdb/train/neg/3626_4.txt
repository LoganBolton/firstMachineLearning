i dont know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i dont think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and shes not good looking at all its a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadnt been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now im not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her im just saying it because i think thats what the worse part of the movie is shes probably a good actress but i cant tell because i havent seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but im telling you youre way better off watching singin in the rain
