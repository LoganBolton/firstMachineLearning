im never much for classic films movies like patton going my way how green was my valley the godfather casablanca annie hall gone with the wind lawrence of arabia and citizen kane bore me however i would much rather watch any one of those films 3469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever if i did the latter id probably be sleeping the entire timebr br the color art direction and the music didnt interest me gershwin or nongershwin the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep the dialogue doesnt match up to singin in the rain basically this movie is boring the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid but you cant blame me i only slept 5 minutes the night beforebr br 1 star10 too bad we cant give zeroes
