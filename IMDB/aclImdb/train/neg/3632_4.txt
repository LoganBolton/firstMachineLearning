nb spoilers within assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that directors mind but directing a wagner opera is an especially tricky task as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold hansjurgen syberberg loads this filming of parsifal wagners final masterpiece with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams you get more than a piece of the director you get the whole fatted hog and then some syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of german history but does it work to meld that desire to a wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts br br the scenes with the knights of the holy grail in acts i and iii are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism these are drawn come from wagners own time from long before and go well beyond if you know what these things mean they can enrich syberbergs vision for you but not necessarily enhance wagners vision if you dont know what they mean theyre simply confusing if not annoying i wont bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here suffice it to say it is a typical wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements in this case a blending of the holy grail legend with the principles practices and pageantry of christianity the theme of redemption plays the main role here as in nearly every wagner operabr br i personally had to sweat to get through syberbergs first act amidst my jarring acclimation the music saved the day but act ii picks up the pace here we meet klingsor the evil sorcerer out to entrap the wandering innocent fool parsifal the greatest seductress of them all kundry will be used to entice him to the dark side after an initial dalliance with more symbols these get stripped away and the long gorgeous transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off finally the film starts working a genuine magic and it is chiefly due to syberbergs choosing to set things naturally and simply suddenly the acting starts to work the expressive actress edith clever and the luscious soprano of yvonne minton team to create a wondrous kundry suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters the camera work stays simple and quietly fluid in other words wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms and it works beautifully for me it was the most engrossing part of the filmbr br with the reentrance of the knights in part 2 of act iii the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in some other loony syberberg ideas using a huge wagner deathmask as a major setpiece causing the composers protuberant proboscis to loom comically large dressing the act iii knights in all manner of costumes wigs and makeup what is the director saying that the knights are a bunch of buffoons that they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions its anybodys guess the insertion  just after the incredibly touching baptism of kundry by parsifal  of rearprojection footage of the conductor rehearsing in modernday realism his orchestra in the studio this completely snapped my dramatic thread requiring a few minutes to regroup the complete avoidance of having any time pass between acts ii and iii when we meet the knight and narrator gurnemanz again he should be an old old man and parsifal should reemerge as a worldweary but wiser middleaged man but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the parsifal character into malefemale components some find this the most brilliant stroke no doubt i can credit karin krick who plays parsifal 2 with acting of strength and dignity she also happens to be the best lipsyncher of the whole cast but pleasewagners conception of parsifal is already so complex his growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past to his breakthrough realization in act ii of what amfortass eternal wound means and how it has become his own to his return as the great redeemer of act iii  this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character the bisexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd and whats with this nonsense about a homoerotic gurnemanz and parsifal cant we just accept a mentorapprentice relationship which is marvelously reversed in act iii br br the monte carlo philharmonic under armin jordan plays with passion and beauty though the chorus is disappointing but after watching this film i only wanted to whip out my soltiled recording highly recommended and get my wagnerian bearings straight again the film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating to syberbergs credit hes created a visually arresting work and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera but instead of sticking to parsifal he seems to have wanted to bring in all things wagnerian the man the life the enormous influenceall of it in crude symbolic code parsifal the opera is already full of weighty symbolism the grail the spear the holy sacraments baptism amfortass everbleeding wound klingsors selfcastration the kiss kundrys curse and on and on this is not to mention the musical symbolism sounding constantly in the score in the form of wagners leitmotif system parsifal itself is one huge symbol getting back to my firstparagraph question syberbergs whole hog is all way too much for me but if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy then go for it i wont recommend just staying away from this you may find yourself heartily satisfied or if you need something to crack your wagner barrier try itbut please please dont stop here parsifal is in a late very ripe league of its own
