i am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring filmbr br often with foreign films i skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming absence of action as many of the best international films do not live up to the western hollywood model of cinematic storytellingbr br i enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of clich√© in the foreign film arena i enjoy that many foreign films dont tie things up in a neat palatable little bowbr br that said this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time i wasted watching it no meaningful character development no engaging story arc no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen br br synopsis a bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the houseboy finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her br br while the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario i was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it and i wouldnt have even done that were it not for the positive ratings br br unless you have an academic interest in the period i strongly suggest steering clear of this one
