i had no background knowledge of this movie before i bought it but it sounded cool and ive been wanting to see a really kickbutt viking movie for awhile now alas this film was not what i was looking for i had hoped for the best but instead was delivered a boring nordic soapopera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time the films premise is intriguing enough its about a viking warlord who defies his god and odin is so enraged that he curses the warlords son named barek to death and rebirth as a berserker this barek guy is then forced to live enraged insane and violent lifetime after lifetime the movie is filmed competently enough with some rich cinematography and quasigood performances by the actors but again i found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end the filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semiunique but they dropped the ball perhaps it couldve been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore i mean we are talking about berserkers here arent we vikings were supposed to be bad enough what with all the raping and pillaging so arent berserkers supposed to be even more extreme all in all unless youre a fan of the young and restless etc or are yourself in fact an insane berserker who likes self torture id probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid
