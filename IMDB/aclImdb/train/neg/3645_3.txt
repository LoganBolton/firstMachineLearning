a youth gets a bad hair day goes out on a hill and falls into where he cant escape then he meets mr atlas a mythological dude from 2000 years ago as his very best friend and an arnold schwarzenegger lookandsoundalike his herculean strength helps the boy out of danger and later adjusts to modern life so whats the big deal this is the lousiest idea for a family outing either way this one shouldnt have been attempted at all really our fictional character of might and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe to add to the blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing and before you know it there is some attempted violence that doesnt qualify this as family entertainment the scene where atlas complains of his undershorts is gaggling though just spend a nice quiet afternoon in the park for a change
