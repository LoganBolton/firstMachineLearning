its a good thing i didnt watch this while i was pregnanti definitely would have cried my eyes out andor vomit it was kind of gruesome mainly disturbing i personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little wayhowever as a mom i cringed when beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when virgina aborted the child during her 3rd trimester with rusty utensils no lessalsoas an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulphoweveras creepy and sinister as the baby was i was rooting for it to liveand as twisted as the movie was i am extremely intrigued to see the sequel
