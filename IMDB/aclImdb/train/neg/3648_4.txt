a childless couple brooke adams jeff hayenga go to a doctor james karen to try to conceive it works but adams slowly becomes aware that theres something seriously wrong with the babybr br pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy scriptthe basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end i saw every twist coming the direction is poorhe seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene the production values areto be nicelousy very shabby and the gore scenes are too unpleasant i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach with lousy special effects the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this filmbr br some good acting makes it somewhat bearable adams hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknownits easy to see why i give it a 4
