this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified of course there probably wouldnt be an xfiles if this show hadnt prepped this audience for it so well darren mcgavin is not exactly the superheroic type but he is a plausibleenough guy to deliver heroic deeds check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents here he is the main attraction there doesnt seem to be a girlfriend or wife whos a distraction in fact there isnt a whole lot of sex appeal to the show something im noticing as well is that the pacing isnt really suspenseful in a typical way theres a lot of throwaway humor to this show sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax theres a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his seriocomic tone
