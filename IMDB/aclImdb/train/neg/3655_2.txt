oh my i think this may be the single cheesiest movie ive ever seen im serious this is one of the ultimate bmovies the first proof is that it isnt a 5 dvd oh no thats too mainstream for this i got this on vhs from a bin full of exrental videos at my local video storebr br if i may quote the blurb in 17th century japan there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages his name was mayeda he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5000 muscats from the king of spain whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan it then goes on to say a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continentsbr br i must have seen a different movie this was no epic and it certainly wasnt a multi million dollar anything no shogun mayeda is really just the crazy adventures of the engrishspeaking mayeda sho kosugi he isnt even a shogun really but thats not important what is important is that he does a really cool impression of john cleeses repeated charging of the one castle in monty python and the holy grail and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers awesomebr br the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugis engrish accent the movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever delivered by the coolest engrish accent ever and honestly do you really want anything else you could fast forward shogun mayeda to the end and replay kosugis final line over and over the tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line awesomebr br 210  so very very cheesy
