i must admit that i have been a sucker for samurai flicks since i can remember i used to watch rather indiscriminate be it elitist works like the seven samurai or the bloody comicbook variation like lone wolf and cub i also liked usjapanese crossovers like the bushido blade and of course everything containing sonny chiba and hiroyuki sanada and ive virtually watched every samurai at least twice but not kabutobr br in 1993 i first watched kabuto on video that even samurai films can be boring in the beginning i was looking forward to mayeda reaching europe and the confrontations that would come from that but by the time he actually reached spain i really didnt care so much for the movie anymorebr br it wouldnt do the film justice to call it bad technically its a clean entry into the genre but there is simply never quiet enough sho kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a fraction of above mentioned japanese actors charisma and speaking of sho kosugis son kane who appears in almost all sho kosugi films as shos son he has inherited littletonone of his fathers limited acting skills adding to the minuspoints is the absence of the blood and gore that until then was a trademark of all samurai film this was obviously intended for a younger us  european audiencebr br lets just say that its a soso film for the average historicactionadventure fan but a bore for hardened fans of samurai cinema fans who are into the samurai meets Â…genre should rather go and watch red sun 1971 featuring charles bronson as cowboy who has to team up with samurai toshiro mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from badguy alan delon it pretty much how to do it right and where kabuto went wrongbr br so even though the film is a mere 100 minutes it seems like a much longer filmbr br the reason i gave this a honourable 410 points instead of 310 first time i saw this film i saw it in the german synchronized version in this version kosugi can actually be understood i must admit that his engrish is at times funny but gets tiresome after about 30 minutes
