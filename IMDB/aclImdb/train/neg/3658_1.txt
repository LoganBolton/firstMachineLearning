despite some mildly thoughtprovoking oddities in the script and the films overall curiosity value fury of the wolfman emerges as a dull uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess perla cristal the rest of the players including the hammy naschy are a complete writeoff though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolffrankensteindr moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies the plot is so unevenly developed the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous at least in the english version that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashedbr br zabalzas direction seems jerky even amateurish his staging is clumsy and ineffective he is not helped by villasenors overbright lighting even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the directors few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advancebr br other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude though the stridently overemphatic music score and the laughably crude totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation
