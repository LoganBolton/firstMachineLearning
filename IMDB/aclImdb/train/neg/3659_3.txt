this review applies for the cut of the film thats generally available as fury of the wolfman i understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as fury of the wolfman in short the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever it is utter nonsense and incomprehensible nonsense at thatbr br waldemar daninsky that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by paul naschy in a seemingly endless series of films is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to tibet where he was attacked by a yeti somehow this has turned him into a werewolf daninsky is a doctor a scientist and an instructor at what appears to be a college one of his female colleagues ilona elmann is involved in a vague form of hypnosischematodes a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victims head ellman feels this will enable her to change the direction of the human brain naturally enabling her to rule the world provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no troublebr br elmann is also into werewolves because she kidnaps daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory she has a bunch of other people trapped there as well some of them look like gypsies and are chained up being in varying states of lucidity others are clearly hippies elmann feels that one day she may be able to help them be human again  but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes waldemar becomes her hairy hit man wandering around like a werewolf zombiethat is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another naschy werewolf film frankensteins bloody terror dont ask at which point naschys werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animalbr br is this making any sense no good thats the films saving grace it doesnt try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up fury of the wolfman may be the best halloween party movie ever you absolutely do not need to pay attention to it and in fact if you do you will be completely confused
