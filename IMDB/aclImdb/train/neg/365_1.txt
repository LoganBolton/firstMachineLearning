bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourthrate spoof of springtime for hitlerbr br the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the originalbr br if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls
