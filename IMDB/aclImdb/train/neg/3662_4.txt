la furia del hombre lobo forms a completely standalone storyline which doesnt seem to fit in at all with the previous waldemar daninsky movies some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of werewolf shadow although it was released afterwards  they may be right im not sure anyway in this movie waldemar daninsky is bitten by a yetilike creature in tibet great dialogue here  it was a yeti but thats impossible im a scientist and these things dont exist it was a hallucination thats all and although marked with the sign of the pentagram he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted its not long before hes resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control he is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animalsbr br first of all  jacinto molina paul naschy whatever you want to call him hes a fine actor and cared passionately about his work no matter how flawed these movies are you can always rely on him for a decent performance the rest of the cast seem good enough but its hard to tell when they have a halfassed voiceover dubbed over all their lines and that was really the main problem for me  many of the voiceover artists they used were just awful awful awful whenever i chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines they seem to constantly refer to the hero as waldeman but unfortunately its almost impossible to find subtitled copies of naschy movies although theyre sometimes available in the original language without subtitlesbr br the directing of jose maria zabalza seems sort of hitandmiss  there are some great visual ideas in some scenes while others are badly constructed and poorly edited particularly in the final scenes when it really counts the reason for this was that zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set he allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite molinas dialogue used extras without his permission and spliced several shots from molinas earlier movies all of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of molinas best works and its no surprise that the two of them never worked together againbr br but its not all bad news as there are some good ideas here some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage the werewolf as a yeti idea is one that returned in molinas later work some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar and theres also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where daninsky runs from house to house through a village slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes  one scene is particularly intense but its actually lifted straight from molinas first movie la marca del hombrelobo along with a few other shots i actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining although there are some problems with the front row entertainment version such as pretty obvious cuts although some of it may simply be due to the directors lack of continuity gods knows what omissions there are  ill probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the futurebr br this is a overall a decent piece of vintage naschy which experienced fans might enjoy but it could have been much better and so probably wouldnt make a great introduction
