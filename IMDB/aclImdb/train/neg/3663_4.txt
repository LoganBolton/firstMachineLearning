spanish horror icon paul naschy stars in this one of his weakest werewolf films but bear with me for a moment most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title the fury of the wolf man and there have been many home video versions of it over the years if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though the most workable edition ive seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps and its an unedited and complete european version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from furys print it is also letterboxedbr br naschy plays waldemar daninsky returning home from a trip to tibet only to find out that hes contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair he takes care of her and her lover while in animal form but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant apparently the doc attempts to tame the werewolf and there is a very strange sadomasochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged daninsky who is under her trance at least in the original version ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as daninsky battles a shewolf br br the biggest problem with the movie is that the director according to naschys claims was often drunk and the results are indeed rather incoherent when watching the wolf man never sleeps copy its not quite as difficult to make out whats going on though the editing remains atrocious in spots worst of all is occasional nonmatching footage of naschys ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film la marc del hombre lobo aka frankensteins bloody terror and mixed into this one without any sensible reason the wolfs clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again as does his demeanor one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from fury next he is growling and running around savagely from bloody terror really bizarre
