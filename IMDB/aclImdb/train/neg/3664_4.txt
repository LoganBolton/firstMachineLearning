waldemar daninsky paul naschy travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti which causes him to become a werewolf he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover and is later revived by a female scientist dr ilona ermann who uses him in mind control experiments daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctors failed experimentsbr br upon hearing of naschys death from colleague jon kitley i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch in my scramble i found i own not one but three copies of fury of the wolfman the film is of questionable video quality the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times and the american versions have two love scenes removed quite frankly without a remastered uncut copy i wasnt really getting the proper movie in all its glorybr br this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky i suspect this is true but you wouldnt know this from the film itself the plot is confusing at times and theres really no indication that this is a sequel if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box youll see that im not alone in my confusionbr br perhaps the films shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through while floating around for years it was only released in 1973 due to problems involved in finding a distributor and naschy said in his autobiography that the director zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him those really arent light accusations and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalfbr br chances are sooner or later youll come across a lowgrade version of fury of the wolfman it appears in a variety of threepacks and box sets so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know what really needs to happen is an american uncut version with a decent sound and video mix and the love scenes thrown back in as far as i know this does not exist let us honor paul naschys legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves
