apparently this is what happens when a director allows his 14year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime as i said earlier although ive always wanted to catch one of paul naschys werewolf pictures this atrocity served as my introduction and as awful as it most certainly is i still intend to pursue other entries in the series albeit very graduallybr br despite some high profile disappointments like joe dantes the howling 1981 i love werewolf pictures in general but to be honest i quickly lost interest in this films plot and just stood there gazing at my tv screen counting its absurdities as it were there were far too many to mention them here but i have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf persona ie going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed zombielike state in the very next one  as if hes on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to bootand yes i did know the reasons for this beforehand as well as the phantom of the opera look of the wolfstein character but what do i know  perhaps the elusive fulllength version of this mess could very well have been a bonafide horror classic
