opening scene explains why hurt is later immune to the contaminated man too bad it doesnt explain anything else how did he get whatever he caughtwhat was itwhy does it work so fast then we go to present day budapest ok was the opener in the past or the future it turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning sorry i should have paid closer attention huh or maybe its just badly done then a lot of confusion about the different jobs hes had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him aha so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects he must have been one of the top guys hes friends with the c e o of the chemical company for god sakes then theres the substance itself technically a poison but it mutates in immune carriers so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an allergic reaction all very different things in real life magically its not contagious from one dying victim to another only from the carrier how convenient then theres the h a z m a t protocol they jump into a situation without having any idea whats in store or how prepare for it did the producers not have enough money to show a proper washdown after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all
