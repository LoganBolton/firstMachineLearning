i really cant think of anything good to say about this filmnot a single thing the script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference youd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad ill just stop now its all bad 210
