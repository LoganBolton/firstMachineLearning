bad actors bad filming choppy dialog shallow characters but then again it was a bad premise in the first place basically an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal of course the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house cash a check for 1000000 dollars and even foil three bumbling idiots reminiscent of the three stooges br br preston blake is an annoying obnoxious boy who decides that when written a blank check by a complete stranger he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can in other words he wanders into a bank br br hands a teller a check he makes in his printer and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10speed could not catch him even when preston jumped a row of carsbr br of course with every hokey adventure movie there has to be hot heroine in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston and promises another date when he turns 17 br br however the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting nor its sloppy dialog such as the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up its butt and then pick up the fur it was rather the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people  what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias macintosh to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts of course the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston who uses his 11year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face then treat her to hamburgers finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettisons from the ground our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two as they make their way to prestons limousine complete with a 1dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke onbr br overall 110 is incredibly gracious for this film i dont see how it only has a 4410
