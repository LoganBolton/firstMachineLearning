note i will reveal a key part of the plot but if youve looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material youll already know itbr br this movie seems to have been written by an elevenyearold who isnt very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it the writer doesnt know the difference between a chemical and an organismbr br forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they dont wear protective gear not even gloves these are quibbles in the context of this movie in the scientific world within this story 22634 and gravity goes sidewaysbr br the fact is that the people in this movie do not with a few exceptions behave the way human beings behave almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate the love story of course there is one makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespearebr br i cant believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing
