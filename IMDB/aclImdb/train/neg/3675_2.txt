really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i havent seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you dont use a spoiled citybratlook in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy weller is germanbr br 210 because the photography could be worse
