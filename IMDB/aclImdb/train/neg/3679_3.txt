this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here its a pretty film with nice visuals featuring the scenic beauty of hawaiibr br however that was the only redeeming quality for me the story was generally boring who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her picture husband is a lot older than he advertised he was granted that could be a bummerbut get over itbr br only in the last 10 minutes does she do an aboutface and become fond of him by then for most viewers it was too littletoo late wed fallen asleep by then
