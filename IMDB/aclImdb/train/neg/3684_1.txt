they sell it as a horror movie its supposed to be a thriller but i found it pretty funny comedy dont think so i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot i dont blame the actors i think they were not very good but ok i think cillian is a very good bad guy i loved his acting in batman beggins and rachel mcadams whoa shes a beauty and a good actress as well but lets try to be a little objective here the story mm mm the direction mm mm it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie but theres one good thing tho its a short movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes for me it was like 10 minutes under the waterbr br i just dont know why this movie is rated so high and in rotten tomatoes even higher whats wrong with good rational and objective criticism
