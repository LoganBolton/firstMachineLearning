the main reasons to see red eye are rachel mcadams who delivers a stellar performance and jayma mays who is wonderful as the assistant hotel manager on the other hand cillian murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish the rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes on which i will elaboratebr br please do not read further if you dont want to know what happensbr br here is a synopsis of the plot rachel mcadamss character lisa manages a hotel where the new hardnosed homeland security director plans to stay that night rachel is returning to miami from a funeral but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves in the meantime someone is stationed outside the house of her father joe played by brian cox ready to kill him if cillian murphy jackson calls all lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the directors suite to one where jacksons cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile from a fishing boat to kill the director and his familybr br so here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidencesbr br 1 jackson finally convinces lisa to make the call and in the middle the phones in the plane lose their connection lisa tries to fake that she is making the call but coincidentally a guy across the aisle from jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead jackson catches on and grabs the phone from lisabr br 2 at one point jackson headbutts lisa and she of course gets knocked outbut only for 30 minutesbr br 3 jackson catches lisa writing a note on the mirror in the extraordinarily large lavatory and he bangs her around a bit miraculously the only one who hears anything is an 11yearold girl whose word of course is discountedbr br 4 lisa stabs jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing steals his cell phone and makes a mad dash for the exit fitting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat the flight attendants oblige lisa by opening the door to the jetwaybr br 5 ok all those are reasonable if not highly unlikely but heres where it gets really stupid lisa gets into the terminal at miami airport and there is no cell phone signal every major airport in america has great cell phone receptionbr br 6 she runs through the airport with jackson in hot pursuit and no security officers even delay thembr br 7 jackson who lost lisa in the airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat but he can still be somewhat understood however he doesnt bother to call his man outside of joes house ps there is no train at miami airport but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the orlando airportbr br 8 lisa steals a car and rides away of course this time when she goes to make a call the cell phone says low battery and soon shuts off when will they stop using this inane plot devicebr br 9 while the phone still said low battery lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the director had been moved of course they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite thereby negating the need for the whole lisajackson plot whats the story here was the directors original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view nevertheless everyone gets out just before the missile hitsbr br 10 lisa drives to joes house to save her father only to see the killer outside although she runs him over as he is shooting at her by crashing her jeep into the house no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop bybr br 11 jackson arrives at joes house and knocks him out we dont see howmaybe another head butt he then explains to lisa that he didnt kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see lisa die first give me a break what is this saturday morning cartoonsbr br 12 for the rest of the movie about 20 minutes jackson chases lisa around the house and she resourcefully fights him off of course a real killer ie one maybe played by jason statham would have done away with lisa or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer in the first 30 seconds during the course of this chase jackson steps over joe at least once without bothering to kill himbr br 13 finally jackson prevails and he is about to kill lisa when you guessed it he is shot by joebr br so heres my suggestiontell wes craven to stick to horror or maybe he should get together with michael bay who directed the equally stupid the island and make red island
