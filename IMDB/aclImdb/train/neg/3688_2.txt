as usual i went to watch this movie for arrahman otherwise the film is no good rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure after this he delivered a hit with chandramukhi i am eagerly waiting for his forth coming shivajibr br i have read the other users comment on rajni i found it interesting as the user is from tn too rajni is one actor who acts i think from his heart not from his mind he is not a method actor like kamal hasan i think we need to appreciate rajni for his strong going at his agebr br any ways i need to fill 10 lines for this comment so wish u good luck rajni
