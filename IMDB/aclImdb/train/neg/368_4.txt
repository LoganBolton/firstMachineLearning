this movie is really goofy i saw it as an 11 year old and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 i really didnt care for it but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of such as 1does money buy happiness 2should i lie to my parents about things i think they wouldnt approve of 3does money buy friendships 4is money everything 5shouldnt i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me granted these are very unrealistic situations but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children maybe they should watch this video as well in order to showscare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt
