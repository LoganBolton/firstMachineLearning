not the best of actors moviesthe director has concentrated on projected actors stardom rather than giving a good entertainer may be hero himself his family and his sincere fans can enjoy itbut definitely its not worth for neutral audiencethe fight sequences are a total comedythe dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic the music is averagethis film was the biggest flop for the actor inspite of the hype created over the movie the movie failed miserably dont even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time you can watch some cartoon insteada good movie buff cannot digest this crap for 2 12 hours
