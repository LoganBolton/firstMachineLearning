i did not expect much from this film but boyoboy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you cant get the feeling that his caracter is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if its drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and morebetter humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they dont show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh
