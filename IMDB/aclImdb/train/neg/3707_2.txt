this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen yes its even worse than dungeons and dragons and any film starring kevin costnerbr br chris rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film and his supporting actors didnt even look like they were trying to act chris rock is a wonderful standup comedian but he just cant transfer his talent to this film which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picturebr br if you havent watched this film yet avoid it like the plague go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wallbr br for chris efforts i give it a 210br br
