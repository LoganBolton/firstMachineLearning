blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless its overtones of lonliness are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere 300 grand the notion let alone the bargainbasement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers please respect your intelligence and dont watch this awful awful film
