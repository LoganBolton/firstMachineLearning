i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie instead i based my judgments on a friends opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy but this movie just falls flat on its facebr br during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one and it that endeavor it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward luckily but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern not much of that in the moviebr br the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole some parts were discontinuous altogether if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didnt do a good job the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes which were dry and dull rocks first incarnations couple of underlings were also bland if theres one thing they did do right though they made rock seem funnier by comparison
