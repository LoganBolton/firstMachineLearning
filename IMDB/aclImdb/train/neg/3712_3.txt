when i first heard about down to earth i was pretty excited im a pretty big fan a chris rock he was especially hilarious in dogma but this film proved to be a disappointment chris rocks performance was not nearly as good as his past performances and the movie was just very badly directed as a wholebr br first off chris rock he plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine obviously this works fine in the scenes where hes supposed to be doing standup but in the rest of the movie it doesnt even when hes talking to one other character he seems to think hes trying to make a roomful of people laugh he has a few funny moments but they mostly come during the standup scenes no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian as for the rest of the cast theyre pretty much there just to give rock someone to talk to none of them stand outbr br also the movie was poorly directed the movie has basically a onejoke plot old white guy acting like a young black comedian while i prefer movies with more than one joke this still could have worked and been quite funny the problem was we saw too much of rock and not enough of the old white guy its supposed to be funny because its this white guy telling chris rocks jokes but for most of the time we just see chris rock so its not nearly as funny the few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like rock are in fact hilarious if he had been shown more the movie would have been a lot funnierbr br overall a few moments of laughter cant make up for the fact that down to earth is poorly acted and poorly directed this one was a pretty big disappointmentbr br rating 410
