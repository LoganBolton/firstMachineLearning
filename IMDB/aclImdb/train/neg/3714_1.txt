this movie is a rewrite of the 1978 warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the standup comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with gods representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in beattys movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellingtons house during the murder the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multimillionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real white wellington fail miserably improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot  which in itself did not masterfully portray the lifeafterdeath idea  but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth
