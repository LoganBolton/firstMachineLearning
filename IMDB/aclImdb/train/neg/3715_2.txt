black guy becomes rich white guy and rich white guy seems to embrace hiphop culture and most of the funny moments of this film play off of this the problem i have is that it doesnt work and almost never worksbr br ok so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles wellington that would be too much to ask ill grant that but at the same time it goes too far the other direction im supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things playing like hes a bastion of hiphop culture and people just accept him and what about sontee who falls in love with him as a rich white guy even though she doesnt care about his money or power this is so completely unbelievable its not even funnybr br i just couldnt suspend disbelief and i couldnt finish the movie i added one extra star because it did make me laugh even hard a couple of times but i just couldnt get get past the whole white guy doing hip hop thing that has never been well done in any movie ive ever seen that tries it this was no exception
