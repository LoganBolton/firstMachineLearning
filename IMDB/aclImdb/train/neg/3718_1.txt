chris rock deserves better than he gives himself in down to earth as directed by brothers chris  paul weitz of american pie fame this uninspired remake of warren beattys 1978 fantasy heaven can wait itself a rehash of 1941s here comes mr jordan lacks the abrasively profane humor that won chris rock an emmy for his first hbo special predictably he spouts swear words from a to z but he consciously avoids the fword anybody who saw this gifted africanamerican comic in lethal weapon 4 dogma or nurse betty knows he can elicit more laughter with the fword than martin lawrence and eddie murphy put together sadly despite a few witty oneliners down to earth hits rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romancebr br down to earth utterly destroys any good will that the weitz brothers generated with their landmark grossout face american pie this disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable colorblind interracial romance unfortunately a more than competent castamong them the full montys mark addy chazz palminteri of analyze this sctvs eugene levy and newcomer brian rhodes as charles wellington jrare wasted in flatfooted sketchy roles hardcore rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken abysmally written by lance crouther ali le roi louis ck and rock down to earth casts chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the big apple and gets booed off the stage at night in harlems celebrated apollo theatre poor lance barton chris rock suffers from severe stage fright nevertheless his charitable manager whitney daniels frankie faison of hannibal sticks with him through thick and thin after lance learns the apollo theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza he implores whitney to get him in the lineup excuse me but if lance is such a deadbeat standup comic why does the apollo keep inviting him back meanwhile fate has something else in store for lance while pedaling home on his bike our protagonist spots a pretty lady sontee regina king of jerry maguire crossing the street but he doesnt see the bus that collides with him and kills him wham lance barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head in heaven which resembles a cruise ship nightclub lance learns that an overzealous angel mr keyes eugene levy of stay tuned timed his death 40 years ahead of schedulebr br heavenly honcho mr king chazz palminteri of analyze this gods righthand guy apologizes and escorts lance back to earth the snag is lance cannot reclaim his corpse so he must inhabit another body the best that mr keyes can come up with is ruthless white 60year old tycoon charles wellington wellingtons adulterous wife amber jennifer coolidge of american pie and his unscrupulous personal aide winston greg germann of sweet november have just tried to poison him reluctantly before wellingtons body vanishes lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until keyes can locate a more appropriate body meanwhile lanceaswellington encounters sontee again she is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor while regina king brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with wellington although he is no longer black lance not only tries to woo sontee but also win a gig at the apollobr br down to earth features rock in his most unfunny role the comedians reason for making this movie seems questionable reportedly he ate lunch with warren beatty and told beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist elaine may had penned for beatty initially beatty tried the racereversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast muhammad ali in the title role of heaven can wait the deal fell through and beatty headlined the movie himself according to rock his longtime cowriters and he thought that they could annihilate this classic moreover he justified his choice of heaven can wait based on his philosophy to do something you can only do when youre hot earlier rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing as a lifeless comedian in down to earth rock doesnt so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst this halfbaked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the weitz brothers you know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes only the laughter similarly the casting of mark addy as wellingtons butler who speaks the queens english but is in reality a commoner from michigan defies logic too addy is an actual englishman and he doesnt have to fake an accent his accent is genuine the major overriding quandary with down to earth is the onagainoffagain lookalike switcheroo that the characters make so chris rock doesnt disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds although chris spends half the movie as white guy wellington audiences see him largely as lance undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky baldheaded caucasian white alterego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hiphop lyrics incredibly rock served doubleduty as the films executive producer and one of its four scribes the mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward misguided muddle of a comedy about the only redeeming feature of down to earth is jamshied sharifis superb orchestral film score
