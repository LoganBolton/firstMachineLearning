imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara cartland there thats what happens with this filmbr br the opening showed promise but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another rehash of misunderstood brooding badboy andrei meets innocent whimsical beauty paula br br rather than waste any time in creating an original premise the filmmakers went straight for the moneyshot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty thence follows a string of insincere and heavilyclichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophicalpoetic fluff andreis admission of being eponymously a poet is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a byronic hero should have  but even when were told in heavy underlined writing who and what he is its still difficult to believe it  or carebr br for a byronic heroantihero to work the story needs subtlety style and innovation  all of which are utterly absent here this is not a modern day phantom of the opera its just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic dates a bad man who after meeting her seems as dangerous as bunny slippersbr br the performances might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and otherworldly no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor dougray scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part this is not his best work the glimmers of interest were brought by jürgen prochnow as vashon and andrew lee potts as the young photographerbrother a better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead
