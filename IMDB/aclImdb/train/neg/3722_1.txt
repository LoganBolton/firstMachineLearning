i remember being forced yesliterally forced to see this film by a southern baptist preacher when i was a kid and even then i loved its awfulness its designed to scare poor suckers into being saved the only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real lifebr br check out the chapter on this film in sarah diamonds book the politics of the christian right fascinating and certainly more interesting than the movie
