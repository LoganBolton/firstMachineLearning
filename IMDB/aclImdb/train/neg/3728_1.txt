as some other comments show this movie might scare you when youre a little child and that is probably all that it is good forbr br however if youre older this movie only does one thing suck majorly and thereby i dont mean the acting its soundtrack cutting or sth like that im simply talking about the plot if you can call it that br br spoilers ahead br br i dont want to give any more spoilers than necessary if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie but if you graduated from any school this is just a big insult of your intelligence when watching this i was stunned most of the time because what was happening was just that stupidbr br this includesbr br the forming of unite an evil unassociation br br  we are just supposed to believe its evil is it even evil at all if so why is it evilbr br the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo br br  there is no necessity to impose this on the people so why the hell no pun intended are they doing it br br inviting christ to your heart merely as lip service br br because theres nothing anybody who in this movie is considered a real christian ever does besides saying that stupid prayer sojust say that prayer before the rapture and youre saved  no matter what br br thus rating 110
