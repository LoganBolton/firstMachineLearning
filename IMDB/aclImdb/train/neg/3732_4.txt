perhaps because i was so young innocent and brainwashed when i saw it this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me i havent seen it since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now however i will say that it left an impression on me and most of my friends it did serve its purpose at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions i was particularly terrified of what the newlyconverted postrapture christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast i dont want to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it so i will not mention details of the scenes but i can still picture them in my head and its been 19 years
