actress patty duke wrote an insightful funny roughhewn book about her career as an actress her crazyquilt lovelife and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good with this rich material to draw from and patty playing herself in the final act one would think a crack tvdirector like gilbert cates could bring it all together on film but call me anna is a pale shadow of dukes autobiography for those who havent read the book the sketchy narrative leaping forward in time isnt absorbing we are never allowed to get our bearings with whats happening and the production seems stunted by a low budget the actors are miscast and the value of having duke herself finally appear does not pay offthe films phony reality is so thick at this point that patty cant bring stability to the scenario it appears as if the producers were sincere enough and consciousnessminded to anxiously steer the film towards dukes ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process
