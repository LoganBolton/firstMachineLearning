thats what the title should be anywaybr br this movie combines guns explosives and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie let me make my point in a series of questions answers type dealbr br what happens in the movie people diebr br is that it yesbr br what is the plot about what plotbr br what is the point the movie is trying to make killing is the only solutionbr br what are the characters like extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalitiesbr br is there anything good about this movie yes im sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming itbr br if you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie if you happen to be repulsed by such lowstandard entertainment then made men is not for youbr br to sum it up the plotline stinks the characters arent worth their while the storyline is completely resistable and nothing fits togetherbr br this proves one thing the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly arent made
