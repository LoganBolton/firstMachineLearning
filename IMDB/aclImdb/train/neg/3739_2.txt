so this was an hbo made for tv movie eh is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive shot at survived lies beaten up survives shot at lies and so ad infinitum call that a script as for the brits embarrassing to see timothy daltons pathetic or was he just taking the p depends how much he was paid i guess attempt at a southern sheriff as for that other brit the bleached blond one what a wer there is a trend towards glorifying these english speaking sic superviolent thugs lately perhaps thanks to mr madonnas two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour like pulp fiction does however this movie discredits and devalues the genre definately one to miss
