blank check is a movie that i saw on tv one day and like most movies they air on tv blank check wasnt that good first of all no one i have ever met has seen blank check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s also blank check wont be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixars films i wouldnt call blank check a bad film but its not really entertaining either or at least it isnt to anyone over the age of 6 blank check isnt a entertaining film because nothing about it is original everything just makes you go what havent i seen this before blank check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from richie rich to home alone which strangely enough both have macaulay culkin in it blank check isnt a bad movie but it deserves to fade into obscurity
