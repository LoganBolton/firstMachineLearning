right away this film was ridiculous not that it didnt have redeeming aspectsÂ… for example the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery anyone not living on the east coast should know the south doesnt have beautiful mountains like those found in the west i knew it was utah right off the bat but perhaps dalton couldnt suppress his english accent so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town subverting his accent into a southern one was easier sure the film has plot twists but its phony sense of place was something i couldnt get past its not like utah doesnt have meth labs so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me br br one other thing in action pictures always puzzles me why do they always make the cocking sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun it seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a chukchich signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire of course the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary br br lastly the pyrotechnics were way over the top but hey this film was targeted to a certain market segment i suppose its too bad each of the actors can act but this film was lame
