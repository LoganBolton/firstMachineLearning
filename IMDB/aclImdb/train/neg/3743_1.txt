jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machinesbr br but then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for successbr br diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if 150 europeans can defeat 20000 native warriors and 400 nonmilitary south africans can defeat 10000 zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeedbr br he says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know real numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history br br he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories hes reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point
