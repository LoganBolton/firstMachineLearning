but this just isnt working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good on what grounds there are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is selfindulgent and unconvincing lynchs movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that there is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc but this is dull and yes pointless because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too farfetched or simply told before in a superior manner its just lynch exploring dv nothing more so it should be treated like this 110
