wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first filmmakers attempt at making a pseudo art video br br to give you a couple of examples br br 1 david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content blank walls up shots with ceiling in the background br br 2 david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video cameras hum br br in fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie unlessbr br this is a joke on davids part to force fans search his website for hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny
