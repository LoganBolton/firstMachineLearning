i am a huge fan of david lynch this film however was a quite disappointing experience apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that ive come to associate with lynchs work the visuals are dull to say the least and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interestbr br this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director ive seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camerawork scenery sound and script this film lacks almost all artistic qualities i feel as though im watching one of davids home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends
