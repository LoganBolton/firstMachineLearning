i grew up watching and loving tng i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldnt be more stark the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand rikers character which is how it probably would have been treated on voy they could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips the in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as clich√© in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on bar none worst episode ever
