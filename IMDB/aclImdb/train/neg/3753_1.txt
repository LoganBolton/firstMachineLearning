because of the 1988 writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days its pretty much crap consisting of repeat cut  pasted clips from season 2 and was described by its writer maurice hurley as terrible just terrible br br why the producers couldnt just wait to shoot something decent who knows im guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this halfassery this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur dr katherine pulaski on the series
