i loved this movie ill admit it this has to be the best straight to video movie ive seen well me and my friend decided just for shits n giggles that wed rent this movie we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected plus more when that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the sasquatch we literally watched that part about three to four times it was that amazing hysterically of course and why oh why does the main character have to roll that much like honestly we know that youre in danger rolling that much isnt gonna help all that much but really if this movie is in youre local video store rent it it is worth the money and its not even that bad like its bad but not incredibly bad overall complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie
