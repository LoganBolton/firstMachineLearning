oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kongs love childit totally took away from the believability of the characternow i knew there wasnt a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoonso from then on the whole movie was shot for methe money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match hisi am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch huntersmust watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie
