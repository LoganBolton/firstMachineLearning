two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie sue in the panorama program with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part its a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is compensated by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue extension du domaine de la lutte which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we cant sympathize with our hero how he is called by the storyteller because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself own fault im sorry i cant understand him not enough the writerdirectoractor want us admitting to him that its not his destroyed selfconsciousness or the passivity of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we wont follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didnt notice yet its a quite depressing filmbr br in the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed perhaps its too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesnt know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie doesnt follow this path but handles his characters with helplessness nobody believes that our hero is able to instigate tisserand for a murder too dull too kind too  passive not to mention tisserands complex he has an inhibition but he couldnt be of course a murderer of women to finish there are women and the world its not a device of a modern sexualized society help you as you can but dont follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which announces bankruptcy to human relationships without seizing the real conflicts within
