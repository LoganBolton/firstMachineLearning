foywonders review of this cheap stv hits the nail squarely on the head make sure you read it in case you dont a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific northwest to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard the big foot family doesnt take kindly to this and proceeds to pick off the team one by one largely offscreen big foot himself has a distinctly apelike face but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the hendersons most of the movie has the wooden generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away this is a nobudget movie in which very little happens at least on screen we do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches but nothing comes of this
