i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks id have to say i got my moneys worth on this one i had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras well as meatloaf said two outta three aint badbr br the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies ive seen or maybe ive watched so many low budget movies recently ive lost perspective there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part its of at least high school play levelbr br the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the secondworst part the first thing i thought when i saw it and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me was that a man in an ape suit would have been better clunky stopmotion animation would have looked betterbr br so you may be asking why i call the cg the secondworst part thats because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects they are loud annoying and constant ive been camping i know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud theyre not deafening like the cacophony in this movie usually when the background sounds drown out the movies dialogue its a bad thing but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film i wasnt missing muchbr br the action was infrequent and boring the tension was nonexistent as was any sense of empathy with the characters speaking of the characters they were all cookiecutter and bland the only mildly engaging byplay was betweenactually i cant think of anything there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about itbr br the cinematography was decent a step or two above what youd normally see in a movie like this however it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer br br if youre like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it otherwise stay away at all costs
