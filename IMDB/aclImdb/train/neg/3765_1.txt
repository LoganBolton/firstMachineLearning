i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent this one caught my eye it was the worst 450 ive ever spent and i want my money back please dont waste your money on this this was one of the cheapest movies ive ever seen the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didnt even watch it all the way through i just got fed up with it the acting was horrible the effects were horrible everything was just really bad and tasteless it all added up to be a really bad boring movie and total waste of time and money i hope that one day theyll make a good movie about sasquatch but until then ill have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece
