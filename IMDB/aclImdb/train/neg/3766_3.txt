i went into watching this movie knowing it wasnt going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i dont mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean awful special effects the acting wasnt too bad but wasnt good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some halfass cgi ripoff only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints it is much better
