budget decent actors who knew these things were important dont waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap ta and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutesbr br the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before hats offbr br if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didnt come from frogballs community theater
