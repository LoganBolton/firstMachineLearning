thats right a movie written directed and produced by fred tepper and family fred should have known better having worked the sets of titantic and dogma br br so the plot there are some scientists and some forest rangers and a hot chick with huge fake breasts they are all really bad at their jobs including the hot chickwho i think is supposed to be a photographer but who cares because she wears a bikini one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are professional people which is good because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoksbr br they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange apelike bones and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie we all hope he dies real soon along with his sister whos meant to be the cute naive one but is really just annoying then they gasp find a sasqu i mean apelike animal burial ground of course no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones theyre messing with i guess scientists and forest rangers just dont think about those types of thingsbr br then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh who died in an unfortunate trout accident all over againbr br insipid boring dialogue i zoned out several times inane plot unlikable characters bad cgi a man in a monkey suit would look better and acting that just wasnt very good all add up to make a movie i wont be watching againbr br you check it out though its good for some unintentional laughs
