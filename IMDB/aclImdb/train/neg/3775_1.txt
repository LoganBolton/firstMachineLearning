as other viewers have mentioned this film was an interesting experiment in photography the colors are comic book bold i think the director got carried away with his artistic vision over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content despite its stellar cast the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get prerelease press a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album im breathless music inspired by the film dick tracy which was a stratospheric hit due in large part to the inclusion of dancehit vogue  which is not in nor has the slightest relation to this film id guess the major portion of money from this film came from tieins to madonnas im breathless albumbr br if you watch it at home by endtitles youll think theres two hours out of my life id like to have back save yourself the wasted time  do not bother with this
