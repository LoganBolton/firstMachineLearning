flat soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film absolutely nothing takes you by surprise you can even tell when the bryan adams vocals are going to come in which are always at the wrong timebr br the main character spirit the horse is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening the narration is not needed though as everything happening is really obvious you can even tell what the horses are saying although all they do is neigh which would be good but all the horses make exactly the same sounds  one for warning one for sorrow one for laughing etc there is no variation between the horses voicesbr br young kids might like this film though its soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch and theres little danger of anyone being frightened if you have nothing else to do and want to watch a film with your kids this isnt a bad choicebr br but otherwise this isnt recommended
