heres the good news first spirit is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release the artwork and effects are revolutionary and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alonebr br and now for the bad news i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it you may remember that spirit got badly trounced by lilo and stitch last summer the first person who argues that it was because disney is more wellestablished and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled why lilo and stitchs script didnt stinkbr br for all the incredible new animation technology on display in spirit the story is almost astonishingly dull there is a lesson here and needless to say it doesnt just apply to animated movies you can have the most mindblowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal but if your story is boring and more importantly we dont care about your characters its bad filmmaking simple as that the animation is still mindblowing i just cant wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it
