spoken like a true hardboiled uan gangsta the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or goodfellas it is not in the same leaguebr br but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake uan accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia but their steenky accents spoiled the funbr br ah well the script aint too hot either don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and patting him on the back all the while
