i must be that one guy in america that didnt like this movie i guess this just wasnt my style or something i just dont see whats so fascinating about it this was barely entertaining let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history br br its about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord pretty simple way to describe an entire movie and thats exactly my feeling about the entire movie contrary to what a lot of people think just because a movie is about mafiasdrug tradecriminal groups doesnt automatically make it a great movie dont forget good storytelling
