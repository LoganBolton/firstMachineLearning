this contains spoilersbr br i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is and being french it tries for depth by being enigmatic nothing really makes any sensebr br léo is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is hiv positive the youngest brother marcel has not yet come down to breakfast and the first thing the family does is decide that at 12 years of age he is too young to be told maybe if he was four or five but twelve the first totally unbelievable thing is that the family doesnt even ask where or how he got the virus how long he has known about it nothing is asked they only worry about marcel finding out this is a very close knit provincial family but although they decide not to let marcel know about léos hiv positive status nor the fact of his being gay the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions how many families do you know where the parentsbrothers wouldnt have at least some reaction to one of the members announcing that he is gay here nothingbr br léo decides that he needs to go to paris to see his exlover and he decides to go on the trip with of all people marcel do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover again totally unbelievable especially since marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality if this is the way the family has decided to let him find out it is rather brutal and again unbelievablebr br léo goes to find his lover aymeric at his work in a paris bar the owner says that aymeric will not be there until the early evening but why would léo want to see him at work why not phone and arrange to see him in some place more private where they can really talk why not go and see him at his home but no léo shows up later in the day with marcel in tow and is surprised when aymeric doesnt just drop everything to go walk with him for 5 minutes aymeric tells him that he is no longer available that it was léo who left him and that léo hadnt replied to any of his letters léo says but i love you and then wanders off but if he really loved aymeric wouldnt he have at least told him about his hiv status to warn him to get tested and maybe get medication this would be the least he could do  but not a peep he leaves and doesnt even warn aymeric that he might have contracted the aids virus this is totally irresponsible of him  and of the filmmakers this film was apparently made for a french tv series for young people  it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible well not here i guess every man for himself is still the french way of doing things another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the touchyfeely aspect everyone is always leaning against someone caressing someone or kissing someone inside the family and outside the family i have never seen anyone in france be this physical never mind an entire family seated at the breakfast table one 17 year old brother has his leg perched on the lap of his elder brother and the elder brother is caressing his leg as everyone sits around discussing something how many brothers do you know who are that physically close in another scene the same 17 year old comes into marcels room asking whats the matter cant you sleep then takes off his clothes and completely naked gets into bed with his brother and snuggles up to him as if they were lovers this and another similar scene between léo and marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film sorry again i dont believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothersbr br the only good thing i can say about the film is that the actors are all quite fine especially marcel in the main role but it wasnt really enough hiv and aids are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light at the end of the film the family has gone to the cemetery to bury léo but once again marcel has been left out of it  he has been left in the care of a cousin i think nevertheless he sneaks out and watches the funeral from afar is this what such a closeknit family would have done it is totally inconceivable that they would not have included him in his brothers funeral it was the last scene of the film and it was the last straw for this viewer
