 but the keyword here is usually i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb but in the world of brated movies this one is zrated absolutely ridiculous the thing i respect about most of my favorite brated movies are that they dont take themselves too seriously the makers of movies like that sortof treat the movie lightly even if its a heavy topic i get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a 10star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots nevertheless despite all this i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars as i am biased towards movies like this if youre a brated fan however i would try too hard to find this one
