i dont really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film its an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level its completely amateur  constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clich√©d the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i dont want to be too harsh ive made my share of student films and they were all awful but theres no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see itbr br safe assumption that  much like the cast  positive comments are filmmakers friends and family
