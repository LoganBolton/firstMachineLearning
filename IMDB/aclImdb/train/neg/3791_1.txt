i cannot vote on this because i wouldnt watch garbage from these people they got my money with another movie mr jingles and i swore it would never happen again i feel its my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time one guy even responds to himself using the same name there are shills in the forum that say its as good as shawshank redemption and citizen kanenot even close by no means if this is the companys 2nd movie it should be better than the first that means the 3rd movie should be a lot better not so ive seen it all i want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is finebut dont try to market that trash
