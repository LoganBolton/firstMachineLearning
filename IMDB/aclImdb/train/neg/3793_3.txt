the nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet it bears little resemblance to eta hoffmans original story on which it is basedbr br in the ballet the story is essentially over by the secondhalf when clara or marie in this version travels to the kingdom of sweets to watch a series of character dancesbr br theres an infinite variety of stage productions that reinterpret the story in myriad ways not always successfully to compensate for the ballets weak librettobr br balanchines version doesnt really have any sense of drama or story at all despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in tchaikovskys wonderful firstact music the result is a completely forgettable firsthalf christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing the little that there is of it isnt particularly memorablebr br the pantomime overacting particularly of drosselmeier which might look passable on the stage just looks silly filmed for the big screenbr br unfortunately things arent much better when we get to the kingdom of sweets act ii in the stage version although there are a few choreographic highlights most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring this certainly isnt vintage balanchinebr br balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance but i have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets watching this film version of his stage production of the nutcracker has only reaffirmed this view
