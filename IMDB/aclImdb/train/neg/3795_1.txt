i really wanted to love this show i truly honestly didbr br for the first time gay viewers get their own version of the the bachelor with the help of his obligatory hag andra james a good looking welltodo thirtysomething has the chance of love with 15 suitors or mates as they are referred to in the show the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesnt know this if james picks a gay one they get a trip to new zealand and if he picks a straight one straight guy gets 25000 how can this not be fun take my hand lets stroll br br the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body the one youd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me god knows theres so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tvbr br aside from his rather average physical appearance james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk even as such he has this arrogant smugly condescending aura about him however if james were standing up against a blank white wall hed meld right into in it i honestly cant recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show he is that boring and forgettable in fact one of the mates flat out advised him he wasnt feeling a connection i thought that was the best part of the show also james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt sound feminine or sound masculine but dont ing segue tones in the middle of sentencesso painful to sit through i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hagbr br then we have the suitors a remarkably bland bunch of men who dont seem to care either way what is happening equally vapid they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair again astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles it wouldve been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones however in all their banality they still manage to upstage james which isnt all that hard to do anyway slightly that is you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man very sadbr br also i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys br br dont get me wrong im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute its just that overall they were just blah compared to the men youd see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorettebr br i dont know how many times i hit fast forward during this show i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box i can accept the mundane apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little no such luckbr br if youre expecting drama intrigue sexiness or excitement you will be severely disappointed the biggest drama comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york how scandalous as titillating as that may be i guarantee you that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this showbr br sure there is the twist but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you youll easily discern whos who it wasnt hard at all i was only wrong once this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere elsebr br we get to watch as james  co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance shopping for gifts visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke yawn sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway thats one of main problems with the show no one seems to be enjoying themselvesthey are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lamebr br finally the physical aspect is not there theres no cuddling no caressing no kissing  no endearment of any sort its just ok that was a boring date im gonna go back to my ugly tacky wannabe sydney operahouse dwelling quick peck on the lips cya this show is so ing prudish its ridiculous i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men but come the  on people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses this show refuses to compromisebr br sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling to summarize my three points boring  boring  boring  go do something else youll have more fun waiting at a doctors office for an appointment at least they have interesting magazines there
