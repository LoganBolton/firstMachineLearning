and that is the only reason i posses this dvd now i havent seen the first nemesis film but i did check the info out of it and i here by say what why because in the first film alex was male but then again the first one was set in the future so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time who knows at least it wasnt addressed in the film in any waybr br heres a quick summary of the plot alex still a baby then or how ever you want as it was is in the future escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80s africa there mommy gets killed and alex sue price grows up in a african tribe then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg so there does sound familiar doesnt itbr br terminator isnt the only film being ripped here predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie the vincent price one gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head frombr br lets see what else okay the film was quite standard small budget flick but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90s film it would have looked okay for a 80s flick how ever biggest problem is the plot things just happen and the viewer is barely interested nemesis 2 isnt the crappiest piece of cinema ive had pleasure  to watch but it does come damn closebr br i wont say a thing about acting because lets be honest here did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here oh well at least i did find sue price hot in that amazonian warrior waybr br a real movie rating 210 there isnt a lot of pros about the over all quality and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sensebr br a camp movie rating 410 i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film so it does have small merits in it
