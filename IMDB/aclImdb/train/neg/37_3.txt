devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that its on the dpp video nasty list but it really neednt have been many films on the list where there for god and dpp only known reasons and while this isnt the tamest of the bunch there isnt a lot here that warrants banningwhich is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that its on the shopping list the plot actually gives the film a decent base  or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films  and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle a hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself the devil hence the title the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really arent many scenes of interest its a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z venus in furs faceless and she kills in ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say ive seen everything on the dpps list just two more to go and im guessing thats why most other people who have seen it saw it but if youre not on the lookout for nasties there really is no reason to bother with this one
