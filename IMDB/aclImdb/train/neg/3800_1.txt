naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task candidates being so abundant but nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since i saw it it was so funny we had to rent it again the next day and again i laughed so hard i was literally rolling on the floor this usually only happens when i see monty pythons scott of the antarcticbr br throughout the whole movie an overwhelming whattheheckfeeling firmly grasps the viewer im utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage its supposed to be a sequel yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film the hero has the same name but this time alex is female although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing what with all the muscles and the barbariannomad outfitbr br there is really no plot at all its merely a prolonged chase scene only its so slowpaced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is there is almost no dialogue which is just as well considering the quality of it and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions without ever really explaining what it was all about luckily it never gets boring because theres something silly and phony going on at all timesbr br terrible movies are usually just tedious but nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of overseriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that its truly entertaining rent this film or buy it even you wont be disappointed
