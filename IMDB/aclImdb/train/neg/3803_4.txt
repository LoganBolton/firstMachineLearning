the movie seems disjointed and overall poorly written the screenplay moves along as if 10 different people wrote it and none of them were communicating with each other apparently they wanted to take a page from a miracle on 34th street the original type film but it is done in such a poor way that the movie falls apart this film is for only the very young and even they will see the fact that whoever scripted it knows little to nothing about baseball such as br br  when the angels are in dead last place the owner doesnt seem to care nor is he bothered by the fact his manager just got into a fight with his pitcher  on the mound  or that he punched the teams play by play announcer on live tv however when the team is one game from winning the division he gets bent out of shape over a story sourced by a 6 year old that the manager is getting help from a kid who claims to see real angels what sounds worse a losing violent out of control manager whose team has lost 15 in a row or a winning coach on the verge of the playoffs that is acting a bit eccentric and is helping foster kids the owners reaction makes no sense and hes moved to change his mind by maggie and her straight out of cliché land speech during a news conferencebr br  the angels are supposed to be playing for the division in the final weekend series against the white sox however at the end of the game the announcers keep saying the angels won the pennant the pennant is not decided until someone wins the league championship not the regular season division titlebr br  whitt bass the goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the angels losing streak  then is the starting pitcher  the very next daybr br  mel clark tony danza is said in the ninth inning to have thrown 156 pitches in a lowscoring ballgame typically in low scoring games the pitch count is much lower than this usually around 8090 pitchesbr br  al the angel says at the end championships have to be won on their own even though he and his angels have been manipulating and fixing games throughout the whole second half of the seasonbr br i could go on and on as there are many other examples where the story is poorly writtenbr br for younger kids under 10 this movie may be entertaining its too bad  done right this could have been a classic done wrong like this and its a forgettable mess that will forever live as a uhfcable saturday morning washout
