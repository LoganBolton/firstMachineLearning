my wife and i both thought this film a watereddown madefortv bbc version of manhattan murder mysterywhich is itself good but not great the story has little inter character tension or chemistry and not much of a plot woody allens character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth and hugh jackman and scarlett johannsson dont have a lot more to do its pretty disappointing i must say ian mcshanes role is just an expanded cameo appearance br br the first thing that occurred to me was i wonder how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to dislodge him from manhatttan he mustve needed the money and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars im giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise if you ever want something to have on while youre knitting or sorting your stamp collection thisll do the job i wouldnt pay to rent it again
