warning this review will reveal the ending of the movie scoop if you dont want to know how the movie ends dont read this reviewbr br scoop is so bad youll think annie hall was a flukebr br it gets one star because you get to see hugh jackmans naked chest thats the only thing scoop has going for itbr br woody allens misogyny and his fixation on women young enough at this point to be his granddaughter has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any pointbr br the plot seems promising a ghost ian mcshane directs a fluffy headed student scarlett johansson to investigate whether or not an english lord hugh jackman is the notorious tarot card killer of prostitutes a magician woody allen helps the girlbr br promising plot notwithstanding the movie completely lacks charm or humor or atmosphere its an amazingly leaden amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film never mind dozens perhaps allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the pressbr br much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films woody allen now a septuagenarian has finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girlbr br not so in fact the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no onebr br there is an early scene where johansson for no reason central to the movie allows herself to be gotten drunk and seduced by a powerful older director seduced is a euphemism for what happens its a slam bam ive gotta go kind of moment it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever and it cheapens johansson in the viewers eye why did allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie because it shows a powerful director  like allen  having sex with the female lead allen gets to have his cake and eat it toobr br johansson is not yet an actress she doesnt know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight low cut top she imitates allen in a couple of scenes and that just looks weird and sadbr br it doesnt help that her character is scripted as a doll who cant function without a ghost or an elderly and less than aweinspiring magician telling her what to do at every turnbr br she is approximately half jackmans age and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes togetherbr br audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines and jackman deserves better too  a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency and an actress who can convey those qualitiesbr br hugh jackman is similarly cheated by the script allen apparently cant stand it that jackman is so stunningly good looking and young and so he gives jackman nothing to say or do like johansson he is used merely for his good looks this is a shame because as jackman has shown in any number of productions from oklahoma to x men he can actbr br heres the big plot twist  jackman suave charming english lord really is a killer so though the movie says it is all about letting someone else other than allen get the girl she doesnt get anyone jackman the man shes been making love to is a man who murdered a prostitute nice woody nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your graspbr br in a passive aggressive touch allen deprives his heroine of his own presence as well killing off his character the magician leaving scarlett johansson all alone at the end of the filmbr br a final note at my screening not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy
