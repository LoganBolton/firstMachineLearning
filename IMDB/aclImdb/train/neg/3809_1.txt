this show is just annoying i feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny especially bob saget the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the awwww track comes up at the most unnecessary times the overdramatic kids are no exception especially the olsen twins also this show is cliché city if you were to look up the word cliché it would read full house every story line has a life lesson to be learned at the end a sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness gasp too bad this couldnt be possible in real life i dont know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track i find myself yelling at the tv saying that isnt funnysadcute if life were really like this the world would fall apart
