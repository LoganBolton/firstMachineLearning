i can see little girls enjoying this show but calling this a family show is ridiculous im amazed how well remembered it is after all these years its an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wifes brother and his stupid friend from school and others as the seasons go on all of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson in the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke as for the actors i didnt like them either bob saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities dave coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid and hes horrid john stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him the oldest girl dj on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever the middle girl stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister the youngest girl michelle showed what bad actresses the olsen twins were you can always tell when they are switching them off the plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid its cringe worthy this is a family show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much this will be remembered as my least favorite sitcom from the 80s and 90sbr br my rating terrible show tvg 30 mins
