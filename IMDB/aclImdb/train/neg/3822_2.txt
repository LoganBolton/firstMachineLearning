to be a buster keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis most of us first encounter keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production the general the navigator sherlock jnr we recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy and we want to see more of his movies here the heartbreak begins after steamboat bill jnr keatons brotherinlaw joseph schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put keaton under the control of mgm keaton became just one more actor for hire performing someone elses scripts then his alcoholism got worse after steamboat bill jnr keaton never again made a truly firstrate film a couple of sources describe a wouldbe masterpiece comedy that keaton claimed he almost got to make at mgm a parody of grand hotel biographer tom dardis has offered convincing evidence that keaton made up this storybr br the heartbreak increases because among the many years of keatons long steady decline he just occasionally came up with a good film  such as his short comedy grand slam opera i continue to search for the lost footage of keatons dramatic scene with spencer tracy in its a mad mad world a sequence in which embittered cop tracy telephones an old retired crook keaton and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing smiler grogans cash that footage is almost certainly gone forever but i keep lookingbr br speak easily alas is one of keatons films from the beginning of his decline mgm were trying to build up jimmy durante who coincidentally played smiler grogan three decades later as a new comedy star unfortunately mgm tried to build up durante by teaming him with keaton whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with durantes im a fan of both throughout his career durante was a merciless scenestealer commendably he knew that he was being built up at keatons expense and keaton was the only costar whom durante never attempted to upstagebr br keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations in speak easily he plays a didactic and humourless midwestern college professor named post because hes as wooden as one who receives a letter informing him that hes inherited 750000 which he must travel to new york city to claim does he make a phone call to verify this does he even check the postmark no he takes his lifes savings out of the bank and rushes to new york as soon as hes gone posts manservant confesses that he wrote the fake letter to jostle professor post out of his rutbr br post who thinks hes a 34millionaire crosses paths with jimmy dodge durante whos trying to produce a musical revue but hasnt any money the characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh keaton is playing one of those eggheads like mister logic in viz who intellectualises everything durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang theres a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which durante is trying to talk to keaton about money but  instead of coming straight out with it  durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like kale cartwheels and so forth  while keaton of course has no idea what durantes on about ill give keaton credit his own dry and dusty prairie voice his flat kansas accent is absolutely perfect for the character hes playing herebr br sidney toler looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled on tick by professor post henry armetta whom ive never found funny is even less funny than usual here offering a running gag with a stupid payoff thelma todd impressed me here in a more villainous version of the role she played in horse feathers a much funnier movie edward brophy one of my favourite character actors is wastedbr br part of the problem with speak easily is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways keatons lawyer shows up at durantes theatre with an urgent message for keaton  but he isnt there so the lawyer proceeds to divulge keatons personal business to the first total stranger he meets fire that lawyer buster in another scene professor post  the guy whos perceived as bankrolling this musical  blunders into the chorus girls changing room and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves i know for a fact that modern chorus girls would never react this way and i seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either  certainly not in response to the angel controlling their shows pursestringsbr br spoilers coming about half an hour into the unfunny speak easily the great jimmy durante seats himself at the piano grins into the camera and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune this is the moment when i thought that at long last this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us alas no most annoying of all is the ending of this film which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of screen directors playhouse chaplin had already used it in the circusbr br i very nearly wept  in anger and sorrow  at the wasted opportunities in speak easily mostly out of respect for the work that keaton durante toler brophy and miss todd have done elsewhere ill rate this movie 2 points out of 10br br
