for most younger viewers out there they probably have no idea who buster keaton was so because of this they probably wont feel nearly as sad when watching this film as i did i happen to be a silent comedy freakhaving see just about every keaton film still in existence my being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish this is because during his silent days keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian he was amazing in his physicality and his films were almost never dull however in a move that movie historians still are baffled by at the end of the silent era keaton gave up his independence and became a stock mgm actor instead of being a great creative force mgm now saw keaton solely as an actorand they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great at first these films with mgm were not that bad such as the cameraman but with talkies the studio really blew itputting him in several films with jimmy durante durantes humor was based on his gift for gab and was abrasive keaton in contrast was quiet and based on action two more unlike and incompatible actors would have been hard to find as a result of this deadly combination keaton made some truly dreadful filmsbr br now this isnt to say that speak easily is a terrible film no instead its just more of a timepasser and an amazingly unfunny one at that in fact if you go into the movie assuming its a comedy it will probably make the film harder to enjoy instead its sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements it is not a film that will produce belly laughsespecially for keaton fansbr br the film begins in an odd setting keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching he knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books in a bizarre move keatons servant tricks him into believing keaton has received 750000 from a dead relativehoping that this would spur keaton to get out and enjoy life this is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work not terribly well but it worksbr br keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to new york to have some fun on the way there he meets up with an incredibly untalented theater troop because he knows nothing of the world he doesnt seem to realize they stink and because he thinks hes rich keaton decides to take them all to new york to perform on broadway however just before the show opens his friends find out that keaton is not rich so they decide not to tell keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show they assume that if the show is a hit then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy however they forget that the show itself stinks what are they to do and will keaton get the nice girl get roped by a gold digger thelma todd or be flat broke and alone if you care see the filmbr br as for keaton he has few stunts in the film though there are some dandy ones near the end instead keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner theres really little to love about this film or hate its just blahwhen it should have been a heck of a lot better
