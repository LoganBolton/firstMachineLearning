i feel the movie did not portray smith historically the goal of this movie was to tell smiths life in a way that would be comfortable to the lds church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern the movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of smith as a man i have taken it upon myself to study smiths life and have read both lds works and none lds works the movie like most lds projects was beautifully filmed and well acted however this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of mormonism or smiths relatively short lifebr br a significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that smith had when he was seven while this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith another point is in portraying smiths teen years the film is silent regarding the smith familys involvement in magical practices during the 1820s another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith goodnaturedly entering into wrestling contests it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violentbr br i could go on and on this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment
