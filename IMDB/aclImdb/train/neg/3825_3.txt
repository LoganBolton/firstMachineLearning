i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of churchproduced films i left disappointed that this one fell so short failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questionsbr br the film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of joseph smith its not a true biopic because theres no real coherent narrative most of the episodes concern joseph doing good deeds playing baseball running races and laughing with children often in sloooow motion what a great just folks kind of guy that joseph was huh look at him out there beating rugs for his wife emma well howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives no mention whatsoever is made of polygamy a glaring omissionbr br and it is in such omissions where the film falters it supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering why is joseph getting tarred and feathered why is he getting thrown in jail and why does that mob want to kill him the films climax is of course joseph and hyrums trek to carthage jail riding past a veritable united nations of faces looking out from nauvoos doorways but no mention is ever made about why nothing about smith suppressing the nauvoo expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy the audience is left to wonder or to assume its just more baseless persecution of the church no mention of joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the nauvoo militiabr br of course i certainly did not expect this churchproduced film to present the joseph of richard bushmans recent biography rough stone rolling but i was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presentedbr br and worse what substance that was presented was often inaccurate two examples jumped out at me first the translation of the book of mormon the film shows joseph reading right off the golden plates in their tworing binder which plates in reality were hidden far from the site its well known that joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat peering at the seer stone in there the second inaccuracy occurs at carthage jail where the mob storms the cell the history of the church reports that joseph had a sixshooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the masonic signal of distress as reported in times  seasonsbr br maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the hearttugging mood the filmmakers had created but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show joseph as he really was handy with a gun and able to defend himself in fact the impression the film gives is that joseph was a nice guy but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood he was far from that joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believedbr br see the film but know going in thats its cotton candy then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of bushmans biography of smith rough stone rolling br br ps churchproduced films have no credits but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces rick macy is excellent as joseph smith sr and bruce newbold beloved as thomas in finding faith in christ here plays the cranky methodist minister who failed to show christian love to a young seeker after truth
