i dont know why im taking the time to review this wasteoftime movie if you stick with it long enough in hopes of a satisfying conclusion  good bad or surprising  dont it finally fizzles out after stiff formulaic predictable dialogue and acting indoor scenes are so harshly lit you think if the camera were zoomed out one millimeter further youd see the klieg lights costumes hairdos and sets are starched pressed and immaculate are we supposed to imagine common people really lived like that in early 20thcentury arizona other reviews comparisons to sam peckinpah are an insult to peckinpah at least that director wove his violence into the context of chaos and mayhem hard mens gore is gratuitous exploding squibs from wooden impersonations of bad guys with manicured fingernails huh i can believe heston thought he might have been making something of worth with this film he does get to clutch his gun in his cold fingers but coburn ill never guess why he signed up for this travesty want to see a movie about the end of the west as we knew it the end of westerns as we knew them watch the shootist or unforgiven again the last hard men is a mockery of an obituary to the western
