as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film i found this to be a very disappointing moviebr br yes it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the highly morally dubious premise however it fails abysmally in the important areasbr br there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclairs generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries  possibly in free computers  or possibly not vague longwinded and inconclusive the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical the film feels halffinishedbr br suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher maria doyle kennedy can be drawn to gordon sinclairs unimpressive character especially when he fends off her advances laughable it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous valuebr br not many films leave me feeling cheated but i felt my time was stolen
