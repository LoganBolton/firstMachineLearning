terry west had a good idea w this movie he just didnt flesh it thru there are endless shots of the creepy looking schools exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the films running time also at this school there are only 2 students misty mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning if the script centered on her interesting character wed have a movie to watch she is so gorgeous good news for dvd buyers terry wests earlier and better film blood for the muse is a special feature one thing id like to say is that this movie feels like someone whos not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way then again just watch this for ruby larocca
