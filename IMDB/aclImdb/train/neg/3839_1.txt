some films are so bad that theyre good this is clearly not one of them based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as pinocchios chances of becoming a real boy the acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go homebr br nor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty lowbudget anyway like most of her other films she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and shes talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character it pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruinedbr br probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end but even that wasnt satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad filmbr br watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast
