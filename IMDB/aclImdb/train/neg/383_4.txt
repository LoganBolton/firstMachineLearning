the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest but throughout watching this film we were saying aloud these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations the lighting is good makeup and hair are goodwhy is the sound so bad throughout the film the sound was echoy garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligiblebr br there is some good acting in this film and i think jim thalman is really a good actor this story with some of the same actors would have been worth doing as a highbudget filmbr br i just cant reiterate enough  if you have a limited budget dedicate more to good sound sound is as much a part of a film as the image and its worth doing right couldve earned a 6
