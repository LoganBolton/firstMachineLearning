id heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as wed both heard that this was a terrifying film really scary how disappointed was i very apart from that one scene we all know which bit nothing happened i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes like appear at the window or walk across the hall or somethingbr br nearly all the reviews here say what a scary gripping atmospheric movie this is i just didnt see it im afraid maybe theres a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in britainbr br a big let down after all the hyped reviews
