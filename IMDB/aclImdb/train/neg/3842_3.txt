our teacher showed us this movie in first grade i havent seen it since i just watched the trailer though does this look like a first grade movie to you i dont think so i was so horrified by this movie i could barely watch it it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup i was freaked out by this film now today being 20 i probably would not feel that way i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldnt see this movie even though its pg be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids i dont even remember what it was about once was enough
