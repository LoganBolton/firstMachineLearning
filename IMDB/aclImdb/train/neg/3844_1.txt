first of all i would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie that the actor who played the transvestite is one of my friends his name is robert dugdale hes a terrific actor although it doesnt say much about his filmography hes been in several plays and musicals he is currently residing in terrace bc that is where i am from he comes over to our house almost every saturday laughs okay now about the movie i wouldnt recomend this to anyone who hasnt seen it for it is not a movie worth watching the main reason i found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place it keeps bouncing back between time so kinda hard to follow at some points and second its really boring laughs although the acting is great the movie just doesnt compare
