although bette davis did a wonderful job as mildred i felt that the film wasnt the best i had seen at the end of the movie i was left feeling like there was something missing in itbr br bette davis did a perfect job though and she made me hate her and pity her all the while leslie howard did very good as the lovelorn philip carey and i so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame its such a sad thing when one finds himherself in love with a bad seed and especially if its someone like philp carey who is a sensitive person though patheticbr br in the end the acting was what came through and not the plot the ending scene was particularly good but i am not one to give it away although others may find this movie good i was one who found it soso i should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person
