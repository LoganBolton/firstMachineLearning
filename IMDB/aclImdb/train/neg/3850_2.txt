i saw this film at sxsw with the director in attendance quite a few people walked out and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end of the 60 or 70 films ive seen at this festival frownland is among the worstbr br at 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long you get to watch the main characters failed and drawn out attempts to communicate in extended real time the same grimaces hand over mouth motions kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again  we get the pointbr br one site actually compares this work to early mike leigh what drugs would you have to be on to make that statement given that frownland is a captain beefheart song maybe youd have to be able to enjoy trout mask replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film unbelievably this won a jury award at the festival you can bet it did not win an audience award
