i never thought i see a movie worse than lisa picard is famous but this came pretty close as repeated often throughout the comments it was predictable five minutes into the movie you know it will be a stranded at the alter outcome this movie painfully referencesrips off everything from something about mary to revenge of the pink panther writer greg glienna meet the parents needs some new materialbr br the only twist is the deranged boyfriendpolice officer pursued by internal affairs but even that opportunity is wasted lots of setting shots of the seattle space needle necessary to disguise the obvious canadian shooting locale some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer geez at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a while selma blair is inert and the short haircut a crime 3m to jason lee for what guess it beats skateboardingbr br so heres who should see this movie bee gees fans who want to hear two actors sing islands in the stream badly people who cant get enough of julia stiles 110
