this was one of the most boring movies ive ever seen i dont really know why just your runofthemill stories about guy who is about to get married and starts to fancy someone else instead story has been told a thousand times nothing new or innovative about it at allbr br i dont really know what was wrong with this film most of the time when these kinds of actorsactresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before its really entertaining there are usually little clever thing in them that arent really in any other for some reason this one just doesnt hold your attention you can pick out some funny parts or clever ideas in it but for some reason theyre just not funny nor clever in any way i wish i new how to explain it but i dont just dont waste your time on this one
