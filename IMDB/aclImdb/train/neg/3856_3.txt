a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of theres something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cuttingroom rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a 5day rental because i couldnt sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a timebr br the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for pauls missteps the checker at the savemart was great but the scriptwriting is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sightgag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really needbr br dont get me wrong slapstick humor is great when its smartly done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldnt help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent theres something about mary one more time
