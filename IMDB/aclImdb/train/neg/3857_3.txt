i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre however it was lame and i didnt find myself laughing very much watch it on hbo maybe or if youve got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time but i dont recommend paying to see itbr br the plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better jason lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat just dont go see this one the directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isnt that important i guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny see something else dont waste your time here
