this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell theyre trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you cant the writing is so obvious and facile its sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so labored its hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for thisbr br that said its so awful that were having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this trainwreck goes but thats only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this wed be disgusted br br so it gets 2 stars for being at least amusinglyfascinatingly bad and the incidental music as opposed to the tryingtoohard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scoobydoo but not as good
