i thought this movie had absolutely no moral i mean how would you feel if your fianc√© left you on your wedding day for your cousin i would be heartbroken its classified as a comedy but i didnt find it funny at all i thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them i normally love julie stiles movies but this is an exception jason lee stars in another disgraceful show which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movies like this i understand that people will defend this movie and its morals because it is just a movie but i still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldnt be allowed on screen im not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie you are a bad person as everyone is entitled to their own opinion and parts of this movie were enjoyable im just saying that in real life people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful
