this is the 2nd time ive seen this movie in about 12 years these remarks come from someone who finds kane and ambersons to be amazing worthy films but the remainder of welles career is unfortunately squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering and when he makes a potboiler like shanghai the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on is just kind of sad i couldnt tell you what he was exploring here its all as mannered as welles godawful irish brogue which takes a lot of effort but adds absolutely zero to the film several welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque mr arkadin pick a version any version is a similarly belabored project the material is inconsequential it just cant bear the weight of all this noodling for a director trafficking in realitybased drama as here he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality or to a coherent story the murderforhire scheme is ridiculous br br kudos to welles though for having hayworth cut her hair and getting that performance out of her the camera loves her shes the classiest most upscale sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film but her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision made so the movie will have some genre it fits into the movie cant be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 secondsbr br when all is said and done in lfs the convolutions are all for what to convince you youve seen something thoughtful to give welles more to do to make you roll your eyes welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story or to telling a story directly one wonders what shanghai has to say to anyone who isnt a crippled billionaire arranging a quadruplecross murderforhire scheme or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or substance br br overwrought preposterous unengaging
