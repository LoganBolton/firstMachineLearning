alicia silverstone preclueless plays a modernday crimeobsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl pat verducci wrote and directed this bflick which isnt especially wellmade but is however surprisingly seriousminded in regards to its leading character silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here despite the pictures kitschy undermining the supporting cast including kevin dillon and michael bowen isnt bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard not a cheesy campfest but nothing exceptionally memorable either 12 from
