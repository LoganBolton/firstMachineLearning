one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film abr br script existed that made any sense was the rough cut 3 hoursbr br long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives br br why would anyone finance this mess i will say that tombr br wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canbr br with the dialogue and dramatic  situations he is given butbr br characters come and go for no apparent reason continuity isbr br nonexistent and the acting cinematography and direction are tobr br put it politely amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunatebr br choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyonebr br actually attempt to actually watch this film
