no just kidding it was godawfulbr br i was watching my local scifi station last night which plays movies every night within a monthly theme this month its space turkeys or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs movies so bad they should never have been made this was a good selectionbr br everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions the gore makeup which showed potential and the editing which slightly out did the rest of the movie in terms of being horrible the acting is horrible all around the dialog is horrible the script the direction its not a good moviebr br it consists of two forms of special effects gore and stock footage of space ill focus on the gore watching this movie i thought to myself what was the motivation behind the making of this movie people like making stuff sure but i was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the makeup effects guys demo reel he rick baker actually went on to a pretty nice career hes worked on star wars 1977 king kong 1976 men in black 1996 and even the incredible shrinking woman 1981 plus a number of other notable flicks other than that i cant say ive ever actually seen a real live melting man  incredible or otherwise  but id have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of onebr br now when i think of bad editing i usually think of maybe a scene where someones talking on the phone and then in the middle of the scene the phone jumps down to his shoulder or something to that effect this movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms specifically overlong and utterly useless scenes just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have from a little bit of dead air to that crazylong screaming scene with cleaver girl and that severed head in the river the head gets thrown into a river in slow motion the movie carries on for a couple minutes and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall while im sure they were all very proud of their severed head what the hellbr br lastly ill mention the running fat ladyslow motion scene right near the beginning the jerky slow motion tells me that they didnt shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it wasnt working like that and then slowed it down oy vey in any event if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed glass door  all in slow motion mind you  remember the incredible melting man for this is where it all startedbr br movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends this ones a little slow most of the time but thats just all the more time to come up with your own oneliners its not the worst of the worst but its pretty freaking bad
