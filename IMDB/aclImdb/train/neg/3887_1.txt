i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mst3k and oh boy even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkeybr br the highlights what little there were came from the special effects which were ok the acting for the most part was also ok though nothing special it was of a higher quality than other bmovies i have seen in the pastbr br the rest of this movie is dismally bad the camera work often looks like theyve just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along the story if it can be called that is so full of holes its almost funny it never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place or needs human flesh in order to survive the script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid the climax to movie if there is one is absolutely laughablebr br if you cant find the mst3k version avoid this at all costs
