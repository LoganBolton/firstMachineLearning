i have always wanted to see this because i love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this i was sure the incredible melting man would be a lot of funbr br it really wasnt i mean the acting was entertainingly bad the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor so i should have loved it unfortunately its really draggy between these highlights i decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return thats how boring this film isbr br nevertheless if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse and the stellar acting of the guy who plays dr ted to be fair to the poor man he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face  like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the i m manbr br ill find him with a geiger counter is he radioactive just a little bit br br yes the plot has dr ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a minidyson hes a brave man unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree oh god  its his ear says dr ted to the audience im so glad he cleared that up br br i realise im making this movie sound rather fun it would be if it were only 10 minutes long but unfortunately it goes on and on and the incredible melting dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion i think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it just dont have poptarts during the movie because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end
