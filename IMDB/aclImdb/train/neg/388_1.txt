i cant stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure its his company but youre fired or youre hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldnt want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valvebr br id love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see hes even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i dont have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it id give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesnt deserve that
