i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runsin his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after hed been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiationi think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is thatbr br the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facilitywhich has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space br br thus begins the part of the movie thats pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates lookalike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couplepunishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then theres a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around youd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but nowere treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think wasdirectors girlfriend anyonebr br the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and thennothing thats it thats the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel
