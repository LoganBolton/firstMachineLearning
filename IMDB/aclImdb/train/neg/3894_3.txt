the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man but with violence and some nudity i know this film is a bit crummy but i found it impossible not to kind of like itbr br the acting and script are not the best but the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of 50  the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does its reasonably impressive we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution of note too is the music its insane  a cheesetastic medley of nonsensebr br notable highlights br br  marvel at the slowmotion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoeverbr br  be amazed by a day in the life of a severed headbr br  beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid called stevebr br  be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchenbr br this film is just too 70s for me to hate it its tacky and trashy but i thought it was a lot of fun you could do a lot worse
