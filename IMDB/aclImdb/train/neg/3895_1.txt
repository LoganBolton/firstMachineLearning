once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy that got shot into space supposedly to go to saturn but really only to some stock footage of solar flares and then he gets a nose bleed and before you know it hes laying in a hospital bandaged head to foot and then an overweight nurse with an illfitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy whose supposed to be melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass and then nasa or at least one guy at nasa gets upset about it and calls one other guy in to hunt him down but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy has to go home and have soup first and his oddlyshaped wife forgot the crackers so he cant have crackers and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a geiger counter and that doesnt really work so he really only follows the trail of halfeaten corpses and then theres something about a sheriff and two ugly old people in a lemon grove and a women with a meat cleaver and some kind of industrial plant with triggerhappy security guards and since i cant tell you how the movies ends all i can say is jonathan demme is in it somewhere with some guy with the stupid name of burr debenning and if theres any justice in the world everyone connected with this movie died a hideous violent death and was unable to make more movies and the world lived happily ever after  the end
