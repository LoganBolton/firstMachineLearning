i confessemma in my opinion is the single greatest novel ever written it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art herebr br unfortunately this is at best a palimpsestbr br comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitablethat version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watchbr br there are some good elements herekate berkinsale having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm clearly emmas smarter spiritual twin is a wonderful emma raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill the production is handsome but the interiors are far too darkbr br however there are several major problems the first is mark strongfirst of all he doesnt look right for mr knightley this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson its badly out of tunebr br the second problem is one of length simply put the film is much too shortto get the right kind of feel it would need to be twice as longbr br finally and most significantly there is the quality of the adaptation austen is an adapters dreamall the dialogue is there already it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly andrew davies seems to think otherwise first this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing emma should be is gloomy more significantly davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast what planet or minor work of thomas hardy is this come from it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements uponperfectionbr br watch the paltrow version or watch kate in cold comfort farm
