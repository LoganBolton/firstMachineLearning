im glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read allendes book and get the full story br br pros the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently to the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good jobsbr br cons this is the worst acting job ive ever seen from jeremy ironsi kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth and i hate the terribly english way he says transito winona ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end br br im very curious now whether this movie is typical of bille augusts work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent smillas sense of snow
