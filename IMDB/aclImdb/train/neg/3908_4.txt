theres enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad openmindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately were battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as ive described them br br ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling matchbr br jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we dont get to know them hence we dont get to care for them the result is boredom br br if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfestbr br not recommended
