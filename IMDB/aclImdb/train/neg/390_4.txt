i loved the apprentice for the first two seasonsbr br but now with season 5 or is it 6 things are getting just plain too tiringbr br i used to like the show but its become donald trumps own ego fest granted its his company youll be working for but come on some of the things says youre fired is just insultingbr br after watching the show i would not want to work for him not because he is arrogant pompous or such its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm good entertainment yes but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring its not team work its not personal its just business watch your back jack
