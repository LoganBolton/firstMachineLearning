for the first couple of seasons i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show the combination between reality tv and a 16 week jobinterview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out therebr br the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business  at all in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the businessrelated tasks  now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show that means lying trashtalking backstabbing etc the boardroom can be entertaining to watch but its entertainment at its lowpoint  sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode the tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in reallife br br i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show it also seems like donald trumps massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest i cant see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesnt make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what its worthbr br rip the apprentice please nbc for gods sake get the show off the air as soon as possible its just too embarrassing to watch the apprentice was once a great tvshow but now its just a big fat joke
