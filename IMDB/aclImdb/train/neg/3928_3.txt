universals answer to the exorcist isnt a very good one unfortunately the film offers bland unimaginative direction from michael winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing cratersized plotholes not to mention its unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the storybr br model cristina raines moves into a highrise owned by the catholic church with a creepy blind priest john carradine who holes up in there always at the window she begins to suffer faint spells and nausea whats worse is tenants she meets in the building such as burgess meredithwith a cat and a canaryand a young beverly dangelo as a lesbian ava gardnerlooking great at 55is the realtor who showed raines the place cristinas lover is chris sarandon whose wife committed suicide after finding out they were having an affair jos√© ferrer has a small role as the priest of the brotherhood who informs monsignor arthur kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very highrise not only housing carradine but raines as well sarandon sends a hiredhand up to the highrise one night to check out a certain room above cristinas apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket he winds up dead the very same night cristina kills her dead father in a nightmare screaming mad on the street cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective eli wallach and partner christopher walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to sarandon who is a hotshot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wifes suicide that case is really a motivating factor is wallachs dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on cristina and if sarandon has anything to do with it you also have martin balsam as a professor who understands this type of latin cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as jeff goldblum as a fashion photographer and tom berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very roomnow renovatedthat cristina once stayed in what bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation towards the end of the film wallach and walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating their characters are just left on the backburner how the priests know that now is the time when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that highrise and why cristina suffers through the trauma she does isnt adequately explained how certain ghosts just appear to cristina and disappear when she tries to show gardner the rooms they occupied during a cats birthdaysee for yourselfisnt adequately explained not to mention gardners role in the grand scheme of thingsshe brings people to that highrise but what is really her reasons in the film it seems like this film shouldve been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary
