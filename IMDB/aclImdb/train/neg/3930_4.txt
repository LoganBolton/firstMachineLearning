the second renaissance part 1 lets us show how the machines first revolted against the humans it all starts of with a single case in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they wantbr br although an interesting premise the story gets really silly from then on with violent riots between the robots and mankind somehow it doesnt seem right as another reviewer points it its all a little too cleverbr br the animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix in particular osiris work for the best as for second renaissance part 1 id say its too violent and too silly 410
