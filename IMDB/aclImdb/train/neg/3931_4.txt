prison is set in wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to reopen an old state penitentiary that has been closed for 20 years warden eaton sharpe lane smith is put in charge 200 odd prisoners are shipped in  they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including burke viggo mortensen who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out  all the electrics gas  fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing  noone is safebr br directed by renny harlin i thought prison was a poor late 80s horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story the script was by empire pictures regular c courtney joyner who was responsible for writing such classics as class of 1999 1990 puppet master iii toulons revenge 1991  puppet master vs demonic toys 2004 amongst other low budget horror crap that even i havent heard of  seems to take itself very seriously the biggest problems i have with prison are that its far too slow its over 30 minutes into the film before the evil force is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as i was concerned then theres the fact theres no discernible storyline here at all for a start it never tries to explain why theres an evil force bricked up in the old execution chamber it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when its supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesnt kill warden sharpe straight away no explanation is given to where burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted  has come back theres no real explanation as to how the warden is connected to everything thats going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although its never revealed what it is or why to be honest i couldnt really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesnt have a rigid story which it follows all the way through the characters are dull  forgettable the murders are few  far between the pacing is way off the whole film is a mess  even ghosts cant shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero a less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes there really are better things you could be doingbr br director harlins full american flick debut he does a good job  theres a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab dull dark prison cells  corridors i started to get bored i just think the look of the film is far too repetitive bland  frankly lifeless i didnt think it was scary  the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body  face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open other than that theres a burnt corpse  a mangled body which falls from the ceiling  very little else there is a scene when the warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them  then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard i was watching this scene  thought that youd never get away with doing something like that over here prisoners have rights  if the warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians  every prisoner would sue the warden the prison service  the government for everything they had  theyd winbr br with a supposed budget of about 4000000 prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesnt really look like it on screen sure theres a decent cast  the few special effects that are included are good but overall its set in the same location with limited ambition prison was actually shot in a real wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business the acting is alright prison proves that sometimes hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of mortensen he has two with this  the awful the return of the texas chainsaw massacre 1994 both of which im sure hed like to forget aboutbr br prison is a dull lifeless colourless  humourless waste of 100 minutes despite one good gore scene i didnt like it at all as i actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events  incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense
