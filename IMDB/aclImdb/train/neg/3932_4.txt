this solid little horror film is actually one of renny harlins best the story is pretty routine stuff but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive in fact the ghost story is almost an afterthought the real horror comes from the prison setting itself and renny h spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling leaking ratinfested old hellhole with a sadistic warden too viggo mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role supported by some very authenticlooking prisoners there are no pretty boys in this cast horror fans should check this one out
