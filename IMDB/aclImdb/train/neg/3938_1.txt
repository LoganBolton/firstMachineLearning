not even timothy hutton or david duchovny could save this dead fish of a film for starters the script was definitely written to be made into a bfilm but somehow duchovny looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television and hutton looking for the two of a onetwo punch he had hoped would define his career after ordinary people became attached to the picture cheesy lines big bad wipes from scene to scene come onwho uses wipes after 12th grade telecommunications class and plain old bad acting sink this film even duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film only timothy hutton rises above the material at all i must admit feeling duchovnys pain as he read the lines that are the voiceover while i found myself laughing when im sure the director wanted me to feel terrified nothing prepared me for the closing line of duchonveys voiceover if you ever need a doctor be sure to call 911 if only the studio had called 911 this dog of a motion picture would never have been made avoid at all costs br br
