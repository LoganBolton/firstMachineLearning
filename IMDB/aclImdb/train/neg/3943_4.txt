me neither but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time theres nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie and my name is modesty whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level its full of bactors but isnt any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously it sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growingup drama flashback style the beautiful alexandra staden smothered beyond recognition under makeup more resembles a cast member from top model than modesty blaise im not one of those diehard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious graphic novels to be pitchperfect  in fact ive never even read modesty blaise  all i wanted was a decent movie to watch but this wasnt it the film feels halffinished with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot it also takes its audience for idiots explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago i guess they think we all have alzheimersbr br now i love a good bmovie  whats better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a calzone  and modesty is directed by none other than scott spiegel who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick from dusk till dawn 2 texas blood money i loved from dusk till dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad bmovie should bring to the table  nudity gore guns you name it modesty is just dull the flashback concerning modestys life isnt interesting the acting isnt bad enough to be laughed at in fact i kinda liked nikolaj coasterwaldaus hey buddy pseudonyms are your friends performance as the baddiebr br so overall its just lame weak uninspired call it what you will dont watch anything because tarantino presents it people this is just a very forgettable halfhearted thriller and it never tries to be more than that allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun seriously even im cringing my name is modesty a modesty waste of time  410
