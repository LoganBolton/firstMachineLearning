my name is modesty is a lowbudget film that tells the story of the origins of modesty blaise its not that the movie is terrible its just not what i was expecting or hoping for while ive been aware of the modesty blaise character for years im not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels so im coming into this movie as something as an outsider that may be part of the reason for my disappointment i was expecting more action and more comedy the film is dialogue driven i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value as it is my name is modesty is a deathly serious film there are very few if any light moments the acting at least from alexandra staden is acceptable but nothing outstanding as others have commented she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role what action scenes there are in my name is modesty are one of the films weakest points i never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killersbr br i really hope quentin tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the modesty blaise character im convinced the concept has a lot of potential and i would very much look forward to it
