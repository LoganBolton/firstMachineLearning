the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as inexplicably footage from another uli lommel  suzanna love film brainwaves it is framed with some more current from the early 90s anyway footage that is boring poorly acted and cheaply shot not only is the film almost completely flashbacks they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film so you see the recycled footage over and over again as if you hadnt seen it already as if the originals werent bad enough ive never seen a movie so padded someone was milking the last dollar out of these films total ripoff and talk about padding why do i have to write 10 lines about this trash if i can convey that its garbage in 2 lines that should be enough
