i wont waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as im concerned it isnt really a movie to start with just a careless mishmash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a boogeyman sequel literally 80 of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor the boogeyman a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didnt even bother to watch because they couldnt even get actress suzanna loves original characters name lacy right and to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are 0 out of 10 and i wish imdbs rating system went that low the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off peoples money ive even seen you have been warned
