when i ordered this from blockbusters website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe id forgotten to take my add meds that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon donned in their late 70sstyle wide collars bellbottoms and feathered hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpsterbr br the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe forcing polyester and pornoquality music on the wouldbe viewer from the opening scene with the poorlydone effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of the vagina monologuesbr br throughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob barkers impacted bowels but it had menacing pencilthin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two with some assistancebr br moving on as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue we found out that theyre caught in a space time warp how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information because the oldest male lead tells his son that in a more or less offthecuff fashion like reminiscing about how you won the big game over a cup of joe or an icecold bottle of refreshing cocacola was pops a scientist nope but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einsteins theoriesbr br the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone other than that it was really really really bad theres not enough reallys to describe it reallybr br i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics i never saw this film on its original release but even back then i think i wouldve come to the same conclusion bury this one quick
