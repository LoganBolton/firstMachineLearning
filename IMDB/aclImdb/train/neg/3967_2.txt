dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awardsbr br the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands first a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing second the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are hauntedbr br as the movie goes on the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect however the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings unfortunately the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than oncebr br just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong  and fast and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found herebr br i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poorbr br the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for characterdriven situations and without adding depth to any of thembr br the direction is uninspired the inspiration from jhorror movies such as ringu the grudge and one missed call is evident unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of jhorror jhorror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning there is no humour or tongueincheek element in these movies everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you cant help but be convinced and captivated by it the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact very much unlike the jump scares used in hollywood moviesbr br the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi the homage to jhorror could have been well intended unfortunately the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed scares on the screen the makeup effects of the ghosts werent too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic i was scratching my head quite a few times during this moviebr br i couldnt give away the ending even if i wanted to i simply couldnt understand it all i could deduce was that it was something of an anticlimaxbr br what remains the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom the movie is a chore to sit through thankfully the pain ends after an hour and a half however most would probably switch off long before the endbr br there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie  the successful avoidance of scare clichés and the absence of the fword in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find this is what the 2 stars are forbr br those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house the changeling or the jhorror subgenrebr br if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultralow budget rrated horror movie about ghosts watch death of a ghost hunter it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in storebr br i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague
