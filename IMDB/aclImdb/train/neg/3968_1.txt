if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenetbradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are faked trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their feedback themselves sometimes they even admit it but thats not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie thats why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped onesbr br the movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me laterbr br brian avenetbradley might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies okay they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure
