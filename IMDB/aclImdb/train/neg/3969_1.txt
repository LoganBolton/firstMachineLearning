im writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie whilst its not the worst ive seen it certainly isnt goodbr br a weak script weak actors and weak directing even if they cant afford big name cast would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance the story was a clich√© and poorly scripted the special effects were minimal the suspense tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallowbr br to be fair dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors episodes but not quite on par with quality movies yet dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who dont want to miss any movie in the genre even if its a poorly made one as for anyone else time should be spent on something more valuable  which should be extremely easy
