acting was weak but in a horror flick i can live with that if the story is good it wasnt the initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most peoples adoration of kids ok fine fast forward to the place in the country where they will recover emotionally i like the revelation of the ghosts ok coolthis will be a supernatural kinda horror story with rotting things partly in our world partly inwhere ever then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birdsis there an evil force trying to attack them directly is there an evil force trying to attack them indirectlymake people do awful things they wouldnt really do oh wait no maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder ok hold onmaybe its really just one little mentally tangled delbertstyle redneck boy who misses his mommy and is on some kind of spree like a ktel norman bates knock off oh yeahextra points off the only black character seems to be the grandson of an our gang pullman porter the actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue but the fact is his purpose is yall done betta get outa heah boss at least they wrote him smart enough to gtf outta there the bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy as was the chick in the shower those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie the problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways like a bite of steak a bite of chocolate and a bite of a gummi bear each is great on its own but mixed up bleah such potential wasted
