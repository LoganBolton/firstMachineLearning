okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielbergs close encounters of the third kind or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps its an intellectual  philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended good old john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders and writer david schmoeller of tourist trap must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres the story doesnt make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as its got papiermâché dinosaurs miniature spacecrafts headacheinducing light  laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas the voiceover introduction is practically inaudible but no worries as its all gibberish did you know that the definition of time isnt what we all think it is time doesnt necessarily pass by chronologically it is one giant paradox words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tapdancing midget aliens and wellmannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say wellmannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solarpowered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the granddaughter even more granny is a walking  talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is  incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommys husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about excellent special effects was being sarcastic but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing br br grandpa you know what this is dont you this is a timespace warpbr br stevie im not quite sure if i know what that means dadbr br grandpa well i guess nobody really does br br make up your mind gramps do you know what it is or dont you and stop talking about the vortex like youre some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and notworthbotheringfor fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly
