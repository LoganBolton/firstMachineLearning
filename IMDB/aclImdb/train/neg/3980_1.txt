no im not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio im serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters im sure that when they were really young and made some ok movies some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years or something so that now that theyre what 17 they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studios money let me advise you stay away from marykate and ashley its for your own good
