this movie really has no beginning or end and its really very unbelievable maryk and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company but for some reason theyre put up in a 5star hotel conveniently located across the street from the coliseum and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally modellooking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesnt end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try
