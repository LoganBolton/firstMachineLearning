irene dunne finished her illustrious career with this soso movie she should have gone out with a bang being the classy actress she was not in this unmemorable almost unknown film br br this lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half maybe irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit even her highpitched voice got a bit annoying in here rumor has it she was not happy with this film one can see whybr br the story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom speaking of that i thought david nelson from the ozzie  harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna he looked and sounded just like nelsonbr br overall soso at best and a subpar ending for a great actress
