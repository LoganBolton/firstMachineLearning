in shortbr br spike lee clearly has a lot on his mind hes thinking about racism colorism media and hegemony consumerism and capitalism religion sexism heterosexism politics of the drug war etc etcbr br that level of consciousness on is own is great i think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies however just because lee is making contentious films does not make him a good filmmakerbr br what comes across in jungle fever is a superficial understanding of these sociopolitical forces this is largely the result of two main failuresbr br firstly lee is simply trying too hard he seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every politicalsocial statement he can think of into the 90mins and as such the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present and so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs the end result is very staged and unrealisticbr br secondly by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the socialpolitical issues presented what comes across is a puddle of regurgitated nonsense you feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pagesbr br these are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker he is unable to distance himself from the work and allow it to speak for itselfbr br it functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argumentbr br although i still do appreciate lee bringing up these important issues i must saybr br two thumbs down
