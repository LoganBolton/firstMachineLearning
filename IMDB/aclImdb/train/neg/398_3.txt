cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode its just an old 60s tv show  this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesbr br this use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showbr br except a few notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever  assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting averagebr br this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplebr br just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper  every expense spared or what
