this movie was exactly what i expected not great but also not that bad either in my opinion pg13 movies arent scary enough so thats why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room but nothing we all havent already seen i guess i didnt like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening it got old and repetitive i also didnt understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about what i did like was the special effects other than that there wasnt much enjoyment from it maybe its just me but i thought this was below average
