i am a huge huge fan of john cusack samuel l jackson and tony shalhoub im slightly less fond of stephen king but i like some of his workbr br this said i should have loved 1408br br possible spoilers after this point br br i walked in eager i walked out disappointedbr br this is not the fault of the actors shalhoub and jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts cusack in the guy in a locked room scenariobr br this wasnt a bad movie but i cant call it a good one either it was a muddied mess that had moments of ouch thats just wrong combined with moments of ouch thats just painful and moments of oh now thats just unfortunate with very little continuityconnectivity between them eislins father shows up once and theres no seeming connection to the rest of mikes personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room br br a previous commenter described the olinenslin argument as worth watching and i very much agree but other than that aside from some clever musical cues the room almost playfully torments enslin a little bit and gives him one chance to get out before upping the anteat which point it gives him the onehour countdown clock and the titular line from the carpenters weve only just begun its mostly stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it type horror that was fun when i was fourteen and surrounded by friends my age clutching each other in the summer while jason stalked camp crystal lakebr br the rest of the movie was lets make him relive some of his most painful experiences mindgaming with lets animate the paintings in creepy ways cliché cheesinessbr br end spoilers br br i expected better from this movie with stephen kings name attached to it as well as the actors i mentioned abovebr br we never find out the origin of the evil we never get to see the evil defeated though we can presume maybe it was defeatedbr br and the ending was just a jarring what momentbr br wait for it to come on cable i wouldnt have minded paying for it as a matinée but im feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it
