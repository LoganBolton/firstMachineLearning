1408 is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics the kind that might make datemovie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and directionbr br john cusak plays a writer whos made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal when he learns of the history of room 1408 at the overlook hotelno wait i mean dolphin hotel in new york cityhe decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book but samuel l jackson playing the hotel owner strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotels opening many years ago the story is simple and we as possible skeptics must sit through jacksons lengthy foreshadowing ramble br br in other words be afraid be very afraidbr br of course it would be easy to convince audiences that theyve just paid to see an edgeoftheseat thriller if it didnt take so long to build up to this point and also if what followed was a lot more than cheap boos that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually you might soon expect them the temperature in the room changes automatically the walls drip with blood the fearless writer cant open the door etc and after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending with suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative timewasters even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettablebr br despite grand performances as always by cusak who essentially is the entire film most everyone else of note is wasted ie samuel l jackson in insignificant minor roles the true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating ballotstuffing ghosts
