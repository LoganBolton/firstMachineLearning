i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smiths first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasnt but i gave it a gobr br what a dead end film being truetolife hardly serves you if youre merely going to examine tediousness esp tediousness that were already familar withbr br im sorry but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum wage jobs in the service sector i knew that before i saw the film it didnt really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real handheld camera no music etc whats going on hardly plays out as it would in the real worldbr br would an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after abandoning his job and screwing up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on himbr br a big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because hes stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one hes a dope he doesnt pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero personalty if i had to hire someone he wouldnt make it past the interviewbr br im looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the thisisanimportantfilm stuff american job doesnt work
