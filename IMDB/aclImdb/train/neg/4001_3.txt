having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series without seeing any of them i looked forward to this eagerly surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong how wrong i was br br the polemics backed by frequent repetitive and violent flashbacks were overpowering the production tried to be supermodern but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated robbie coltrane sleepwalked through the two hours coming up with unexplained and unlikely insights and the police were portrayed as onedimensional bumbling idiots as a result the tension never built up and the nexttofinal scene no details for fear of spoilers was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long timebr br no i dont want to see any more of these but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation
