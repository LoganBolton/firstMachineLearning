a major disappointment this was one of the best uk crime drama  detective shows from the 90s which developed the fascinating title character played by scotlands robbie coltrane however this oneoff has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus coltrane isnt really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems uninvolved almost bored the exsoldiers story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltranes family life seems lightweight perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one twohour show they would have written this with much more depth as is skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90s which is far far superior
