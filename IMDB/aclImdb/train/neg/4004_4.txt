as a huge fan or the cracker series i have been waiting 7 years for the next addition this episode im afraid just does not live up to the legendbr br fitz returns to manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in northern irland goes on a killing spreebr br what i did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how fitz is led to the murderer it is all fat to farfetchedbr br there are however some good scenes in flash backs from northern irland which are filmed great
