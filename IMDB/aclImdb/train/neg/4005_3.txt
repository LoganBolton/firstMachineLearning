im a true fan of the original cracker series and own all of them on dvd cracker had a tendency to be overthetop on occasion but robbie coltrane and the other cast members as well as the writers always seemed to carry it off despite themselves i count the original cracker among the great brit tv crime series of that time and theres some stiff competition prime suspect inspector frost inspector morse jeremy bretts sherlock homes and a host of others cracker along with prime suspect was on the top of my listbr br which makes a new terror all the more sadbr br ultimately this was a very pale imitation of crackers former glory i forced myself to sit through the whole thing convinced that it couldnt actually be this bad and that some spark would eventually ignite i was wrong it was bad from beginning to endbr br a few criticisms first just to get any potential bias upfront right off i was offended by the antiamerican antiwar screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show the topper the murder of two americans innocent of any crime and a british junkie is in fitzs words understandable but not justified i thought i waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel so i had a negative reaction to the antiwaramerican tone brought on by my beliefs beyond the politics i had the distinct sense that this cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak scriptbr br second just how much airtime did robbie coltrane get fitz was almost a bit player in this one as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of fitzs role coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders but the writer was apparently thinking of other things and missed the chance and by a wide marginbr br third what an abysmal script there was some sparkle and a couple of bits of actual character development fitzs son ranting that fitz couldnt stay at his house if he missed his plane to australia the detective that liked to beat his poorperformers over the backs of their heads and some of the old sparks between fitz and his missus but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline br br fourth where the hell was panhallagan now that would have been interesting it was manchester after all and 10 years on shed be up in the ranks another wasted opportunity or perhaps the actress wasnt interested br br well theres much more thats bad to say  but ill close with a curiosity at the end of the show as it aired on bbca when the advertisement announced that the directors cut was available on bbc ondemand i thought ahha the directors cut which presumably one has to pay for might have all of the goodies i expected to see tonight but never did like a coherent interesting storyline unfortunately after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of a new terror with the hope of seeing something anything worth watching only to be disappointed i have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second potentially longer and more tedious version besides it angered me to think that bbca sliced and diced and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless every ten minutes or so stream of commercials and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonightbr br to close i quote the first paragraph of varietys review of a new terror it really says it all initial excitement about robbie coltrane reprising his role as the bbcs flawed boozing womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavyhanded political statement writer jimmy mcgovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic jolting at first in its message  namely that americans are a bunch of whiny nambypambies who didnt care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep  mcgoverns chestclearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing fitz back on the case
