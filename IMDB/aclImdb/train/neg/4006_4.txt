for those of you whove never heard of it or seen it on ae cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight chainsmoking foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals its considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england and thats saying something and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993br br now the original stars have reteamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2hour episode ive loved this show ever since id first seen it over a decade ago the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection and i can quote a good deal of fitzs interrogation scenes practically word for word the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute gleebr br ill start with the good one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture throwing the books into the air his drinking and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue  and you knew simply knew who this character was you could feel him clicking in your mind the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writerbr br coltrane of course remained great throughout the show but i always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by mcgovern  mistreated the characterbr br so the good news is this fitz is back as soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughters wedding  youll feel that click once again its him petulant one moment and truly sorry the next always insightful sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process if you love this character as much as i do youll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie and this extends to judith and mark in fact everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectlybr br the problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime fitz is trying to solve in standard cracker fashion we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the suspense lies in seeing fitz figure it out in this case we have a serial killer who is out for american blood and the reason for this unfortunately is not due to any believable psychological trauma  rather it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefsbr br its difficult for me to write this as i truly believe that jimmy mcgovern is one of the greatest writers in the world nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues or movies that take a political stand but in the cracker universe we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings not like caricatures instead the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion theyre knownothing loudmouths who complain about everything treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes i honestly thought id mistakenly switched channels or somethingbr br but it doesnt stop there we get constant reminders of just how badly the war in iraq is going  reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere the killer is so busy ranting about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing but more to the point he is such a mouthpiece for the writers political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being and thus we  as an audience  dont buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serialkilling soulbr br i cant say that this ruined the show for me  its was still good tv better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to once again coltrane but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like to be a somebody  an episode that was just as issuey but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depthbr br two other small points panhandle not being around is a disappointment but whats worse are her replacements the entire police department  which for so long filled with such great characters  is now full of vanilla completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain couplings richard coyle of personality is beyond me but it is indeed missing herebr br also there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire population of manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria french windows how does the computer know if i have french windows  he not only succeeds in doing this but he succeeds in less than an hour i dont think sobr br so all in all i was a little disappointed its recommended viewing but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door still if theres new series to come after this it would all have been for the good im convinced that mcgovern can still write great stuff and maybe now that hes got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people
