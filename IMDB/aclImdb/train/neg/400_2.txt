i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie its so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply cant suspend disbelief the problem starts early when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle overlooking the capitol building in washington dc that kind of life on a government salary hah it only gets worse toward the end when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die in order to cleanse the gene pool the special effects are pretty good  any producers money can buy that  and the lead actors have been great in other films but the screenplay and direction here are moronic many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoevens previous facially stupid movies showgirls starship troopers but this movie should stop the wondering hes just plain bad
