this show had a lot of hype but i didnt know about it until the midseason season 1 someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the shows format im happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the storybr br somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed hes in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie and for some reason sookie gets mad when she later finds out about iteven though shes sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesnt do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didnt care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldnt have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookies grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jasonbr br then once sookie and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots taras mother wants an exorcism then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasnt so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his grandmothers stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal hes only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than herbr br subtlety is not this shows strong suit it doesnt take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my assumption wasnt dead on it wasnt that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldnt possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked ladys face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout as if that wasnt enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then its time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the penultimate episode its revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they shove renee being the killer in your face sookie remarks that its odd that renees thoughts dont have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to renee being a fraud but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fianc√©e finds a tape in one of renees boxes about how to fake a cajun accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie who still manages to kill renee they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some antivampire churchwhich makes me care about him even lessbr br its almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better im interested in seeing what happens in season 2 but if i watch it ill most likely wait for the season completion
