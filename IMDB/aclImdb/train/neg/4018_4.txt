this film is too skeletal its a fairly lowbudget film i hope which excuses it somewhat but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much phillips is quite believable in his role as a tornapart son of a welloff family whos searching for himself though his family iserwell a little too white but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are way too many subplots which is an obvious sign of plotdeficiency they needed filler i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone who isnt either a hardcore phillips fan or who has absolutely nothing to do 410
