dakota 1988 was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle this film is similar to the later released film harley there are a few differences but theyre both the same i dont know which one came first i guess itll remain one of the mysteries of life but they both are troubled kids who are trying to turn there lives around instead of bikes this one involves horses theyre basically the same movie and theyre both cheesy as hell if youre a serious ldp fan then i recommend that you watch them both you get some extreme mugging and posturing from ldp if youre game then go for itbr br not recommended except for ldp fans
