this is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it i couldve understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this im a b movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks i love are put aside by regular viewers but take my word on this one vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worstits hard to imagine vampires with no fangs the music score is totally out of placethe sound effects are just not effective and finally mrsavage doesnt seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad cause he had a not to bad career over all let me know if im to hard on this one cause when i dont like a movie i tend to forget about its good side
