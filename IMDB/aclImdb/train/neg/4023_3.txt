i was watching this with one of my friends who is a vampire freak and i was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists this film should be shown to prisoners of war yes its that bad even john mccain wouldnt be able to sit through this so why the 310 rating because it had a vampire midget come on whats more entertaining than a vampire midget theres one scene in this film where john savage gets laid by saying i want to feel human again and the chick being the brainless stripper slut she is lets him feel human i wish i could feel human with jessica alba or megan fox this is a movie for stoners there is bright flashy objects and random movements all in all dont waste your money on this garbage i got it for free when i was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said free so in a way i didnt get ripped off but still
