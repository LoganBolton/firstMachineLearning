this had all the makings of a very good film  good actors robert loggia ellen parker a good plot mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet and lots of stock footage if the air force had film of jets firing rockets it was used unfortunately it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timelinebr br the movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit at under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4000 miles it emits an exhaust of a million degrees burning up everything on the ground including glaciers distant early warning dew line bases and eskimosbr br every attempt at destroying the missile failsbr br the first flaws in this film appear early on while we dont expect much from lowbudget films some things cant be forgotten  like a little research for instance both the soviets and the us fire antiballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy however the first successful abm tests werent done until march of 1961 by the russiansbr br there is too much melodrama dr loring loggia and his assistant joan woods ellen parker play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin parkers character cries and boohoos at loggias sacrifice like she was at a screen test loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman a scientist phillip pine hams it up so much he makes william shatner look like a thespian a bus driver continually spits out endoftheworld crap in scene after scene the only good actor is the film narrator played by veteran character actor lawrence dobkins naked citybr br all of this could be overlooked if it wasnt for the timeline after the missiles info is sent to dc the pentagon brings in a group of scientists a general larry kerr announces that the missile will hit new york city in 63 minutes after this there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the russians and if a response is necessarybr br the film shows the military being fully scrambled civil defense people leave work and go to their stations eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids and we get to see the whitest new york city ive ever seen though watching 50s scifi films made it seems like this was the standard the press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes then incredibly a man at the pentagon announces that the missile will hit ottawa canada in 51 minutes all of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes then to add fuel to the fire loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile he slowly produces a caseload of plutonium loads it in a jeep and takes it from dc to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile along the way he is knocked off the road by a wild driver breaks down and then is carjacked he finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile again all this in the same 63minute time framebr br the movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if ottawa might be saved only to show men women and children get roasted the missile is then said to have five minutes to reach new york loggia is still driving to the base 4 more miles to go he gets to the base and arms the missile a twominute countdown is then announced all within five minutes the boroughs of new york should have been at least scorchedbr br by the way the missile is destroyed if you havent guessed the abm warhead destroys it with a massive plutoniumbased nuclear blast five seconds later the blast dissipates and all is clear yeah they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 hiroshimas on the outskirts of new york city and nothing happensbr br the film had all the elements necessary to be a good b film but wasted them loggia played his character so lamely you didnt care that he sacrificed himself in the end you didnt care about the other characters not even the smarmy scientist played by pine the tension that should have moved the film along just wasnt physically possible in the timeline allowed it still wouldnt be today not even with jack bauerbr br this film is very difficult to find as far as i know it hasnt been reissued on any medium and for good reason i dont know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice but theres a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists military men and businessmen into deep shelters saying theyre too valuable to lose there isnt a single woman or minority in the bunch hari rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano it was worse than 27 days where an alien gives five earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesnt include any blacks or hispanicsbr br i saw this on a special scifi night on turner classic movies and i dont expect it to show up again if you do find a copy of this somewhere you might want to put it up on amazoncom
