the story idea behind the lost missile isnt bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the subpar levelbr br the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth in a panic because its about to strike the earth the soviets manage to deflect the object this isnt necessarily good however as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet in other words with each pass it makes a swath of death followsone that could potentially kill us all so its up to the good scientists of the us led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia to formulate and plan to save usand especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path unfortunately they arent able to save ottawa ive never been there so i cant say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old american knowhow they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction br br so as you can see the story idea isnt bad and rather original but so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may likeall others see it at your own risk
