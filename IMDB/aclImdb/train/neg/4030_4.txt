i remember watching lost missile actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home i was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me  i was from time to time the eric cartman of the 1960s  sorry guys and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of milliondegree heat emerged as a plot device  even as a secondgrader i knew that a mere missile just couldnt carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation br br my inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a selfpunishing crimebr br the films production values were very good the acting isnt bad apart from the shatnerism of the actor who played governors aide that someone else here mentionedbr br but the idea of a missile easybaking the surface of the earth by means of the heat of its exhaust nobr br howd the people at mystery science theater 3000 miss the lost missile anyway br br its a great classic of unintentional comedy  watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend
