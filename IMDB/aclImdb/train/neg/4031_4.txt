really its a dreadful cheat of a film its 70minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors please dont askbr br the plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth its a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built hbomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much pass√© by thenbr br what saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage ive never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see theres a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f89 scorpion and an f86 first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f86 sabre jets or canadian built cf13s and even a pair of cf100 clunksbr br then for some reason there are b52s b47s and even b36s are seen taking off more paddingbr br these canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour i dont think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era gloster meteor the rest f80s the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f84f with a flight of early straight wing f84s attacking in formationbr br theres a strange tandem cockpit version of the f80 that doesnt seem to be the t33 training type but some sort of interim allweather interceptor variant with radar in the nose these are scrambled in a snowstormbr br an angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters it launches f8u crusaders f11f tigers a5 vigilantes and a3 skywarriors the air force scrambles f86s and f84s and more f89s then youve ever seen in your life as well as f100 super sabres and f102 delta daggersbr br the f100s press their attack with sooooo much padding the f89s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo the f86s fire an f102 lets loose a falcon even some f80s f94s with midwing rocket pods let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f84 prototype with a straight wing early model f85 above it in a turn obviously a manufacturers republic aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f84 thunderjet how it strayed into here is anybodies guessbr br there is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york citys times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s br br i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mindboggling and there is a nice tr 3 to be seen also canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the backgroundbr br as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture and she most definitely is flipping someone off could it be r as in robert loggia the director who dies before this film was released her career as this was her last creditbr br its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift
