i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv its very typical of late 50s scifi sober depressing and not a little paranoid despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style  which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely lowbudget venture while not uninteresting in itself theapocalypseviarenegademissile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both dr strangelove 1964 and failsafe 1964 and mercifully short the films singleminded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter  particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents
