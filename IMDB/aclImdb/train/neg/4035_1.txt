i hate to be the one to rain on a parade even a small one like this but from the very first scene you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite its a shame really as i quite like martin freeman and danny dyer i was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together but to my dismay they did not even have a scene together i think i need to repeat this  the two lead actors who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and dvd covers did not have one scene together they did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie false advertisementbr br the dialogue was painful every single character in the movie was unrealistic and unhuman like the scenarios were far fetched the plot was crap the jokes were thin freeman tried too hard to be funny and played a poor mans tim from the office nobody was likable and worst of all some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off as i couldnt bear to watch or listen to them any longerbr br this low budget stinker was an epic fail even danny dyer couldnt inject some humour and charm into this but bless he tried what a waste of timebr br how anybody could rate this movie as ten stars is beyond me ten stars seriously come oni wont even give some of the greats ten stars as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect this film was far from perfect almost the opposite meaning that it was almost completely dire throughoutbr br watch it if you like but if youve seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies your review will probably similar to minebr br 110
