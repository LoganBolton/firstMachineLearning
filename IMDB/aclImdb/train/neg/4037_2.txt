i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically unwatchablebr br supposedly the performances on the shield are greatbr br in reality the show is so badly put together that you cant even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before theyve had their full impactbr br i dont know what intellectual rationale there is for that but it robs the show of all emotional impactbr br ill give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but thats pretty much all i can give itbr br its a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed
