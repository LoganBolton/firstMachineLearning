to sat how awful the shield is youd have to write pages and pages so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directingbr br when directors go awry should have been the title of this production indeed directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and storytelling that propels the story forwardbr br how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a style how is it propelling the story forward of course theres also the editing by random numbers nonsense apparently its become hip to just cut randomlybr br i guess its too much work to do good editingbr br well that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most overhyped and unwatched shows of all time
