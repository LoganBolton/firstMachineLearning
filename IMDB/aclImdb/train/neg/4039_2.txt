there are two kinds of characters on the shield people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes and everyones only hope more than any other show the shield is about hypocrisy and selfdelusion unfortunately the hypocrites and selfdeluders are the shows heroes and as such have the typical genrefiction heroes improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again making fools out of all of their peersbr br the show boasts excellent camerawork the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb it really is a work of art to see unfortunately the story is a cartoony overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence rape and liesbr br the hero who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications if another cop detects something wrong with something hes doing and someone gets hurt because of his actions he always blames the suspicious cop regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause every timebr br like 24 this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season boring unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody perverted chunks of meat that are the characters corrupt acts and the inevitable coverupsbr br most disappointing though is the writers hubris as they try to change the viewers sympathies back and forth to and away form the characters on whims sometimes they want us to see shane as the enemy sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous sexual dynamo sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragicbr br none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want once theyve shown these characters ruin other peoples lives for their own ends thats it it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth but then it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station right under everyones noses
