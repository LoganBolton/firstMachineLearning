i consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama i can be very stuck up about films toobr br not all art films however are better than king kong i quite possibly would give kong two stars double this films haulbr br my guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play for the less discerning artbuff a film that looks like a play is great artbr br this film however was uselessbr br there was hardly any story so it relied on high drama the only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not so deep and meaningful dialogue then no great acting hardlybr br to be excessively fair some of the scenery was interesting though communist flats city vistas petersburg and the soviet trams still in service
