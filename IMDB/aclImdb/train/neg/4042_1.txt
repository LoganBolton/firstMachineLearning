this film is beautiful to look at but is like watching really bad experimental theater the plot if there was one doesnt make any sense but it is very artistic lots of shots of halfdressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each others eyes lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame mumbling and people wandering wistfully lingering closeups of faces and bodies by the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat youll be ready to throw a bottle of ky at the screenbr br it is supposed to be about a father and sons relationship but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f each other and get it over with if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots your wish has been granted
