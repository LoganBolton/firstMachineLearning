set in south africa a young black guy tries to land a part in a gangsta movie but with no knowledge of street life hes told to find out what that life is really like or he wont get the part he manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted but for the gangs leader the burgeoning disaster of his new friends life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his ownbr br while that may sound relatively interesting its anything but the first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious while the hijacking only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases in those chases only two police cars are used both of which are early 90s nissan sunnys not only would these be rather cheap to pick up and i find it rather hard to believe theyd be using such mundane old cars in south africa in the year 2000 but as far as i can remember theres only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once the car chases are very badly shot with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads and theyre all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as youre supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting this now leads me onto the characters and the acting which are equally bad the aforementioned kid who drives the car looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police everybody else is equally unconvincing so much that they even look bored at times themselvesbr br at the closing scene of the movie our main character sox moraka is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park while having trouble opening it the police arrive and ask him what hes doing and he replies by telling him its their car after a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car after hes in the police return fire and in turn he gets wounded after another pathetic chase sequence they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence what follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects ive ever seen when the car explodes superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that arent even in time its so badly done and so phony looking that its hard to even put it into words and really needs to be seen to be believed if you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier ive seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries the car is a volkswagen golf mk2 gti something that wouldnt be worth a huge amount at all and they seriously couldnt afford to destroy it with a real explosion id love to know how large the budget for this movie was it feels so cheap that im surprised it made it outside of south africa and even more surprised it made it to a dvd releasebr br i know its not a big budget hollywood production i know its meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of south africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market but with the laughable effects poorly executed car chases awful acting and ludicrous characters any sense of reality is completely lostbr br overall i most certainly do not advise you to watch this if you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done low budget messes of amovie ever created then id recommend it for that and only thatbr br it is a wretched poorly made poorly edited poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts ive seen many south african movies including lots of cheap nuimagenuworld action pictures and despite their cheesiness theyre far better than this on all counts
