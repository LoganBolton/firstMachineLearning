warning may contain spoilers which will be more entertaining than this tripe br br heres some good advise to anyone living in the uk whenever channel 5 has an old 80s comedy on late at night read a book instead i am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure due to reading some of the comments on this film on here i am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic all i can say is thank god the cold war never escalated or else we might as well have given the commies our borders i found this film dire in the utmost pretence maybe it is just my british perception of what makes a film funny who knows but in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth grindingly terriblebr br ive never been a fan of bill murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him dont get me wrong i loved ghostbusters which was made only three years after this film but this just sums bill murray up really i can safely say that i havent wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of operation delta force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think for 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd they are both riddled with cheesy clich√©s throughoutbr br heres one thing these guys are supposed to be in the us army yet they are allowed to wallow around their camp willy nilly seducing female military police officers and subsequently shagging them silly in the generals quarters talk about random this film is just terrible for this im afraid now dont get me wrong im no feminist sympathiser but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them letting them go free twice is just insulting to the female race the fact that one tatty haired fat lipped bum winger and his hapless sidekick ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the mps underwear to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrousbr br then there is the training scenes where you get to meet the squad phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great john candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes leading to loud mouthed murray paying tribute to the giant toe wtf drill seargent who honestly couldnt organise a pi up in a brewery let alone his band of recruits all this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass hole all the time etc etcbr br the scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the assault course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle peppering a watch tower with bullets just like that yep told you this film was randomhe miraculously escapes undisciplined as well eventually leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours bugger me miracle thanks to some wise words from murray to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a geriatric general in front of the rest of the squads all of this to the immense pleasure of their two girlfriends on the stand who really shouldve been arresting them everyone laughs it off though this bit is nothing short of amazing though he then chooses them to guard a new multimillion dollar prototype armoured vehicle in italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside claiming this is exactly what this army needs rightobr br then there is the dire finale where murray and ramis decide to steal this topsecret prototype military vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat hyperactive mp girlfriends in germany to which the hapless captain john larroquette then finds out and leads the squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval mission for this vehicle to which they then take a wrong turn enroute and end up in soviet held czechoslovakia where they are captured like we didnt see that coming thus begins a rescue attempt by ramis and murray  birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up with them coming back as national heroes humiliating the russians by calling them pussies etc etc the end thats right no courts martial nothing they only just stole a prototype military vehicle drove it into a warsaw pact country and almost caused an international incident which couldve sparked ww3br br this film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness i know its meant to be a comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it have channel 5 cuts those bits out the only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers and female mud wrestling like i said random not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course this film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year olds sadly we have to watch it instead 1 star out of 10  total tripe my advice do something a little more useful with your time like castrating yourself
