i didnt like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my moviegoing tastes in the 80s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad moviebr br now stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad moviebr br why is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but its just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if youre used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the moviebr br stripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramiss lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the moviebr br lastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murrays selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you dont find that character funny like i didnt youre not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny eitherbr br stripes is very much a movie of its era it hasnt aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early 80s buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
