shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacons character sebastian caine i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of selfrespect to account for
