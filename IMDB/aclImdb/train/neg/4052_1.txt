i just saw ifÂ… i can remember the advertisements for the movie from 1968 so i was interested in finally seeing it it may be the perspective of an american who never went to a british public school and misses some of the social references but i thought the movie was awful for one thing as others have pointed out it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooedatthetime revolt to break out for another whether the last scene is real or imagined what occurs isnt a revolt but a shooting rampage theres quite a differencebr br i know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events but one cannot avoid doing it here one person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at columbine high school and virginia tech but if theres a scintilla of difference between klebold harris and cho on the one hand and travis malcom mcdowell on the other i simply cant see it all four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a fed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility forbr br which brings me to why the hell are travis and his chums even in a school they so despise they are adults or close to it theyre not in a military prison like the inmates in the hill a much better british film from about the same time no one is forcing them to go to college and take beatings from the the whips except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wakeup about the nature of their sons i had the opportunity in college to join a frat except i couldnt stand to be given silly cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective brothers i took the consequences of not having the in with the establishment that frats provide and i cant say i regretted itbr br if travis fancies himself the second coming of lenin whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room hes free to go out and organize a fitters union or work for michael foot in the next election if he wants to be jack kerouac then get on the road and start writing what possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his roombr br sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in last tango in paris where brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes in the real world the person said a listener would say why didnt you scrape it off change your shoes dont allow fictional characters to lay a selfpity trip on you because you dont dare point out an commonsense alternative course of action for them so it is here
