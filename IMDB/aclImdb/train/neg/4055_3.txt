ive read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict british school in the 1960s to understand this maybe thats true if so then this movie is outdatedbr br spoiler alert the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids whore antigovernment and anticorporation without having any better solution that doesnt torch society to a mad max type cinderbr br yeah the main characters could leave but they dont the reasons they go about this dont make sense there isnt enough character development to explain why what shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at it is mentioned that war is the final creative expression quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have and it makes no sensebr br the characters who go on a murder spree arent fighting the institution theyre just killing people i thought they mightve used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end that wouldve made greater symbolic sense but they didntbr br tldr  this movie is an adolescents daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them though in reality they need it has no moral symbolic truth or meaning to it this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in power that annoy youbr br if you think a murder rampage school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you dont like then i guess youll love this movie if youre like me and youre working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly very blindly in this movie rebelling against the man this movie is juvenile and boringbr br you can also tell in parts that funding was lacking and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorderbr br all in all this seems like a very rough draft of what couldve been an okay movie but no effort is put into the dialogue character development or moral so its just poorly donebr br if only i could get my two hours back
