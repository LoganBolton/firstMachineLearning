this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects there are some interesting visualsbr br aside from that its typical ninetiesaughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance true to the titlebr br its not worth picking apart the story thats like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur theres not much there to begin with its nothing original and not very special so dont go in for the story at all just look at the effectsbr br as has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible and at times half invisible man however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics its a sight to behold or not to beholdbr br all in all its a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone
