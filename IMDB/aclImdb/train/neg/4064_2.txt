this movie is extremely boring it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life nothing exciting ever happens the director has really kept it real and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life i had to watch other films by this director for a class the others were not as boring this film was also watched for an assignmentit better be worth the boringness with a good grade overall unless its required dont watch the film but dont discount other films by this director because theyre not as badand dont discount other films about africa theyre usually good especially when done by a western director
