through the similarly minded antics of eric stanze a notparticularly talented director has helmed a notparticularly good movie yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits if for nothing more than to see what happens nextbr br a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame after capturing her even though she came willingly and threatening her into having sex another event she was also willing to do he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past he then decides to kill her huh but is foiled and dies instead the girls mind snaps or something like that and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basementbr br alright the writing sucks its long winded loaded with tencent words and there is way too much of itbr br the acting sucks what a minute what acting br br the filming sucks home video is bad enough but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insultbr br and the budget is a joke get itbudget that was the punchlinebr br and yet there was a charm to the thing back in the 70s these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them not in this day and age though if you want to watch this kind of violent sexually exploitive trash dont lie some of us do then this is all your gonna get nowadaysbr br some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene torture with fecal material fun with axes anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menubr br its not good and it wont be remembered but not since the heyday of joe damato have people made movies like thisbr br 410
