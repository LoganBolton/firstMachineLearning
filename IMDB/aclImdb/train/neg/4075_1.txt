im a horrorgore movie freak and this flick was so bad i felt embarrassed for not only the actors but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlockbr br from the title youd expect some great carnage somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog instead you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode at least i laugh at the three stooges while watching this crap i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happenedbr br needless to say i kept watching sternbr br watching this film i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys 2 dv cameras 50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc this film is my inspiration to get into nobudget film making watch this movie if you dare but be warnedthere is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action this makes kazaam look like a meryl streep filmbr br im sure germany didnt ban it due to sex or violence other countries need to take heed
