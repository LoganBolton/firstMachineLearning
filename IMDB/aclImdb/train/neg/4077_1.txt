what do you get when you have bad acting bad directing scenes that are excruciatingly long terrible lighting painful editing and awful effects you get jessica a ghost story seems its shot on betacam which is fine but the lighting has to compliment this medium in this case it does not there are a few cus where the persons face is entirely in shadow one scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists its a joke if you ask me some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half but i guess then they wouldnt have a film at feature length the main character is incredibly flat hes the lead male so he should have some hero elements to his character but he does not he whines and is scared the entire film i could go on but i dont want to waste my time although the lighting was terrible i must say that they did have nice camera movement too bad the lighting didnt compliment it the cover of the dvd is nice and thats where it ends just terrible
