this film was just painful to watch not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations yeah i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours now you all may think im just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or artistic filmmaking well youd be wrong on both counts i love the works of shakespeare especially the tragedies of romeo and juliet julius caesar macbeth and hamlet and ive watched plenty of arthouse films such as the surreal and wellmade eraserhead and fellinis 8 12 but this was just over two hours of lostintranslation shakespeare way too much nudity i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes but not in every other shot of a movie it was pointless and served nothing for the story and basically just overzealous filmmaking i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be very artistic and was an adaptation of shakespeares the tempest but this was just an extreme letdown i gave this film a three only because of sir john gielguds acting presence which far surpassed all of the nonames in this film and the cinematographyset design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion however a lot of this film wouldve been better off as just a painting with a scroll of text below it a true disappointment maybe if zeffirelli had been given the directors chair this wouldve been much better but this is one audience members opinion many others may enjoy this far more than me that being said if you cant find this at any nearby video stores its currently not on dvd dont try to go too far out of your way to find it its not really worth it
