i saw this movie when it was released and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years br br heres why br br greenaways goal seems to be to take every literary image in the tempest and make it literal if a character were to say my heart takes flight wed be shown an actual human heart with pigeon wings attached flapping across the screen br br this process makes for some lush tableaux but ultimately its a facile exercise and it becomes deadly boringbr br i dont begrudge the pleasure other viewers found in this movie but its worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured
