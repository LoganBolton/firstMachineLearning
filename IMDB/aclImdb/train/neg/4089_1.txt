warning this review contains a spoilerbr br  wow almost impressively bad note i said almost this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story the protagonists you cannot call them heroes shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob same for similar reasons theres also tons of homoeroticism which was a turnoff for me spoiler it seems as if the villainess who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim gets killed early on but miraculously recovers adding another 70 minutes of audiencetorture i cant shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination if youre in a mst3k mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it go rent the original conan dvd instead
