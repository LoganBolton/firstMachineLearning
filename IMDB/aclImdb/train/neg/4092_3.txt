i like fulci films i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of peoplebr br conquest is where fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesnt really succeed structurally its like most fulci films youve seen some stuff happens some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another really its like conan with no sets no script no real actors yes arnold scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either no budget stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gorebr br this one was a hard one to get through and i couldve lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that hair metal music video look
