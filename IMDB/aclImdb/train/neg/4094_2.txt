despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago i have never come across this italian sword and sorcery item on latenight italian tv and now that i have seen it for myself i know exactly why not because of its directors typical predilection for extreme gore of which there is some examples to be sure or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time it is set in the dark ages after allit is quite simply very poor stuff indeed in fact i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and believe me i have seen plenty especially in the last few years ie following my excursion to the 2004 venice film festival reading about how the films failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its directors subsequent and regrettable career nosedive into mindless lowbudget gore i can see their point i may prefer fulcis earlier giallo period 196877 to his more popular stuff horror 197982 myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably unquestionable on the other hand conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least  seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist sprinkle it with incongruent characters cannibals vs werewolves anyone irrelevant gore we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesheating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked brainslurping villainess dont ask and her slimy reptilian pet for what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here a young magic bowcarrying boy on some manhoodaffirming odyssey andrea occhipinti and his rambling musclebound companion jorge rivero ie frenchy from howard hawks rio lobo 1970 who despite being called mace short for maciste perhaps seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protégé out of trouble particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the boils unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as exgoblin claudio simonettis electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness after defeating one and all with the aid of the allimportant magic bowso much for his own supposed physical strength onto his next  and thankfully unfilmed  adventure
