the bad news is its still really dreadful i gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funnybr br its supposed to be better than mulva zombie ass kicker and progress should be rewarded or maybe i was drinking heavily when i watched it and felt generous whatever 2 it isbr br maybe the best thing about this movie is that its over pretty quick it takes elements from most of kill bill i  iis key themes and fight scenes hacks them up dumbs them way down dirties up the dialog and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur videobr br youd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one and get this dvd back to the video store on time youll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee
