a bit of a disappointing film id say the acting was stilted somehow in many cases i just couldnt feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene an angry or sad happy frustrated character should make the viewer believe that hes angry or sad happy frustrated that doesnt happen herebr br the comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt they do things and say things which come out of nowhere the character andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner then he blows up and storms out telling his father dont touch me you f maybe if wed seen the prequel we would understand where all that comes from but there is no prequel so were somewhat at sea as to the reason br br one odd quirky thing that andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry sit down on the edge overlooking the still water below then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up he did this same thing three times during the film i guess were supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry maybe once but three times it might even have been four times i lost countbr br to be honest there is the fact that hes recently found out that hes adopted this happens very early in the film so theres no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery its not really clear if thats why hes so bitter or if its about something elsebr br i guess there is a sort of lynchian feel to the film but should a firsttime director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career
