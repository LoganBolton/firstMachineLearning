you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a halfforgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre settings go its a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i havent been in this flat for two years and were still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day iveneverheardofyou and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing companybr br dead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in adulthood that her letters havent been delivered for one reason or another so logically she gets a job at the dlo and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the selfcontained world of the dead letters office to its kneesbr br nothing against this film but i was reminded of the godawful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that aint difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know theyll never find while other characters are peripheral at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider australias draconian immigration policy ie if you dont speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than oddball stereotypesbr br despite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyones taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes its nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavyduty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there aint any major laughs theres no bullet time and the characters are usually onedimensional but its the story that counts here and while its not earthshattering in its magnificence its a pleasant enough way of passing the time its the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd  nice to listen to now and again but you wouldnt really miss it if it wasnt there
