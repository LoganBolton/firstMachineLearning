the problem with the killer elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director sam peckinpahbr br the already volatile peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film according to at least one biographer this was where he became acquainted with cocaine add to that his binge drinking and its no wonder things fell apartbr br its a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much mike locken james caan and george hansen robert duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the cia they move quick live well and seem like the best of friends  then something happens to shatter their brotherhoodbr br an opening scene shows them blowing up a building  why exactly we arent told par for the course in terms of this films murky motivation but the implication is these guys hurt people and dont really care  antiheroes much like the wild bunch of peckinpahs notsolongago an opening title tells us they work for comteg then adds with obvious tongue in cheek the thought the cia might employ such an organization for any purpose is of course preposterous thats a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are offbr br add to that a traditionally strong peckinpah backup cast including burt young gig young and peckinpah regular bo hopkins in the plum role of a madman who cant pass up an opportunity to be shot at for 500 a day and you only wish that the scriptwriters including the celebrated sterling silliphant tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy oneliners and bad chopsocky knockoffs an attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in youre so busy doing their dirty work you cant tell who the bad guys are someone tells locken as if either he or we need it pointed outbr br worse still are peckinpahs clumsy direction and sluggish pacing were 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we havent even met before are seen fighting at san francisco airport their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suitebr br by the end of the film whats left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed victory ships ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense lay me seventofive ill take the little guy he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors  from china which we all know is the land of the ninja the battle takes place in san francisco but surprisingly no mounties arrive to break things upbr br caan is much better in smaller scenes like when locken recovering from some nasty injuries is told by one of his bosses played by a smooth arthur hill that hes been humptydumped by the organization caan refuses to stay down and his recovery scenes though momentumkilling for the movie feature fine acting from him and amy heflin vans daughter as a supportive nurse caan was one of the 1970s best actors and his laconic byplay with heflin duvall hopkins and both youngs give killer elite real watchabilitybr br but you dont watch killer elite thinking about that you watch it thinking of the film that got away
