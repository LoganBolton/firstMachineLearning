unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate clichéd screenplay hollow man is a rather useless filmbr br practically everything seen here has been done to death  the characters the idea and the action sequences especially the lift shaft  with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by the end of the film that has been done to death also i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme which is hardly original in itself would be the basis of something newer and more interesting this is not so it isnt long before the film turns into an overlyfamiliar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics  the mound of clichés piles up so fast that its almost impressivebr br on top of all this kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score but no competition for his better efforts a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects i was tempted to give this film three out of ten but the effects push hollow mans merit up one notchbr br 410
