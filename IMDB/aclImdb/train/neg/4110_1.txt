its just breathtaking in its awfulness you really must see itbr br depending on your perspective dylan walsh is either the savior or the problem here since hes the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone elses flaws or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulnessbr br im inclined to the later view thanks to him it works as high comedy hes the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball his skill set just doesnt apply in this context and his discombobulation is deliciousbr br the real treat though is ms eastwood whose inability to speak in plain english is so pervasive i actually googled her expecting to learn that she was a russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically with no understanding of their meaning but no shes just a talent free american who will leave you laughing with every line she drops whether she knew what the lines meant must remain an open question
