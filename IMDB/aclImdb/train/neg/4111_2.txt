think of a nobudget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and youll get power play the idea was good but the execution acting and dialog absolutely killed it not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the moviebr br this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake the rather cavalier reporter going up against what shouldve been a more ruthless bunch of company execs is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plants faultsbr br unfortunately there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting not to mention the viewer who may only be attracted to the movie for its action genre appeal is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot emups plus earthquake disaster scenes all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that shouldve propelled the story it mightve been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story creepy villains a naive reporter and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrongdoing afoot it is formulaic but at least it wouldve been entertaining
