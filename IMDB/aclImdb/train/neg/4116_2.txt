my one line summary should explain it all but ill have a go at itbr br from the getgo this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and thats about all i can comment on there were a few interesting scenes such as the big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait whats that the earthquake gasp wait a minute thats dantes peak well parts of it butchered and slapped in i cant believe how poorly this movie was done borrowing scenes from other much better films one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountainesque backdrops exist in downtown la ala dantes peakbr br my advise forget the bond wannabe nash in this film and go for the real thing again someone from dantes peak coincidentallybr br
