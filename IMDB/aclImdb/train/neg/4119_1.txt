i thank god i didnt go to cinema for this film i would be very sorry for the money i gave i saw it on tv and i couldnt beleive my eyes i wonder if any film could be worse than this one they spent millions of dollars to this film for nothing awful acting and awful scenario i think the other people who wrote comments are the man working from that film company  its very big fiasco in year 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of film embarassing
