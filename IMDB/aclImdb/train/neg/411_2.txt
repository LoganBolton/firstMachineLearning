i dont normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i dont like but in a case like this one i just have to say something this movie is terrible illogical and stupid there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i dont even feel obliged to elaborate on because its time for me to move on from this experience the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacons characters madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his conditionbr br granted the special effects are impressive and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff the directors cut of robocop on dvd is great however this movie is stupid and generally doesnt come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoymentbr br  in short as many other reviews here say wish i had read them before  stay away from this film
