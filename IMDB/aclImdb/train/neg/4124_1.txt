nobody knows anybody is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanistnut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week he also happens to be the best friend of the films hero the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game with himself and the hero as players and seville as the virtual environment the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacmantype games looked at this way the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by blackhooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays br br from the start we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game  the heros job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriends father clues are liberally scattered as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant eg the advert in the bar the detectivepaper chase elements are made part of a game in progress rather than an investigation after the fact the film borrows heavily on se7ens pattern narrative and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easterbr br in this reading the game is on the level of narrative with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case the computer to win and save the day but there is a second game the film itself which subvert the first there are another set of of clues which point not to the killers intentions but the filmmakers and his heros in the first ten minutes there are references to chess a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin if we remember that the chessloving nabokovs 1930s pseudonym was sirin we see another game afoot one where we suspect not the villain but the hero himself br br in a nabokov novel like pale fire an authorfigure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted eg the image contracting or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the heros point of view the opening references to games are all linked to him in the early sequences much is made of the characters sexual and creative impotence so the film could be his attempt to master his life to be a winner in a way he cant for real no sooner has he won the game than his writers block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film suggesting he is the overall author further that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero like kinbote trapped in his own solecismbr br this jumble of postmodern literature borges eco pynchon et al are alluded to also fincher xfiles run lola run chris marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present bunuellian anticlericism and alex de la iglesias shock films result in a film that is just that a jumble each cleverclever allusive element cancelling out the last dissipating interest the lack of clarity about the games rules renders it incomprehensible and eventually wearing br br ironically in a work of such overdetermined artifice the films main interest lies in its documentary quality as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like sans soleil or london but ultimately you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness
