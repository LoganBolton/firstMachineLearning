okay ive watched this movie twice now i have researched it heavily on the net i have asked several people on there opinions i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla a book that this movie is supposed to be based on i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it as the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the bookbr br laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully one day they get a letter from the general a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter carmilla for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness who is this mysterious carmilla and just what has she to do with lauras condition and the generalbr br i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are i even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but i cant be bothered with that its called the this movie doesnt make any sense gamebr br all you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening i mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely completebr br it will have to answer such questions as  br br  why can vampires walk around in day lightbr br  why are they all lesbiansbr br  why is a girl called bob and why does she shoot herselfbr br  when is the movie a dream and when is it realbr br  why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelidbr br  why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie toobr br  and why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his carbr br  and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen carbr br what the hell is the asylum scene all aboutbr br  what the hell is the green goo all aboutbr br  why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nursebr br  why are there never any vampires fighting zombiesbr br  what is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know thatbr br in fact sod it its just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie toobr br i have my plot and i have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effortbr br in conclusionbr br vampires vs zombies has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel how why what the hell is going on
