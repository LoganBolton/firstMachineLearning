i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself intobr br i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torturebr br i finally know what hell is like its this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didnt even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happensbr br instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this moviebr br dont even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win
