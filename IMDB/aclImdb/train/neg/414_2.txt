going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac so right away youre guessing who will live and who will die the survivors end up being exactly who youd expect them to be so no points for plot twists therebr br and if youre not sure if this is a bmovie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story william devane plays a part instant bmovie statusbr br the movie is promising in the beginning at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent oooh foreboding the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again great special effects same thing when they make bacon invisiblebr br there are a couple of bare breasts a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an rrating that it really didnt needbr br for a thriller there werent really any surprises except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer which is more of a whaaaa ok there is one surprise thats when caine bacon comes back one last time in the elevator shaft it was a surprise but only because youre yelling at tv noooo youre dead already end the movie speaking of yelling at the tvthats all i did for the last 25 minutes or so put on your fing goggles instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him they try every other trick in the book fire extinguishers sprinkler systemsbr br the story really lost it at the end but the special effects were good thats the only reason i give it a 210
