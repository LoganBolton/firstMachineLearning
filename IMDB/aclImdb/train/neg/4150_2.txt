oh it really really is ive seen films that i disliked more due to whatever reason but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making it even fails to fail at film making in a way the hercules in new york could be said to do its not the film i like the least but it is the very worst film ive ever seenbr br the acting is the first thing that strikes you ive never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography in fact ive plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this it really is awfulbr br technically its terrible the camerawork is amateurish the editing is nonsensical i presume they couldnt afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and theres a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and theres a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again lending more to the bad porn vibebr br the plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out ill defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythosbr br speaking of vampire mythos the writer had evidently read carmilla or at very least seen the vampire lovers im not sure how i feel about this swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel im very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material at very least the general is an insult to peter cushing thoughbr br it gets two stars however merely because i cant bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least purports to have both vampires and zombies in it incidentally i watched lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to thisbr br so in the end this is not a film so bad its good or so bad its in any way enjoyable even drunk its just a mess and worth noones time watching
