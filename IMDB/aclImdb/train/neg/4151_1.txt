this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died br br i cant spoil the ending because i have absolutely no idea what happened ill try my best though there are some kind of lesbian vampires but they keep swapping bodies so any character might or might not be the character youre supposed to think it is or it might be a lesbian vampire br br sound confusing its not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense to begin with theres no plot no character development and random people show up speak a few lines and then disappear never to be heard from again there are also zombies who are possibly the enemies of the vampires but theres also a dreamwithinadream kind of sequence in a mental hospital so maybe none of this actually happened and its all the main characters hallucination br br the upside both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly the special effects are simply mindboggling i particularly liked the incredibly slow awkward fight sequences everyone has a really silly canadian accent which adds to the general level of hilarity br br well worth the price of rental we laughed until we cried
