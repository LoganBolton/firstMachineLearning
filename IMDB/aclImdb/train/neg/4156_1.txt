yes this movie is bad whats worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title in the entire movie zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice on top of that were never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire one might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic but it ends up just boring more than half of this movie takes place in a car the scenes that take place anywhere else arent much to brag about either also theres no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie br br however i will say that for a film this low in production value the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere br br im all for independent films but it doesnt look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any br br worse than scarecrow slayer
