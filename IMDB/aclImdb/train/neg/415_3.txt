leave it to paul sex on the brain verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story if hed direct a pokemon film im sure hed turn it into some massive orgy of sorts i dont mind sex or even sleaze check my other reviews on film but frankly its obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldnt see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it its a shame because it could have been good if the film didnt spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women br br the game cast of actors does what it can with the onenote cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them including william devane who is totally wasted herebr br but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls which btw is much more entertaining than this stilted  bad film
