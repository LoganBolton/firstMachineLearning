this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot aside from the lack of plot the acting was atrocious the special effects were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible the movies only redeeming factor is that its so incredibly bad that its quite funny you cant help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie but its something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about its now a running joke among my friends and i 1 out of 10
