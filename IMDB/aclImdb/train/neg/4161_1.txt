a stuttering plot uninteresting characters and subpar to say the least dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budgetbr br the characters arent believable in their motives actions or their professed occupations the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragonstm hack but with plasma rifles and force fields there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author at least wincing br br avoid it like the plague watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting dialogue and plot yuck
