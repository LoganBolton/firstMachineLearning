i was eager to see mr fix it because im a huge david boreanaz fan what i got though was a 112 hour nap the premise seemed enjoyable boreanaz is lance valenteen proprietor of a business called mr fix it where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them backbr br among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting although ive found boreanaz delightful in his other film roles with the exception of that crow movie he did this was disappointing at times his character was interesting and others flat the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players i realize it wasnt a bigbudget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didnt seem rightbr br my advice watch at your own risk
