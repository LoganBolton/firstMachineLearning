some spoilers  as if you wouldnt know how itll endbr br my expectations for hollow man were high a very good commercial a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue plus a very interesting theme  invisibility every premise for a great movie was accomplished unfortunately these things didnt matter at all the movie was very very week without suspense and awfully predictable br br its all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility after the tests on animals succeeded kevin bacon decides to test it on himself once hes invisible he changes completely realizing the advantages of not being seen from this to murder theres a very thin linebr br hollow man is an ill movie it suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects without giving a damn about the real value of the movie i must admit the fx are awesome probably the best i have seen since matrix but thats not enough to make a movie good actually thats the problem with the movies today just like verhoeven most directors care only about spectacular scenes  and nothing more the exceptions are very few and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plotbr br after starship troopers verhoeven disappoints again in stead of a great film hm is crp there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie 1 the special effects 2 the joke with superman and wonder woman i wont spoil this moment for youbr br okay so what went wrong with the movie everything lets see what i can rememberbr br  its not tensed at all it shouldve been but its notbr br  its too predictable  you know from the beginning who will die and who will livebr br  in stead of focusing on the psychological part verhoeven cares only about the effectsbr br  very many cliches br br  of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dyingbr br  just like in every low quality horror the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible every time there is somebody alone in the lab perfect victim for baconbr br  some holes in the plot example at the beginning bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab after hes invisible how can he do thatbr br  the ending absolutely horriblebr br  after shue hits bacon in the head bacon falls down to the ground then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly without looking back is that normal then bacon gets up attacks them they kill him again and then shue screams i heard an explosion happened minutes ago and they suddenly run inside didnt she hear that explosion some time beforebr br  theres a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors come on mr verhoeven  i expected much more from youbr br so thats about hollow man what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam br br vote 4 out of 10 for the special effects
