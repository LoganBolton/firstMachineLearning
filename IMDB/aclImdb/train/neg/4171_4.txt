id passed this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster looking for something halfway decent to watch all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent thisbr br i will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than dracula 3000 but in actuality thats pretty easy to say since this one didnt have caper van dien in it the other things it lacked in spades were an interesting cast interesting story good dialog and originality but i suppose you cant have everythingbr br spoilers ahead the misfit crew of vampire hunters one of which was a vampire go figure flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find the crew consists of the cocky neerdowell captain who dies early on his bythebook yet inexperienced first mate the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter not a typo a wannabe cowboy and a really really butch asian commando tough guy female it almost sounds like the cast for mtvs the real world after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers and as it turns out lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy his first mate takes over blah blah blah everyone hates him blah blah blah i could go on but as i said its the same storyline used in about a hundred other films of the genrebr br the effects were cheese and why michael ironside was in this movie is beyond me the vampire vampire hunter still not a typo was pretty hot but of course if youre waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage look elsewherebr br i cant say that it was the worst film ive seen as i actually rented starship troopers 2 but wait for this one to come on the scifi channel
