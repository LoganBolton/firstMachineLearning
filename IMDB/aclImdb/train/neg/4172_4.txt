although it really isnt such a terribly movie especially considering it was made directly for tvdistribution itll be very difficult to point out one aspect in bloodsuckers that is actually original or refreshing vampires in space isnt exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting still no one seems to realize its an incredibly stupid premise that cant possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie bloodsuckers even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare the plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from john carpenters ghosts of mars and james camerons aliens as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons like the voorhees and the leatherfaces the good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters captain damian is the unpopular rookie wholl really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous and far more loved captain churchill the other annoying characters include a typical cowboystyle and trigger happy macho pilot a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board shes of asian descent like the girl in aliens was latino and the armys most valuable secret weapon a bladegirl quintana is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans she can spot enemies when theyre still lightyears away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someones wet dreams they eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampiremeanie michael ironside in yet another downgrading role bloodsuckers is an irredeemably stupid film but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings infantile dialogs and ott makeup effects it only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla this film is a nonstop series of lame clichés and uncreative ideas but at least its watchable
