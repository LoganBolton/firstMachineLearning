whooboy that was definitely one of the worst flicks ive seen all summer granted it was on sci fi and i dont watch much sci fi but man talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the maxbr br the characters were stereotypical and overdone the plot and setting were unbelievable the vampires were less intimidating more funnylooking the gore was unnecessary the special effects were downright horrible and the ending well the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire which by the way isnt really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds in which youre closer to what the hell then man thats hot if this ever appears in reruns god forbid dont watch it
