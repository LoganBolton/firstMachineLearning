perhaps i missed the meeting when the meaning of bmovie was explained but what i just saw was ridiculous you want a good synopsis of this movie take aliens replace the xenomorphs with vampires then remove everything that was good about it and thats pretty much itbr br 5 minutes into the movie the vsan squad thats the dumbest acronym ive ever heard checks out a base thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down down what a ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious present day train in the background when is this supposed to take place 2210 okayhold on ill get back to thatbr br yeah the characters wow well theres the token lesbian asian chick the redneck cowboy wannabe the weathered captain the goth vampirehot topic parttime cashier and the wussy noob second in command all of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition it almost pained me to see micheal ironside in this flick isnt he getting enough money being the voice of sam fisher in splinter cell pretty much the only thing original about vampire wars is about how bad it isbr br watching this afterbirth of a film the only amusement i got was from the feeble attempts at setmaking since when does taping pci computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship the money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use
