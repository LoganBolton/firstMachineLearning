i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales well for the previous it is better than daytime televisionthough im not sure how muchbr br it does have its points but after about the first 2030 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together in short a terrible sci fi channel type moviebr br it has its points such as the future is dirty like blade runner showed  of course this is no blade runner the captain looks sort of feels like actor robert forster the kind of person one might want to be aroundbr br but unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of aliens the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified and the new captain might as well be like janmichael vincent running around on danger island in the banana splits he only put on the uniform with the epaulets hes got very little right to it all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the eureka maru as they are fighting a class of people who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualitiesjust like the nietzcheans in andromedabr br it might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot he probably had fun doing it but it doesnt help the movie muchbr br its  okay okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel one might watch it once  but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it allbr br for me that was the femme fatale  when she was fighting
