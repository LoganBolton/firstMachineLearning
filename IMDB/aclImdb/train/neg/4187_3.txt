a film written and directed by neil young greendale is little more than an 87minute music video set to a doxen or so of the songwriters works in lieu of dialogue the film relies exclusively on youngs lyrics which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary to tell the story while actors act out the scenesbr br given the hammy performances and the shoddy graininess of the picture the effect is the equivalent of young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption although there is allegedly a story running through the film we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting all we get for eightyseven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent narrative while youngs songs play endlessly on the soundtrack the whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in selfindulgence greendale gives offhollywood low budget moviemaking a bad name
