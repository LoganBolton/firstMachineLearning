im a big mark for the music of neil young and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many altindie press circles hit the first showing of greendale i could find my excitement was shortlived as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointedbr br neil says the film started as a soundtrack and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack not the best way to craft a story no character really has an arc and when significant events do happen the viewer doesnt cared because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point the film is all song and to that end the characters on end mouth the lyrics as theyre sungthe technique works for the first stanza it is done and is grating on the nerves after that it doesnt feel real or fake it just feels unwelcomebr br terrible acting with characters finding one mood and playing all of it poor lighting at times the only kudos i can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it an alright soundtrack but nothing im quick to buy a bad film
