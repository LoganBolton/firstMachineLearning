i had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of 2004s worst films back to back this morning first the incoherent cgidriven emptiness of the chronicles of riddick and then the embarrassing vanity project known as greendale one cost multimillions and the other cost pennies but theyre both bad really really bad br br up front i should state im not the worlds biggest neil young fan but he has contributed his share of classic tunes from buffalo springfield whose best recordings were young compositions to rust never sleeps harvest and mirror ball the man has penned some really great songs sadly there are no great songs in greendale and precious few good ones and the film around which they are built is truly cringeworthy and simplistic political sloganeering completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic greendale is best left forgotten buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to youngs bank account
