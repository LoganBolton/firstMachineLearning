i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie which is the only reason i went to see it another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away his editorial comment in his forward is a good summarybr br yukbr br unless youre a neil young fan or live innear greendale if the latter you know the real name skip this movie its mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker it has no discernible plot the music is merely ok and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may bebr br i dont need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give awaybr br id give this a 1510 but thats just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie it wasnt worth the 6 i could rent a video camera and drive around greendale and make a better movie myselfbr br if you want to see a good environmentalmessage movie with no plot go rent koyaanisqatsi
