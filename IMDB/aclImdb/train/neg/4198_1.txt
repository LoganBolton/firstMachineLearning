i caught this cuban film at at an arthouse film club it was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 silly symphony cartoon where the isle of symphony is reconciled with the isle of jazz what with the recently deceased ruben gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinemaballroom and a cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of helmsburton but then the film started and the cinemas peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess onscreenbr br the storyline of nada mas promises much carla is a bored envelopestamper at a cuban post office her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them transforming basic interpersonal grunts into brontÃ«an outbursts of breathless emotion cue numerous shots of photogenic cubans gushing with joy grief pity terror and the likebr br the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into filmschool artiness latino caricature marx brothers slapstick and even  during a particularly underwhelming editing trick  the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a characters facebr br unidimensional characters abound cunda the boss at the post office is a humourless dominatrixnosferatu her bosseyed accomplice concha variously points fingers eavesdrops and screeches cesar the metalhead dolt and romantic interest reveals hidden writing talent when carla departs for miami a chase scene in ohsohilarious fastforward is thrown in for good measure all this would be fine in a mortadello and filemon comic strip but in a blackandwhite zerofx flick with highbrow pretensions ahembr br nada mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the quirkyheroinematchmakesstrangers of amelie and the poetryasgreatredeemer theme of il postino like amelie its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers and like il postino the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead unfortunately nada mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either filmbr br there are two things that might merit watching this film in a latenight tv stupor the first is the opening overhead shot of carla on a checkertiled floor which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on the second is to see nada mas as a cautionary example our post buena vista social club obsession with cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack this film should not have merited a global release  films such as waiting list and guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully
