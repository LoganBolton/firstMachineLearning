how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you cant stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so ill just add a few things on the hilarity of it allbr br some reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyesbr br one of the freakiest moments in the film is when pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on thats actually funny and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and pablito kicks it a bit for what i assume is shits n giggles and the eyes actually movebr br but of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just badbr br i hadnt laughed like this in a loooong while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film youll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though dont bother
