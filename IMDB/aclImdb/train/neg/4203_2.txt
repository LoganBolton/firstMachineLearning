what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns almost instantaneously into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not humanly possiblebr br what for instance causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommys parents house why would heinrich although admittedly a sleezebag want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why wouldnt he go to the police and why didnt gale activate the alarm when she got home especially after scolding howie about it being off of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and i use the term very very loosely to unfold and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy but everything from howies description of his date rape to the coroners misidentification of gale to the final joke about gale and howie still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything elsebr br i checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers but theres nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven
