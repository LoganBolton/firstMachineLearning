i was at this films premiere at the toronto film festival in 1997 after the screening when the writerdirector and some cast members offered to answer questions no one could even be bothered to ask any rarely has a film been so poorly directed why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes wretchedly acted david arquette to paraphrase dorothy parker does not run the emotional gamut from a to b he parks at a and brings a lunch and utterly pointless characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions at long last the film comes to a completely random and pointless end thats supposed to really make you think unfortunately what it makes you think is well theres 90 minutes of my life im never getting back
