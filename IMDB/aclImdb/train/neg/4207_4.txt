ghost town starts as kate barrett catherine hickland drives along an isolated desert road her car suddenly breaks down  she hears horses hoofs approaching deputy sheriff langley frank luz of riverton county is called in to investigate kates disappearance after her father reports her missing he finds her broken down car  drives off looking for her unfortunately his car breaks down too  he has to walk langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town much to his shock langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as its populated by the ghosts of its former residents  is run by the evil devlin jimmie f skaggs who has kidnapped kate for reasons never explained  its up to langley to rescue her  end the towns cursebr br the one  only directorial effort of richard governor this odd film didnt really do much for me  i didnt like it all that much the script by duke sandefur tries to mix the horror  western genres which it doesnt do to any great effect have you ever wondered why there arent more horror western hybrid films out there well neither have i but if i were to ask myself such a question i would find all the answers in ghost town because its not very good the two genres just dont mix that well there are plenty of clich√©s on the western side of things theres the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them the shootouts in the main street saloon bars with swing doors  prostitutes upstairs  horror wise theres plenty of cobwebs some ghosts an ancient curse talking corpses  a few violent kills i was just very underwhelmed by it i suppose theres nothing terribly wrong with it other than its just dull  the two genres dont sit together that well there are a few holes in the plot too why did devlin kidnap kate i know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that  what was he going to do with her anyway we never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either i mean whats keeping them there  what caused them to come back as ghosts then theres the bit at the end where devlin after being shot says he cant be killed only for langley to kill him a few seconds later i mean why didnt the bullets work in the first placebr br director governor does alright theres a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets  the standard hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it i wouldnt say its scary because it isnt theres not much tension either  the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length forget about any gore there a few bloody gunshot wounds an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit  someone is impaled with a metal pole  thats itbr br id have imagined the budget was pretty small here its reasonably well made  is competent if nothing else credit where credits due the period costumes  sets are pretty good actually the acting is alright but noones going to win any awardsbr br ghost town is a strange film im not really sure who its meant to appeal to  it certainly didnt appeal to me anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements its something a bit different but that doesnt mean its any good worth a watch if your desperate but dont bust a gut to see it
