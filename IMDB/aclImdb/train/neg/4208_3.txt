there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is the pagemasterbr br i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out but this time i found that the special effects are quite good the plot is just the neverending story with a creativityendectomy but its an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eyecandy the animation is amazing and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm im giving it a grade of three as i would have given it a two just for parody value if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind storywise
