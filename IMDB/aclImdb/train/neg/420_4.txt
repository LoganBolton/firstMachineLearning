for those whod like to see this movie id say go without the narration it might be a very good moviedocumentary but the music the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap were watching but the melodramatic point of view just doesnt cut it for me moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey one exception left there the camera zooms out or skips to another scene i ask myself why that happens if they were to show reality why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet
