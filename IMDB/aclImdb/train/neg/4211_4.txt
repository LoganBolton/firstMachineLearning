about 4 years ago i liked this movie i would watch it over and over and over but now i dont actually i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000 it has a bunch of commentheavy actors macaulay culkin christopher lloyd patrick stewart whoopi goldberg and a pretty cheesy plot my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says hey tyler where ya goin the moon also look out for the classic line do you have feeling in your toesbr br on the other hand its better than the good son
