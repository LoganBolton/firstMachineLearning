another day stuck indoors another film to watch having finally completed my christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon i had nowhere else to go to escape the land that time forgot or rather i had nothing else to watchbr br doug mcclure that bastion of leadingman actors leads a handful of allied sailors sunk by a uboat somewhere in the atlantic in 1916 capturing the uboat in a scene that defies logic and reason they eventually find themselves on a strange island apparently untouched by human hands together they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and neanderthals can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that time forgot br br despite being made few years before star wars these films are lightyears apart in terms of special effects the model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of gerry andersons stingray and the creatures arent much better either when the trex im assuming thats what it was was killed it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them  frozen in midwalk and collapsing arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow thats been pushed over granted the sets arent too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises which all sound the same do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves in the end i just didnt care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came i was more relieved than entertainedbr br costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bearskin bikinis and loin cloths all round and although it was fairly obvious from their actions you wouldnt have known that some characters were german from their accents the whole thing just lacked some polish and cohesion leaving the viewer confused in places and nonplussed in others overall this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where colin farrell is i spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an irish accent and suspect facial hair oh well nothing particularly great here to see then but just about ok if youre eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity
