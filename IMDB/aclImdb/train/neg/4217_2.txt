this was recently on amcs vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of voyage to the earths core and mysterious island i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year olds comic book be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the pterdactyls wings when they grasp ogar a half idiot premodern man who befriends the lost adventurers the ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in people that time forgot dont waste your time
