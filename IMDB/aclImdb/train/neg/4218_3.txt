this isnt one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested inbr br the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members and two civilians the hero and heroine who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaursbr br the manipulations arent so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isnt going to be high what films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actionsbr br this film lacks both for a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into mcclures hero is beyond routine and doesnt make much sense in any erabr br the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the riddle is not much of a riddle and we could care lessbr br a lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time
