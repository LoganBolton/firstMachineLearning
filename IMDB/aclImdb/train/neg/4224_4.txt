star rating  the works  just misses the mark  that little bit in between  lagging behind  the pits br br in this debut effort for nick parks beloved man and dog they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheesebr br as well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes this wg adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the boxbr br admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is ive never actually been hugely into wallace  gromit maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation the only one ive really enjoyed is the wrong trousers and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of shall we say the seedier pleasures of life i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptationbr br as technically impressive as the first two all things considered this one lacks the emotional angle its successors were to possess that being said its fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come two stars but a good two stars
