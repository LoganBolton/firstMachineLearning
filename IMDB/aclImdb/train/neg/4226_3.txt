wowi cant believe just how bad zombie doom aka violent sht 3 really is id heard the rumors read the reviews  but had to make my mind up for myself well let me tell ya  it blows the worst acting of any film ever made dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted inept and laughable gore fx no discernible plot cinematography that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder weapons props that are no joke  made out of tinfoil  the list goes on and onbr br three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tinfoil swords two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks and are given a days head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the tribethats pretty much itbr br honestly  this is one of the worst films ive ever had the misfortune to subject myself too the budget had to be about 200 and was spent entirely on the gore fx which actually may not have been a bad idea there is nothing to zombie doom other than strungtogether ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog this film makes other nobudget outings like premutos lord of the living dead look like titanic some may rank zd in the sobaditsgood category  and i guess if youre really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst3kstyle  i guess it could be looked at that way but not by me i hated pretty much everything about it if zombie doom or zombie 90 which is equally appalling and is included as a bonus on the shockorama release of zd is indicative of andreas schnaas other works  then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death there is one amusing kungfu battle in the latter half of the film and a lot of blood  so ill grant this one a very generous 310  do yourself a favor and skip this
