i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this i love independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general but when you add ningas youve crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it wasnt a total waste youd never know by watching it though script are you kidding acting i think even the trees were faking cinematography well there mustve been a camera there period i dont think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie such a total waste of time that i wont prolong it by commenting further
