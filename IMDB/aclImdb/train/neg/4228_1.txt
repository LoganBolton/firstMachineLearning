i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is i want my 399 back words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actors mouths the movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970s vintage camcorder i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped then tried to put on a play in your garage dont get me wrongi wasnt expecting oneil and i love zombie movies but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable avoid
