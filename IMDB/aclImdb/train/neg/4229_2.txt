i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on this has to be the worst piece of monkey st i have ever seen i ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but i got bored and turned it offlets seebr br the wardrobe consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot the masks were made from what looks like tin foil br br the gore the gore was pretty good i must give it that but ittenbachs burning moon was better for a low budget movie br br acting was horrible i didnt mind the dubbing i find this humorous like in ittenbachs premutos great movie the fighting and action sequences were pi poorbr br bottom line dont watch any of schnaass movies there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter check premutos house of blood schramm and the nekromantiks
