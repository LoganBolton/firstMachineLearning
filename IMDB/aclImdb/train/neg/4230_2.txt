ok i like b moviesi know what b movies are supposed to represent but this is just awful i am amazed it got such a decent overall score the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the mostly marginal splatter effects dont get me wrong gore abounds in this flick  but few effects really jumped out at me like the anal probethat was greatbr br i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder cmon  rent a betacam at least ive seen porn with better production values and better acting as wellbr br acting  sucked but not in the troma or full moon sort of waybr br story  contrived but thats what you get from films like these very loosebr br sets  props  sucked my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloweenbr br dubbing and dialogue  sucked horrible voice acting i shouldnt even call it acting and every other word is st or fkbr br there are tons of good classic and b rated horror  splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap
