its not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is its pretty amusing the plot is lame but the kills are not too bad i have to be honest if you dont follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do i knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin with friends backstageits not made to be taken seriously its ubber cheese at its punk best and with over 100 killsmost of which are ultra gory its a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry
