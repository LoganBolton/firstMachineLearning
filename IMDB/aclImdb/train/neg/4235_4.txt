i just finished watching this movie i was very excited since im a big fan of punk rock horror films and spoofs i was very surprised at what i saw i knew it was low budget but i wasnt expecting it to be taped with a video camera it opens with a good song and a great very underrated band the horrorpops reforming their song where they wander and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways its a great opening but the problem is the fact that up until the end this was really all that the movie was a live performance a death another live performance a death it gets old and there is a grossliterally overuse of intestines in the death scenes why doesnt the killer use other body parts like legs or eyeballs or brains dont get me wrong this movie has some parts that are awesome like the hardcore french band known simply as beret the prospect of a band named atticus the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together since neither bands had enough members to play their show and bowling for soups overweightandproudofit guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner that i will save for the future watchers of this movie but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical but after a while terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the actors especially warped tour creator kevin lyman he tries very hard but i suspect that he didnt want to make the film but was contractually obligated or something in addition to that the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd the movies resolving plot is very hazy and very random something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil bottom line this movie has a lot of good qualities but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror music or comedy film although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to otherwise such as tsunami bomb and the phenomonautsan insane psychobilly band i recommend that you rent this movie watch the first 10 or 20 minutes if you like it watch the next 20 or 30 if you still like it then watch on if not just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances they rock long live punk rock and horror
