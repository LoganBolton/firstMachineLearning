well if you like poppunk punk ska and a tad bit of modern psycho billy then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching this movie has tons and tons of band cameos along with president of troma lloyd kaufman as a semimajor role and lots of goofy death scenes sounds like it may be good right well the deaths keep coming and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event some of the deaths start of stylish but then they are recycled over and over to the point of being completely repetitive almost everyone dies of having their head smashed or intestines being pulled from their stomach the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas zombie 90 extreme pestilence with this being the watereddown type blood but now that movie is actually decent and provides humorsomething that this movie terribly lacks sure the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma its got great lowbudget potential and it triesbut just too hard everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie and thats what brings it down everything tries to be too comic and goofy by using intentional bad acting an overuse of pointless deaths and doing the same thingover and over its basically mulva zombie asskicker chairman of the board or any movie you have made with your friends its funny to those who made it and thats about itbr br great potential great idea great use of effectsbut its the same thingover and over a band plays a band dies fans die everyone dies blood is sprayed everywhere the process is repeatedbr br the question is for these types of movieswhich is basically bad slapstickdo they try too hard or not at all
