judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at its time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxbr br to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsbr br the film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculousbr br one wonders why anil doesnt buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he isbr br the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80s the johny paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesnt fit in the storybr br even there are several cringeworthy scenesbr br direction by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedbr br anil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny paresh irritates farida is decent
