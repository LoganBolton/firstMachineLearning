this was a better than average movie i thought for it being on cable i had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as christmas rush or first daughtertargetshot etcbr br the cast was well choseni especially liked ron livingston as the hard pressed swat commander its good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in band of brothers the producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997br br so if you get a chance to see this film and i am sure you will since fx reruns everything 50 timestake 2 hours and enjoy it
