i dont know why but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movieall the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programsit has been repackaged with sappy narration and overdramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth daythere are great moments and it is always nice to listen to darth vaderoops james earl jones speak but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie  considering the new camera technology used in the making of this filmit has been sanitized for a child audience so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi sic and this movie is certainly not it
