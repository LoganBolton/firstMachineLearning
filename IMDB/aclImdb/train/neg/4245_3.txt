this movie was based on actual fact i sincerely hope notbr br we get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torsos thats a great idea aim for the armorexcuse me but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud or were there invisible tanks protecting them were they from cryptondid i miss something herebr br this movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shootout it really takes a turn to boringlanebr br and that documentary style didnt work for me either but thats just something one finds likable or notbr br highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through til the endbr br 310 for the fine editing
