i didnt even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade trinity i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the crap thats blade so i did my quick research checked the scores on imdb  rottentomatoes for dracula ascension and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000 i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeingbr br now lets take a quick personal recap here i remember seeing dracula 2000 and i remember not liking it at all and then seeing the scores of dracula ascension just lowered my expectations even more but then again im the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself any movie so that i can form my own opinionbr br a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that its low budget so because of that im going to have to ignore a lot of the vfx and just figure its going to compensated by story  acting i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie jason london roy schieder  jason scott leebr br oh geez this movie was cheesy but cheesy can be entertaining at least i found it pretty fricken laughable the bad audio synch from the rerecording of dialogue in a few scenes the stupidity of the characters in this movie sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things luke even had a book on it but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get infected nope this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel onbr br i also mustve blinked at some point because im not sure how dracula got clothes on his body especially since hes big wild and angry  i figure if i was in that situation i wouldnt want to be the one dressing himbr br so the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy it doesnt instead its a cliff hangar where i now get to wait for the 3rd installment legacy oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies
