possible spoilersbr br when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like not too high but not low either this was nothing like i expected at all though it seems to me like the movie makers couldnt make up their mind of what kind of movie to makebr br in the begining of the film its somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting but thatll soon change to some ridiculous scenes  very obvious scenes as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of timesbr br the ending is the most ridiculous of all though almost splattercomedybr br im not saying it doesnt have some good scenes its just that the film never becomes wholebr br 410 movieman
