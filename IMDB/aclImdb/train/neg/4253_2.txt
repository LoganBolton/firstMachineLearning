this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story apparantly not such a difficult task first of all a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch this one lacks all these things too much light  the spots oh my god why in the name of christjudas was that aboutbr br every time dracula came about he was devoured by light in the script to keep him weak for the record just weak there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching near the ending of the movie beatiful dancingscene with dracula and his new conquest i really enjoyed the first one the judastwist was defintely original but this ones just not good not in any way hopefully the third one will cary the vampiresignature i like so much in other classics like herzogs nosferatu coppolas dracula or even interview with the vampire
