i cant believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdbbr br this disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary miniseries i just paid 875 to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voiceover and 90 seconds of sailfish that i dont believe were in planet earthbr br but the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar bears demise they show his cubs grown significantly a year later and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we dont get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earthbr br i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life
