certainly nomad has some of the best horse riding scenes swordplay and scrumptious landscape cinematography youll likely see but this isnt what makes a film good it helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things and thats where nomad wandersbr br the story is stilted giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a cool movie that looks great not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place and its blatantly obvious with names like lee and hernandez if movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the jugars and the kazaks they damn well better use actorsactresses that look the partbr br warring tribes a prophecy brotherly love and respect a love interest that separates our heroes are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence the next action horse scene or the breathtaking beauty of the landscapebr br it is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to nomad during its filming specifically the director and cinematographer ivan passer director was replaced by sergei bodrov and ueli steiger cinematographer was replaced by dan laustsen in one respect laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here definitely a good thing however the changing over to bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice from what im seeing here the focus is on the battles and not the people which i sense comes from bodrovs eyes and not passers a true travestybr br the most shameful aspect is that this couldve been a really fantastic film with both character and action focuses unfortunately the higherups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap intellectually speaking way outbr br even though i cant give this film a positive rating it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work but thats all
