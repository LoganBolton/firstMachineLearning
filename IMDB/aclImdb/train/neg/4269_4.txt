sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attentiondeficit disorder it devolves into an incongruous mess and for three wellrespected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shamebr br so lets see premise a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the encroaching cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and its a proved ticket to a successful thrillerbr br now herein lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality amp up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme  an ultra bad variation of every other supervillain thats hit cinemas since the silent agebr br the producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film  badly made with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that theyve essayed before and nothing much amounting to even less
