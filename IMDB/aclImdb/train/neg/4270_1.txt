this is another typical unbelievable and nonsensical piece of hollywood dreckbr br kurt russell as snake pliskin in a business suit convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self and does little to be a convincing victimbr br every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something knocking him down and out kurt and madeline then do their obligatory endofthemovie embrace and everybody except russell and stowe knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple againbr br he does of course and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm which was entirely unnecessary this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence and the more they can add or enhance the more slobbery they get
