typical thriller has been done many times before simple plot outline cop liotta becomes obsessed with russells wife and he tries to bump off good ol kurt so he can have her this is beyond predictable it doesnt even try to make you guess the plot is the plot and theres no thinking outside the box here i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops but nothing is done originally or interestingly theres not really anything to say about this film its not particularly bad but theres no good points either russell plays russell and you know what youre gonna get when you see him in a film ditto liotta stowe has an annoying cheresque voice i read the plot outline and i could see the film in my head it was so obvious and basic i watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as i had imagined i felt not a drop of emotion throughout i have no feeling towards this film its as if i never even watched it considering this its a pretty pointless film isnt it still ill give it 310 for some reason
