we are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor we may confess the truth of what we see without being stupid confess that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real conceptbr br well obviously many people like such stuff i dont i prefer well thought and planed shows and i also confess that the show is much to serious for my taste and boringthose love and drug storiesthere are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense dallas eg but twin peaks cant catch my attention i dont care about those people except cooper and gordon cole
