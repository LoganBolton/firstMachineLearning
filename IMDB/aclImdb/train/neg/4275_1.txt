i cant understand why so many peoples praised this show twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my lifebr br now i have seen all season 1 episodes and seeing season 2 episode 1 simply i cant take this show anymorebr br 1 where is the proper induction in criminal investigationbr br in season 1 there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle can you guess why he did that he just want to identify murderer by doing this joke while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream wowbr br 2 there are too many unnecessary scenes in this showbr br for example season 2 started with a funny scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor he got the gun shoots in his belly already  this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments thats allbr br this scene is really boring and even long  3 min 30 sec its like hell br br i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore
