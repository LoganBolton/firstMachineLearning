just picked up this film for a buck at national wholesale liquidators and after watching it i feel like i got rippedoffbr br i dont know that ive seen a worse film than this honestly and i would never write a negative review of a film had i not such enormous respect for the subject matter that is stephen foster and his musicbr br first what is it its a musical biography yeah lots of tunes by foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudobroadwayjerome kerntype numbers that reek more than the mississippi delta i mean somebody got paid to write this drivel secondly the real story of foster is a fascinating one why not even come close to it thirdly what did they have on the great ray middleton to get him to do this film pictures of him with small boys with communists what a waste of a great talentbr br so friends of foster and the truth and good entertainment be afraid be very very afraid
