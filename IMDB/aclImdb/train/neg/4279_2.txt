i found a dvd of i dream of jeanie in the 100 bin at walmart when i saw that it was the story of stephen foster being a musician and music educator i had to see it i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover just that it was a remake of 1939s sewanee river bill shirleys portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful sometimes laughable the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songswithout paying him for them in addition to that ridiculous notion there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his blackfaced christy minstrels performing stephen fosters songs that was difficult to watch to say the least i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten fortunately stephen fosters songs will never be forgottenalso eileen christys portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history
