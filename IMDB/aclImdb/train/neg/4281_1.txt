this movie can be labeled as a study case its not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and nonartistic lust for anything that might be termed as cacoimagery the author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills moldavia is the most pauper region of europe i dont believe one iota in the birds flu romanian people steal because they are poor europeans steal because they are thieves are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude  but he is sorely offtarget br br what daneliuc doesnt know is that its not enough to pose as a righteous person  you also need a modicum of professionalism talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product fatefully the foreign legion shows as much acumen as a family video with uncle gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guests the script is chaotic and incoherent randomly bustling together sundry halfsubjects in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story the direction is pathetically dilettante  the socalled director is unable to build up at least a mediocre miseenscene his shots are annoyingly awkward and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence of course any comment is forced to stop at this level it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as cinematographic language means of expression or style the acting is positively cântarea româniei romanias chant level with the exception of paradoxically the soccer goalkeeper necula raducanu who is very natural and nicodim ungureanu oana piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness but she is compromised by the amateurish directions given by daneliucbr br the most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget via cnc the national cinematography council the fact that longtimedead old dinosaurs like daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable in a marketdriven economy they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection but the corruption of the socalled jury that squanders the countrys money on such ridiculously scabrous nonart noncinema and nonculture belongs to the criminal field
