sadly its true legiunea sträinä exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliucs irreversible failurebr br as it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least storyline the scripts level is similar to a cântarea româniei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism  only turned upside down while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology the ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten levelbr br unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets he isnt able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar his level of storytelling in filmimages is similar to phrasing something like holy sheet man it aint nuthin right ere and all da people is asses what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 19761984 who had created unique works as cursa proba de microfon vânätoarea de vulpi  and even croaziera and glissando sic transit gloria mundi
