this is pretty much the first jason scott lee film ive seen i say pretty much because i have also seen soldier in which he plays the villain but from what ive heard its not considered a jason scott lee film this however is and if this is any indication of the quality of such films i wont be seeing any of the others lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist as the lead hes awful he gets in a fight with random noname characters every few minutes of the film probably because the script writer couldnt figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film the villain is the only character with even a hint of personality and aside from the fact that hes certifiably insane he barely seems like a villain at all the majority of the film is basically lee chasing the villain through time or maybe its the other way around i cant say for sure and i definitely wouldnt watch it again to make sure the effects are not completely horrible but its close the title comes from the popular idea of using a timemachine to go and kill hitler somehow the film screws up that interesting idea as well the plot is too complicated for its own good the pacing is poor i cant think of one positive thing to say about this film i really cant its simply too formulaic and pointless if only i had a timemachine so i could go back and prevent this film from ever being made no never mind i just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible listen to the negative reviewers avoid this turkey i recommend this to fans of lee and no one else if youre looking for a quality film well this isnt it thats for sure 110
