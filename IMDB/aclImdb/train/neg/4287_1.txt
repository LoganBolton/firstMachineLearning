i gave timecop a perfect 10 i gave this 1br br its story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original timecop lots of things from timecop was scrapped and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in 2060 if i remember correctly but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous confusedbr br and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them arent only the first one is great and there arent many action scenes at all and theyre all pretty shortbr br at one point in the story the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes no wait make that two timesbr br in short dont waste time watching this movie its not worth it
