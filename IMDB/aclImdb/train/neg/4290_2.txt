ill give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography otherwise it teems mainly with clich√©s and stereotypes mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind or wise white indians indians are magical people who move around without a sound can disappear in the blink of an eye talk to animals and read minds over large distances and so on and so forthbr br throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains log cabins woods an assortment of animals freespirited mountaindwellers and freaky people in churchbr br the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth this was neither a story about growing up during the depression nor about about being an orphan nor about a struggle for identity it tried to be all of those things and more which made it superficial and unsatisfactorybr br although the movie was supposed to be about little trees education we learn almost nothing about it he was given a brief summary of the history of his people who were brave and stoic and a distillery demonstration tried his hand at chopping wood at which he failed and whiskey running literally learned how to read and maybe to write with the help of grandma and her dictionary  and that was it apparently he didnt learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the atticbr br however grandma and grandpa and graham greenes character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult  after and im paraphrasing here riding with the navajos and getting caught up in a couple of wars  was to catch up with grandma and grandpa and graham greenes character in heaven instead of say dating girls getting married having children or other such nonsensebr br last but not least i must say that i found grandpas trade offensive why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still to counteract the stereotype of the drunken indian
