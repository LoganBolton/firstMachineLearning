this is yet another depressing and boring film about aids and tragedy it begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie i kept waiting for it to pickup but unfortunately it never did the acting is fair but the script needs a lot of work and if youre looking for the nudity dont waste your time with these not so hot actors due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions i missed 18 of the movie if you have never seen over five gay films or have recently come to terms with being gay you may find this film interesting otherwise its your runofthemill low budget movie it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen
