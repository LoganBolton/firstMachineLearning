i was going to say this was the worst gaythemed film ive ever seen but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre ive ever seenbr br you know youre in trouble when a movie starts with a personal note from the director asking for the audiences understanding for the many challenges facing a firsttime director the audio track is so bad in many scenes its almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a dvd version bad lighting bad sets bad photography poor script generally bad acting all add up to make this film unwatchable i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased im sure there are many challenges facing a firsttime director but dont try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale but also the only thats the one positive thing i can say about this alleged movie
