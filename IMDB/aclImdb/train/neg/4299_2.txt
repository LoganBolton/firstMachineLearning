this is one of those awful sexdriven bmovies that couldnt have played anywhere near a theater women run around dressed in scantily clad bunny outfits an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an oddball son jim hanks who is of course toms brother whom the man wants to get laid hanks is actually sort of good but this movie goes nowhere and has no point one must wonder why it was even made nevertheless because of hanks performance and a few entertaining momentsbut no more than a few it received a stellar 2 out of 10 i think i was being nice though
