i saw this film a while ago on a video cdbr br i will 1st mention the good pointsbr br the movie at first at least tries to appear that it is not biased like not showing one character as black and the other as white both main characters are friends and coexist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport sport rifle shooting as comrades not as competitorsbr br but after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict sure the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war beganbr br the history the 1990 elections the people who caused the war are not mentioned the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliaments 2nd largest partysdp according to the constitution of bosnia the sdp was to have the presidency in 1992 but there was a coup in january the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secessionbr br the history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic a man suspiciously absent from stth he was a student of nazism in ww2 he even wrote his own mein kampf in which he stated it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between the islamic religion and nonislamic social and political institutionsbr br in 1990 he lost the idap elections to proyugoslavia moderate fikret abdic a bosnian muslim that worked with christian serbs during the civil war and who treated his supporters like brothers abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic who lost the elections but seized the seat of powerbr br the events from above are missing from the movie but they are the factual events that lead to the warbr br there were problems with props too serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 helmets which they did not use also the one soldier was holding an m1944 ww2 rifle only used by ussr not yugoslaviabr br the director and script writers had a chance but they chose to rewrite history
