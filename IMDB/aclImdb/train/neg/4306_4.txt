there is one good thing in this movie lola glaudinis ass sorry to be so blunt but its the truth too bad she didnt do a nude it would at least have made this mess tolerable we see another chicks boobs but shes nowhere near lola and man is armand assante old or what the man looks like crap consequence is the usual bmovie you would expect the story had potential its like they had good ideas but didnt know how to execute them the cinematography is just plain awful ugly the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap slutty way but not even she saves consequence from being trash and not funny trash just plain old stinking trash
