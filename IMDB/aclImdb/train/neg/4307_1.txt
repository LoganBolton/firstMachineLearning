seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable it prompted me to exclaim oh my god more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain sillybr br fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable near impossible human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they existbr br if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of timebr br that a film released in 2003 is already being shown on tv in july 2003 might give an indication of the films quality
