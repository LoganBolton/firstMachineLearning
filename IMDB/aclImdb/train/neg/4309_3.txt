a high school principal keenan wynn with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman cathy lee crosby but a catalyst for their new winning ways are you really surprised along the way a romance grows between the coach and the teams star player jack michael biehn the police are never notifiedbr br packaged along with other crown international pictures as a grindhouse movie really does this film no service this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week cathy lee crosby looks great as coach randy rawlings especially in her skimpy outfits but i expected more than mere titillation from an rrated film a side plot involving a dorky center who is hypnotized by his teammates into thinking he is former nba player sydney wicks is the actual reason for the teams new success rather than cathy lees coaching too much tease and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment
