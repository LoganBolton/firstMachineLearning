i watched this movie when i was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as i had ever seenor ever was to see it may not have been a great movie my guess is it wasnt i dont really remember much about it to tell you the truth i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and biehn no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie i havent seen it since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i dont think id want to see it again since im sure it would be a disappointmentmy hormones arent as raging and ive become more jaded over the years still when i think back on the shower scene i can still remember how great it felt way back whenbr br added later after watching the movie again i discovered that its dangerous to go home again what was once erotic is now pretty tame the older womanyounger man thing still works for me just not as much as it once did probably because im no longer a 12yearold that older woman is now younger than i am also the amateurishness of the whole thing wasnt perceived by my twelveyearold mind br br moral sometimes its better not to revisit the past
