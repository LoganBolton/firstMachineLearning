this one acts as a satire during the womens rights movement era of course that doesnt mean coach the movie is a wonderful experience to behold it runs into the same vein as fastbreak which was better but still tame and is basically standard fare fluff what i mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste its the same feeling you may get after watching this a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a mans duty but i expected better things
