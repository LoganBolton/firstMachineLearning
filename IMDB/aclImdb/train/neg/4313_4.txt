like last year i didnt manage to sit through the whole thing okay so chris rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging or rather out of all the total bores packed into the theatre he at least wasnt in the top 10 most boring a lot of the presenters on the other hand were in this coveted top 10 i hadnt known that the whole thing had been done by autocue although i knew it was scripted but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression look away from the cue and stumble over simple words natalie portmanÂ…if theres no director shes gone the night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious beyonce knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips adam sandler wins the worst presenter awardbr br for helping me write this review id like to thank my mum my dad my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me and id like to point out that i have a high metabolism and of course i havent been starving myself for a month im not going to crythank you
