seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winnersbr br although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring i think its seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new its pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more hip and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p diddy and prince present a category also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to renew the ceremony and make it more appealing none of it really worked outbr br sure chris rock is a funny guy but he wasnt really a good presenter i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories his presence wasnt really as big as for instance billy crystalsbr br also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weirdbr br still i cant remember being any more satisfied with the award winners none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants i dont think so i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now with the exception of million dollar baby and the passion of the christ maybe sure i dont agree with every single award that was handed out this year for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography not that i dont like robert richardsons work he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stones work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music but oh well there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course i understand that there will always be people complaining about the winnersbr br it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners did prince said any of the nominees names right at once and were is sean penns sense of humor al pacino and jeremy i hope they missed irons were the best presenters of the nightbr br overall a very forgettable show but with nice winnersbr br 410
