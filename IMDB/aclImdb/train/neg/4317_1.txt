my spouse  i found this movie to be very schlocky it started out good but quickly got unbelievable  ridiculous most of the acting was poor with the exception of the little girl abbie who really was terrific in addition the dialog was predictable  lame  especially gideon the angels also without giving away anything when one of the characters has a tragedy she almost appears nonchalant at first we thought it was shock but then we realized that it was just a terrible script we love almost all of the hallmark movies  their heartwarming stories but this movie doesnt rise to the occasion of being one there are so many great ones  dont waste your time with this horrible movie
