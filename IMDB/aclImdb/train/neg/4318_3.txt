i thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies i have ever seenthe others being the christmas wife and jack frost all three movies are about death if you like being thoroughly depressed then by all means watch this film or any of the others in this film the acting is good and some of the scenery apart when people are dying is lovely but i am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in despite a happily ever after ending the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another and for some crazy reason i dont want to be depressed when i watch a christmas movie i know this sounds crazy folksafter all isnt bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anywaybr br for a more uplifting viewing experience try the forgotten house without a christmas tree george c scotts christmas carol or a christmas story insteadunless of course you like being miserable
