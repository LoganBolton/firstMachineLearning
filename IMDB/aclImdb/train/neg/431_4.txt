admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which id heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked aheadofitstime intelligent and engaging citypolitical thriller its notbr br city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power twofaced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really doesntbr br unfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and were left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spiderweb of lies and coverups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i dont think were left with that in city hall and while its a very full film i dont find it altogether rich
