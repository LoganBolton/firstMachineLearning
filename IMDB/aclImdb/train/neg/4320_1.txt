first of all let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays this movie is cold brutal and just downright depressing mary steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job they are losing their house cant buy christmas presents for the kids etc you get the idea happy stuff for the holidays so along comes harry dean stanton as gideon the christmas angel who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them what better way to instill the spirit of christmas in mary steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam the movie lays everything on so thick that you dont care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable im sure this film wanted to be something capralike but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be
