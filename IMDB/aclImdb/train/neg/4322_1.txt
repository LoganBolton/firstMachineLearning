read on and take note  you could save 88 minutes of your life was that allbr br unremittingly bleak this film sets out to produce im guessing a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style if failscompletely and absolutely fails ive been trying to think of one good thing about it and cant let me mention some of the highlights br br people dont die they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santas factory angels are actually excowboys who sit in trees santa can bring people back from the dead if you send him a nice letter br br and the plot i wont spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isnt any even the photography is bleak  snow shown at the end of a freeze everywhere looking cold damp and miserable br br as you might guess the film has a happy schmaltzy ending what a relief
