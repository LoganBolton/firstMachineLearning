european vacation aka national lampoons european vacation is the weakest of the vacation films the first and third one the most superior of the films while chevy chase and beverly dangelo return as clark and ellen griswold with new actors in the roles of russ and audrey griswold this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue this causes the pacing to suffer with the jokes not very funny at all to be more specific what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are are just pasted together into a cobbledtogether script rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 vacation films have oh well they cant win them all 4 out of 10
