john hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the 80s european vacation is not one of them the followup to hughes first big hit vacation 1983 is about as predictable unfunny and annoying as they come  no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic clark and ellen griswold chase and dangelobr br i greatly enjoyed vacation as well as the third film 1989s christmas vacation but the griswolds trip to europe is bland and forced perhaps because this was hughes first attempt at a sequel that he didnt get it but its really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story european vacation is there is no through story the griswolds win a game show for being greedy little pigs and go on a tour of europe through england france germany and italy even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming which is part director amy heckerlings fault the fast times at ridgemont high director sets everything up too predictablybr br maybe it was hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel european vacation takes great pride in insulting americans recall the greedy little pig game show they win especially tourists represented by the cornball griswold family it also pats itself on the back implicitly saying oh us griswolds were always getting into something because our dad is an idiot then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to america and how grateful the griswolds are to return to such a better country if hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie well maybe i should award this 810 starsbr br its not just the unfunniness but european vacation boasts the two worst actors to play kids rusty and audrey jason lively and dana hill theyre both annoying and obnoxious with the unattractive and loudmouthed audrey blubbering about the boyfriend shes left behind nearly the entire film hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst quite tasteful speaking of breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason unless it was to comment on americans love of gratuitous nipples in their comediesbr br i will give the film one of its two stars thanks to eric idle of the monty python crew whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from holy grail is about the funniest part if hughes intended for us to find one of the films only non american actors as the only funny part then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of hollywood comedy in the 80s still would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining
