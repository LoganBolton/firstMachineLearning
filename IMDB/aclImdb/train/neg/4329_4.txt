i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie the lines pacing and timing of events in that film are outstanding however this european vacation sequel is a major let downbr br in this sequel the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild haha laughs for example a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark do you want your coke in the can clark answers back no ill have it right here thats really about the only line that is funny in this filmbr br european vacations humor is strained as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie tried to rehash a script that had been done before and relied on a ridiculous slapstick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill timebr br worse the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found their replacements are not funny cant act and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny they are in bad tastebr br the griswalds should have stayed in wally world the place that made them legends dont join them on this european dreadful adventure viewers should rewatch the original vacation movie in place of this youll be glad you did
