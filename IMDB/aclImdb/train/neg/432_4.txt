this movie had the potential to be far more than it was but it not only fails to deliver it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same timebr br john cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent which he noticeably loses several times each scenebr br al pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck hes good as usual but hardly standoutbr br supporting cast  throw in female romantic interest which added little if anything to the story speaking of the story a convoluted who really cares tale where cusack is the selfrighteous mayors boy who just has to search for the right thing to be donebr br people dont act this way cusacks character loses all credibility at the end of which without revealing it is preach and nauseous the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound its also completely inaccurate but i wont get into lawbr br this is a bad by the numbers movie it seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then its really a preachy proselytizing selfrighteous film for the last hour better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk
