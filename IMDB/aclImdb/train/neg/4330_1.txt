last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlitos way  carlitos way rise to power 2005 which went straight to dvdno wonder it completely and i mean completely sks  waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it i dont understand how de palma agreed on producing this shtfest of a movieexcept for only one fact that i tip my hat to jay hernandez who plays the young brigante reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it  jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino too bad for him i dont think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this shty movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth
