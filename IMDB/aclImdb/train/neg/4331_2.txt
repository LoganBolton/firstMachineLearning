soon after watching this film you will realize why it didnt even make it to the theaters this movie does not deserve the prequel tag instead this is a common theme in hollywood rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels sequels etcbr br this films plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball and the character development was nonexistent i seriously felt like i was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad p diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting he actually made me laugh every timebr br the only good thing that comes out of this movie is jaclyn desantis who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this filmbr br if you are a big carlitos way fan i recommend you not watch this if you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original because that is exactly what it did
