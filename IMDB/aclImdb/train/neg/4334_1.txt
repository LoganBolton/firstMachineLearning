this movie had potential and i was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious  its hard to swallow being treated like such an idiotbr br rise to power is set in the late sixties carlitos way is set in the mid to late seventies for this movie to be realistic it would have to be set in the fifties if not the late fortiesbr br rise to power has no sign of gail pennelope ann miller no sign of kleinfeld no sign of rolando that carlito supposedly ran with in his heyday none of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie were supposed to believe that carlito met all these people in the span of a few yearsbr br rise to power ends with carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film also the prequel creates the rocco and earl characters  whats supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in carlitos way its also hard to understand how carlito could have the relationship with the italians he has in the original film watching the events of rise to power where are the taglialuccis in this film there is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison its like trying to put a square plug into a round holebr br it is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called carlito brigante into the story the film had some good moments but i think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to carlitos waybr br if you feel determined to see this movie the only advice i can give is to not think of the movie as a linear prequel think of it like the spaghetti westerns with clint eastwoods man with no name in other words two movies that have the same character but arent necessarily connected with each other
