really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlitos ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higherbr br its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90s overall it was approximately Â£6 and 2 hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltios way fans avoid this fiasco
