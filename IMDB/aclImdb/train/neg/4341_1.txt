this was so lame that i turned the dvd offmaybe halfway through it was so weak i couldnt even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in i made itthough i really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young carlito would be somewhat different i just couldnt buy it i dont really blame the actors because i think it was the script that may have fallen flat i did find myself laughing a few times but i dont think those lines were intended to be funnybr br its only saving grace is that i bought it in a 2 dvd set and i would have paid the price i did for the original alone this is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone
