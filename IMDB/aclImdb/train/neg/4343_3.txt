im a big fan of pacino movies hes one of if not the best actors of this genre however this movie couldve been a whole lot better even though it had a poor cast all they had to do was tell the story of carlito brigante up until he went to jail instead it seemed like this was just one of many stories that could be told of carlito all or even some of the questions about his past that we wondered about in the original couldve been answered as far as im concerned thats the only way you can make this movie instead we get this prequel that has almost none of the original characters in it a character that plays a different part from the original horrible move and a totally different love interest for carlito dont even get me started with puffy no way can i take that cat seriously as a gangsta after watching him dance in all his artists videos evertytime that dude opened his mouth i was waiting for him to start dancing he made me laugh if anything mario van peeples surprised me with his role i thought he was gonna give a lackluster performance due to his recent history he did rather well he was probably the most believable out of the entire cast in my opinion jay hernandez did his best but doesnt have the skills right now in his career to take on this role i appreciated his energy and his efforts though hard to follow up pacino the only way you could even have a clue about what kind of person carlito was is to watch the original otherwise carlito looks like a cold blooded killer in one scene then a spineless wimp in another he was one of the baddest gangstas of his time but you would only see flashes of that in this movie maybe this is a pitiful way for hollywood to try and make a 2nd prequel to cash in on this failure wouldnt surprise mebr br overall in my opinion this movie fell well short or what it couldve been the only reason i gave it a 3 was because i laughed a lot and mario van peeples earned some respect back with me a serious director shouldve taken this movie and actually put time into the story and turned it into an actual prequel im extremely disappointed that this movie wasnt taken seriously they wouldve been better off making this into a miniseries on hbo and actually telling the story like the original suggests at the end of the movie they had the nerve to suggest that carlito would have to come back to the city heeellllothats the part everyone wants to see then again this is all just my opinion i cant tell you how to waste your money
