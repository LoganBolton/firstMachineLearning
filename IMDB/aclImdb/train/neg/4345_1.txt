deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and carlitos way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was editing room assistant for scarface not to take away from bergmans talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly lied to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think puff daddy did a good job although luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlitos way its obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film
