why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago i can say that there is little if anything from the original book i went into this film with low expectations  i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it  but it even failed to meet thesebr br this is not a prequel  the only relationship it has with the original is the name this is not the story of carlito brigante it is the story of a totally different character whos been given the same name they have just totally spat in the face of every carlitos way fan out there adding insult to injury by casting luis guzman who plays a crucial character in the original movie in a different rolebr br whats most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original untouched material of the book carlitos way  something i really would have liked to have seen i felt the same way about chopper  they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic nonfictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of australias most feared underworld figure instead they made a hohum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook though eric banas performance was spoton now we will never get to see carlitos real initial rise and fallbr br the three stars is because looking at it purely as a standalone flick it is not so appalling  there are some decent performances jay hernandez is no carlito but he could be good in other roles and the story is not too bad even puffy combs suits his role but they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time i am a bit of a crimenonfiction buff something which the original film and the books got right having been written by then attorney and now judge edwin torresbr br the fact is though its not a stand alone  its perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed
