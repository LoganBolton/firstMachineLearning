already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally fallaciousbr br when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter  its time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton i know not too difficult zizeks mouth spews just as much baloney as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert bllsosopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories to rant without a beginning or end and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the superego im kind of surprised he didnt play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell its like the premise of schumachers the number 23 play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess dis deathbr br however there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoos nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours its like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasionsbr br i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate moviemaking into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence dont require a shrinkturnedphilosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these daysbr br when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leighs blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leighs vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldnt have been the illogical farfetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizeks fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated  ie the easily impressionable and the gulliblebr br zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkinss cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done dont laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done  the cleaning of a bloodstained toilet  while they were conceivingdirecting that scene talk about putting words into ones dead mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to saybr br i like zizeks initial thoughts on tarkovskys terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in antifeminism and other nonsense into his theorybr br zizeks attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped  at least not publicly  by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof commonsense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the endgoal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsdtripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001sbr br the fact that zizek overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors  and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything  such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didnt feature more prominently thats another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynchs incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched itbr br zizeks comment that the viewer readily accepts von triers laughable groundbreaking physical setup in dogville made me snicker br br however zizek doesnt only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious like all social scientists an oxymoron he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact its what we already all know but told in an eloquent way  which fools the more unobservant listenerbr br i was halfexpecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a looniesuitbr br slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kids park near youbr br
