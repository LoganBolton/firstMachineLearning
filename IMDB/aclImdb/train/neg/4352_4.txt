if you have seen friends the writing will feel very familiar especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy setupsbr br the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young about 10 years old i think now theyre in their midtwenties and they meet again on a class reunion this is where the series startsbr br a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once theyre usually not connected in any way each story line is cut up into multiple sections which are then shown in a mixed orderbr br the sketches is where my problems lie with this series as in the later seasons of friends its often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations one of the main characters does something really stupid thats hard to believe the situation is then heavily exaggerated as if it wasnt silly enough if youre into this kind of inyourface humor then maybe youll like this series for me it is a great turnoffbr br the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons there are interesting and especially credible story lines with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters the class has none of this the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far its therefore not possible to relate to them and like thembr br at least with friends it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out but in the class it seems it has run out of steam before it even started
