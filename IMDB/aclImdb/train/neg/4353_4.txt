the class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27yearold former class matesbr br i like the idea of the show thats why it saddens me that the class is not funny even though it has the obvious potential its not enough corky just dorky haha this is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines also some actors have difficulties with timingbr br most inventively written characters are the twins kat and lina warbler lizzy caplan and heather goldenhersh but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show on the other hand the characters i find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the usedtobe couple duncan and nicolebr br what bothers me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent even though by a nonrespectable character but anyway
