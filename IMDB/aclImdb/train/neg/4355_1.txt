horrible i see many user comments on how great this show is it truly is a wannabefriends  made in taiwan knockoff the jokes are lame asand the plot is ridiculous the actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines if you can call them that the bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet or at least another continent there are obviously reasons that tv companies cancel showsand none of then are when shows are doing well make sense anyway steer clear  even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to dogo stand in the rain instead  more fun
