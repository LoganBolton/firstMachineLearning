a group of friends come facetoface with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful german countrysidebr br the mutant cannibal family concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress with barricade timo rose tries to give the wellworn routine a teutonic twist by transplanting the action to the black forest and giving it the german lowbudget splatter treatment the result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsÂ—in particular the nonstop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniquesbr br had timo rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him then barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gorefest his inexperienced cast do reasonably well the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments all of this however is completely ruined by the awful camerawork choppy editing and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with todays filmmakersbr br i give barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements and some pretty decent shotgun damage
