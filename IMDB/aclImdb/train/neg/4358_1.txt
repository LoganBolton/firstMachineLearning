well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that ill never get back on this piece of trash i heard someone online describe this movies villains as subhuman cannibals and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent wrong the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch this movie isnt so controversial ive seen this level of gore in many films this movie plain sucks synopsis a blonde who thinks shes real hot but she isnt her admirer and her admirers friend no i dont remember their names go into the woods their car breaks down they are warned to leave by a man named mark the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they cant find the admirers friend admirer impales his foot whoops dont worry he is much more upset when his car wont start than when he gets impaled by nails after a nanosecond of coaxing the blond leaves to find help events ensue that i cannot remember during this and throughout the movie we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals even though all they are seen eating is intestines which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard unsuccessfully to work up tears then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can out think them mark the man who warned them to leave has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family then there is some shooting they leave the house the shooting continues then a random guy shows up and says hes been watching them before he is shot we are shown an acidtrip inspired scene of more killing the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them theres more killing the admirer professes his love for the blonde then a mysterious hand covers the camera what does that imply i dont know hopefully not a sequel
