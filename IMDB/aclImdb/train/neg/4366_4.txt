way back when the xfiles was an intelligent thoughtprovoking show a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas tying the plot to the spooky side of real lifebr br i was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on one son and requiem and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were farfetched implausible or downright silly but i figured hey give it the benefit of a doubt maybe theyre bringing it back because theyve got some great ideas lined upbr br roadrunners really was upsetting following patience which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid the episode sees a strange alien parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods christians oh and they think its the second coming of christ but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes seriously theres never any attempt to make sense of this to explain what the slug is why anything thats happening is happening or anything even in the shows early years  in fact especially then  you could expect a little bit more depth a bit of background or if not that then the opposite  a bit of mystery some uncertainty about what this was all about br br its scully that really kills it though you could put up with the silliness of the premise but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch you feel like youre watching some godawful teen horror except that its a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that shes spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety oh and by the way doggett the new mudler isnt around scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him he shows up at the end to save the day  i cant even remember why  but apart from that hes not really in it again seriouslybr br in short it feels like either a generic script written for another show or someones pet movie project which theyve been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing longrunning show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable it mightve worked on a lesser show where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less but the xfiles had a good thing going and scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic tv characters of the 90s deciding that youre going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they mustve done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless
