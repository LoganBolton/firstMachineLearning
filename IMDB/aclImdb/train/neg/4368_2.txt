this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha and its for diehard boris karloff fans like moi only its not a horror flick but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy womans husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing all hell breaks loosebr br its appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious especially from the leading lady mona goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the doublecrossed wifebr br but proceed with much caution
