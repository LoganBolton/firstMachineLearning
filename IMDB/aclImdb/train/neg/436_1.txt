if youve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says jesus is the answer whats the question then perhaps you should thank god if youve never met a lacanian slavoj zizek the most evangelical of lacanians would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for lacanhegelbr br zizeks star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption so it seems impressive when someone  anyone  comes along and says hang on films may say something about ourselvesbr br the ideas zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so for example zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego superego and id god knows what happened to zeppo or gummo  perhaps theyre the sinthomeor is that movies themselves this is simply what they are in zizeks output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology people may object that he certainly has something to say  but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to gods willbr br whats wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory well nothing at all as zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof however it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context without context you can say and prove anything you want for zizek lacan is the answer  so he goes and makes an example of it everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology for instance zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop but in the context of the film this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all stewart has been deliberately led there by novak this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermonbr br his analysis of the baby wants to f scene in blue velvet is laughable touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance zizek says that isabella rossilinis character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation this is an example of her jouissance well  possibly but  sorry to be prosaic  where is the evidence for this in the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan but this may be due to any number of things isnt that the point of socalled feminine jouissance according to lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language if this is right then no example can be made of it it also means that the entire concept is nonsensical and entirely mystical it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek theres feminine jouissance for you why is this feminine jouissance because i say so br br what example can really be garnered from these films only zizeks psychology why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on botega bay he says he wants to f rod steiger too is this not the wishfulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films as the saying goes freud would have a field day with the perverts guide to the cinema  but with zizek himself nobody elsebr br zizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely  as to be almost useless  how the rest of us desire for as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated  and cannot be easily universalised if at all zizeks love of making everything an example of lacans answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how i do it problem is in zizeks desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire but zizek is a leninist and they certainly dont like letting the subject speak for itselfbr br the perverts guide to the cinema is a summation zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isnt zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into questionbr br zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing hes a kind of henry ford of cultural theory massproduction and any colour as long as its black he is perfect for todays highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same cap over and over and pretending that it is something different this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems  which capitalism always claims to provide  rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all which is kind of like being brain dead for me zizeks third matrix pill is a suicide capsulebr br ps i loved zizeks solemn remark  presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity  that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws
