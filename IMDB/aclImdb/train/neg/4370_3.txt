this movie is all ultralightweight fluff predictable from beginning to end as a don knotts vehicle the incredible mr limpet was much better with knotts character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant his performance there was toned down with none of his trademark goggleeyed stare although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile much as bob denver did neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles assuming they were simply typecast it was probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the highpitched voice john ritter whom knotts worked with in threes company was able to transcend his genre branching out successfully into dramatic roles like the dreamer of oz but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in pleasantville even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in airplane and police squadbr br theres also no way the then43 yearold knotts could pass for a 35 yearold as his character insisted he was it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at 38 playing the collegeage forrest gumpbr br the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget very much looking like a hastilyfilmed tv episode its especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where roy goes after hes fired its unlikely even a preschooler would be fooled by the mayberrylike soundstage artificialitybr br even viewing this strictly as a childrens movie its very disappointing its not because it lacks action or special effects although it does the pace is much too slow the situations repetitive how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap with breakneck gags otherwise you risk boring them and any adults in the theater as well movies even kids movies have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written disneys the love bug for instance at least had some interesting race action
