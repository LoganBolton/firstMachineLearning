i love don knotts let me just say that upfront he is an enormous talent and the best at what he does which is portray a nervous lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority he is fabulous in this role as roy fleming the reluctant astronaut but the film is pretty dull really even though as a kid my brother and i delighted in watching this and his other films its still worth watching but really its a film that is best enjoyed by children id categorize it as 100 familyfriendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family nightbr br as with all of knotts films theres a great cast of beloved character actors and you cant help but smile when knotts gives one of his shaky openmouthed stares no matter how old and jaded you arebr br from an adult perspective one thing i think that is great about this film is how it captures nasa in the 1960s  all the new modern buildings the hope the optimism the future and i was surprised at how suave and studly leslie neilsen was back then only complaint about the story is roys love interest a rather threadbare unlikeable woman who cant give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot  if youre like me youll be hoping that he gives her the shoveoff at the end beware  youll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching its that catchy
