given the title and outlandish box art i was ready for just about anything perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high because i was left a little drybr br a film crew working on a softcore sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex where hasnt this set up been used before the difference here is the uberperverse nature of the sex not allowed to show all the goods groin shots were illegal in japan for a long time what is shown is fogged out the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can bebr br amidst all the kinky goings on a mud monster whose origin i cant fathom shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the womenthen murdering them too some of the sights are a bit much most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful ofstuff but otherwise the gore is pretty standard farebr br ultimately the film is pulled down by its own designs its too oversexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick the mediums can work but there need to be a balancebr br 410
