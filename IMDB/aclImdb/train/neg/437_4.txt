spoilersbr br i was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i feltbr br the idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two thingsbr br first of all the film was so downtoearth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a daytoday basis it became itself ordinary and dullbr br secondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandablebr br too bad
