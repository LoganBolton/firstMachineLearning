cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that ive ever seenbr br not that they didnt try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting im not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrongbr br some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing i had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran there was also an insincerity about it all being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it that was bolstered by the pretty 17 yearold girl who was in love with the 30 yearold junkiebr br and the frantic nature of the lead was a turnoff enough there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was listless and unending with uneven time lines the characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who youve just not seen enoughbr br skip it i assumed that this was a firsttime director who was enamored by his own turds but he has done this before im puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money
