satans little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen when i say better i mean the story the film hatches a new plot something thats not so clich√© in the horror genre  something fresh but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it questions you will be asking yourself throughout the moviebr br the film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv i was tired of all the so called terrifiying hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different the cover art for satans little helper immediately caught my attention as you can see the image draws you in  its chilling i knew it was a straight to dvd release  but i took a chance i mean i just seen boogey man the night before  so it couldnt get any worse after i watched the movie i was semisatisfied i loved the plot of the movie it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend so he could kill in some sick deranged way he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners  a duo of terror it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night this way no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid they would simply think he was his guardian but this is also where the plot holes begin to surfacebr br if your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating  thats fine you wouldnt think anything of it  if he was 9 or round about the same age as him if however he appeared with a strange man in a mask you would be startled and protective of your child you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself you would ask why he is with your son he doesnt know him you would tell him to please leave he isnt a family friend hes a stranger now were supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers in this case the mum is completely fine with it huh they never seem to think its a tad odd that the man doesnt speak  at all gruanted they think its the daughters boyfriend but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why hes not saying a wordbr br the film goes down hill from there the thing that got me the most was all the mum said was do you want some cider i cant count how many times she says this in the movie its like oh youre dying  we have cider though its all good the movie started promising and failed to deliver it was more of a horrorcomedy and even as that it fails to deliver i guess you could call it a dudflop etcbr br the best thing about the movie is the cover art though something tells me thats not worth the 12 dollars
