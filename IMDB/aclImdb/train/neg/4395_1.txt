december holiday specials like the original frosty ought to be richlyproduced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feelwell special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtextbr br so when i saw legend of frosty the snowman in the tv listings i got my kids 6 and 8 pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original frosty and passionately relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed  i guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this moviebr br unfortunately legend of frosty the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worsethannormal episode of sponge bob than a classic holiday movie dont get me wrongthose shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or sponge bob my low expectations for mediocre offcolor zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfiedbr br we picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of frosty the snowman
