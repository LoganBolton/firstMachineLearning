usually i love lesbian movies even when they are not very good im biased i guess br br but this one is just the pits yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time annamarie alternates between sulking and getting highstonedpassing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie at no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why annamarie is so depressed and withdrawnbr br if there had at least been some kind of closure in the potentially romantic we dont even know relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction but although annamarie at one point asks ella why do you love me ella doesnt even acknowledge this its never really clear whether this is anything more than an illbehaved lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight womanbr br even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensiblebr br there is one good joke in the movie although im sure it was unintentional the women travel in a twoseat ford coupe with a middling sized trunk yet when they set up camp they have an enormous tent cots sleeping gear and even a table chair and typewriter on top of that when they board a ferry we see piles of luggage presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little fords trunk br br and through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert so where did they get fuelbr br there may not be too many lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse leave this one in the rack
