the basic premise of miami golem most definitely deserves a spot in the top say fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down i know top 50 doesnt sound too impressive but ive seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots i was prepared from something convoluted because the film was directed and cowritten by alberto de martino who was one of italys most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers de martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters like most italian directors did around that time but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex confusing and overwhelming not all of de martinos films are worthwhile but some of them are extremely underrated like a special magnum for tony saitta holocaust 2000 and formula for a murder the concept of miami golem contains elements from numerous great scifi and adventure flicks like alien starman  close encounters of the third kind et Â… but i wouldnt exactly call it a ripoff the only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening synthesizer theme song that sounds almost identical to harold faltermeyers axel f from beverly hills cop the rest of the film is an amusing hodgepodge of fantasy scifi action horror and superheromovie gimmicks it certainly doesnt always make sense most of the time it doesnt actually but miami golem is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and i fascinated from start to finishbr br the plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but ill try anyway sceptical journalist craig milford is reporting the story of a german scientist who allegedly discovered extraterrestrial dna inside a crashed meteorite and managed to clone it the dna cell belongs to an evil alien force that already exterminated another interstellar race in the past and it will unquestionably destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size if this isnt problematic enough already the rich mr anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil fetus because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world domination with the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise craig milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus okay i know all this sounds grotesque and silly but i assure that miami golem is in fact a lightheaded and easy digestible flick the first half of the film may come across as overly hectic and confusing because alberto de martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings there are subliminal ghostly appearances supportive characters behaving exaggeratedly mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even speculations about the lost continent of atlantis this is all misleading padding material however and as soon as the setup is more or less clear miami golem turns into an ordinary early 80s popcorn action movie with bloody massacres flamboyant chase sequences in the florida everglades explosions gratuitous sleaze and nasty little fetusmonsters in jarsbr br now i really dont want to raise the impression that miami golem is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema make no mistake this is a pretty bad movie the events only become endurable if you accept the stupidity and incoherence of the plot and if you dont succeed in that well than this is just a nonstop spitfire of negative aspects the acting performances are painfully awful particularly bmovie veteran john ireland as the archetypal james bond villainous character doesnt seem the least interested in the script you can tell from his grimaces and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck laura trotter is probably the least sexy female lustobject ever and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic vhs cover must have felt exactly the same way because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie what an embarrassment this must be for mrs trotter still her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this as shes quite hot from the neck down and finally theres the unforgettable scene where david warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol i dont think even john rambo can do this while hes a beefcake vietnam veteran and warbecks character is a simple tvreporter
