i have always said that some plays by their very nature just cant be translated to film and this one is a prime examplebr br as a play this is a very funny farcical satire of the catholic church with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not sinned since his last confession so she feels she is sending him straight to heavenbr br thats just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes and in the make believe world of the theater it works however that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film and it certainly doesnt herebr br director marshall brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomachbr br seek out a production of the stage play instead you wont be disappointed
