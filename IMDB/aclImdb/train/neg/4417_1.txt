i am a catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns taught by jesuit priests in high school  college i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a good catholic in the churchs eyes because i dont believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me tobr br so back to the movieits bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be goodbr br at first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister marys emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedythe tragedy of loss of life besides the two former studentsthe lives of the aborted babies the life of the students mom the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god this is what is wrong with todays islam and yesterdays judaism and christianity
