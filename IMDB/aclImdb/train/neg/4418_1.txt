this is a film that takes some digesting on the one hand we are offered a tough outward shell a story that does not only derive the catholic church but does so foolishly and uninformed on an inner layer we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understandbr br at first glance it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy if so then mr durang needs to open a dictionary because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word the jokes are pale the humor is awkward and poorly delivered in particular ms keatons performance is flighty and over the top well below the quality of her annie hall and sleeper days jennifer tilly is again the model of stridence with her hipitched voice and whining style all of this could be forgiven if it werent for the last 20 minutes of this movie that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981br br careful spoilers aheadbr br it all starts with the appearance of four former students of sister mary ignatius ignatius by the way is a male name and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with when they all admit that they dont live up to the churchs teachings the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny alltooclich√© sepiatone flashbacks when one of them admits to having two abortions the nun becomes even more abusive until the pupil pulls out a gun after wrestling it away from her the nun kills the pupil presumably in selfdefense she then goes on a screaming rampage killing a gay former student because of his sins the last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a christlike pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her can you say heavy handed i knew you couldbr br i know there have been abusive nuns in the past and i know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie i have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously no pun intended this explanation is hard to swallow though simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another this film is simply anticatholic tripe which in the name of fairness and equality is mean spirited and hatefulbr br this is a film i would recommend for a catholic namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today if it were rabbi ray explains it all or imam muhammad explains it all there would be rioting in the streets and showtime would lose all of its subscription but sadly because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of viewbr br i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic so it wasnt just ignorance that brought them to make this filmbr br i give it 15 stars out of 5 not because of its offensive nature but because it was poorly written poorly directed and just a bad movie in general dont even waste your time
