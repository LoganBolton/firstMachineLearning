as a lapsed catholic who had 11 years of catholic school but hasnt been to mass in 35 years except for weddings and funerals i thought id get a kick out of this and i did    for the first twothirds of the movie it was all the standard stuff  strict parochial school teachings repressed sexuality etc but then suddenly the movie turned mean really mean now mind you i saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit    and maybe i wouldnt have been quite so offended at such nasty hateful digs at the catholic church if id known about those abominations such a catholic term and coverupsbr br its been a few years since i rented the video and i wont go back to rent it again with a new perspective it just left such a dirty nasty ugly taste in my mouth    i wonder what experience all the actors had with the church because either they really hate it or they whored themselves for the paycheck its an incredibly anticatholic movie offensive to anyone who has a glimmer of a gleam of respect for catholic education which i still do because there were no better teachers back in the 50s whatever else those nuns did they forced me to learn how to read and write the english language they made us memorize how many kids today can do simple arithmetic in their heads truth is theres nothing more essential for success in america can ya read can ya addsubtractmultiplydivide great you can get any advanced degree you want and the discipline of catholic education will stand you in good stead not just as you continue your studies but also for the rest of your life no matter what you think of the catholic mythology we all had to learnbr br such a great cast such a lousy rotten script i really feel bad and no its not badly  trust me the nuns taught me better for the writer and directorbr br i thought i had mixed emotions about catholic school but the participants in this project mustve been those bad iee stupid kids who sat in the back of the room if they were willingly involved in making this movie
