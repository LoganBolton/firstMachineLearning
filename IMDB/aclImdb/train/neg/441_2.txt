we dont have this on television in england but i walked it over the internet on youtube its dumb immature and boring this is from the creator of earthworm jim douglas tennapel i never got into that cartoon but i must admit it better than this the cartoonist hasnt done anything for years since now for doug tennapel this is a comeback travesty and an all time low the story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master they are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on boring the animation is dreadful the main characters are meant to be cats right but they dont look nothing like cats just weird animal monsterlooking creatures with big mouths pointed teeth and bulgy eyes the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly the theme song is terrible and irritating also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows it surprised me how this show got 7510 votes of other imdb viewers television really isnt what is used to be but now most of them is dumb cheaply made and boring some of you on the website might not agree with me well im sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain dont have too tolerate this crap oh yeah if you have digital you have to but i dont so it not my problem loser 210 and its very lucky to get that because ive given other shows worst
