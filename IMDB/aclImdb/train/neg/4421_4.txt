the subject is certainly compelling a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors kings princes and castles wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to escape from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence  something almost everyone can relate to the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings nerds and star trek enthusiasts thats enough to get most people to watch however very quickly the film turns into an insiders view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who dont get it the filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming and this particular one waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords its pretty hard for anyone who doesnt sit on their computer for 710 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care however the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand moreover the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them a big nono when youre trying to keep peoples attention for 90 minutes
