uh oh another gay film this time its showing the black side bet your last dollar its gonna have an unhappy ending but why with only less than a half dozen exceptions all gay films have to end in death or an addio finale its like all the european film noir releases in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s the leadmale or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion why in gods name must writers directors and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed after all its supposed to be gaynot glum maybe the category should be changed to a glum film a large percentage of gay relationships do last and the couples do ride off together into the sunset no matter who writes or produces he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle this movie just proves my point if you rent the dvd take an antidepressant for here comes another gay film this is wrong
