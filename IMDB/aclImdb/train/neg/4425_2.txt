a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young gay black artistbr br if that sounds vague its because the movie itself is its welldirected fairly wellwritten and for the most part wellacted also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black  white also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes not that explicit and no frontal still i mostly hated thisbr br the film meanders all over the place is full of unlikable characters including the main protagonist and this is the killer moves at a snails pace three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored but the director was there so i stayed br br his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete i really wish i could like this more there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks but i cant unless youre very interested in the harlem renaissance theres no reason to see this
