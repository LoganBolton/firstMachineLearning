what a piece of stupid tripebr br i wont even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show its not worth the time the one comment i will make is  why get such a dumb inarticulate doofus to be the starbr br there arent many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe a decent series but will bring back braindead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american publicbr br fox has lost it imho
