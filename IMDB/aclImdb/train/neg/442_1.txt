this game was made by sega being made by sega i didnt expect much but i also didnt expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you dont move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though hes got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldnt even be worth renting
