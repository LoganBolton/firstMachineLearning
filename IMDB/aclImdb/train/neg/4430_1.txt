thanks to a dull dimensionless screenplay by neil simon and lackluster direction from robert moore chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty73 the goodbye girl77 audrey rose78 and only when i laugh81only this time she doesnt have a child to drag around chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simons the cheap detective78 and murder by death76 caan is miscast the characters are monodimensional the dialog is overly analytical and theres virtually no establishing detail the first half is a lessthancaptivating meet cute coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half the nyc locations as well as joe bologna and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant but at least they provide some welcome distraction and last and least theres an awful song played during the credits
