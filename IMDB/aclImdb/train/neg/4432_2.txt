tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite theres a bit of subtext that might be about frances colonial past but its mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers sadly that doesnt happen here it looks good and the acting is fine and theres nothing really wrong with the concept but its just so smug god does this movie love itself pity it isnt nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is the only impetus in the show  sorry movie  comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this thats right just like in a sitcom which is what this is with the added bonus of delusions of grandeur and a 110minute running time
