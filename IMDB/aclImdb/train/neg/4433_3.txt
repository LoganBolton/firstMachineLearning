i really wanted to like this movie a lot more than i did thats because i love wacky foreign comediesparticularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise however although this one frequently caught me by surprise these were almost never pleasant surprises it reminded me of south park in that nearly every social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny for example after exploring adultery drug abuse of nearly every sortranging from pot heroin speed to glue sniffing prostitution sm suicide murder etc the movie got to the hilarious topic of pedophilia mom encouraged her one son who looked about 12 yearsold to sleep with neighboring men in fact at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work funny youve got to be kidding this movie just goes too far and delves into the black hole of comedy what should they make fun of next cancer or rectal tumors
