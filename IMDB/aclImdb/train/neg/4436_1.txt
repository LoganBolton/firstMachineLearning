i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his waybr br mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply cant get over the fact that she is even in such a piecebr br stupid stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental
