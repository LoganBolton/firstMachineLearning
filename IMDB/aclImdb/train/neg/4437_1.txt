the triumph of love doesnt triumph over anything it is a plodding ponderous 4 hours of torture actually its a little less than 2 hours long it just seemed much longer it pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as ben kingsley and fiona shaw the supporting players are not quite as awful maybe they were trying to be so over the top so as to be clownish but if so i didnt see it that way mira sorvino doesnt make an impression one way or the other shehes just there my guess is the play of the same name written by marivaux some 270 or so years ago is much better it couldnt be any worse clare peploe the writer and director of this movie was inspired by a recent production of the play i dont know what she was thinking when she created this bomb br br maybe it all got lost in the translation
