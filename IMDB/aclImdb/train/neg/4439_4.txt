yikes this is pretty bad the play isnt great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours  especially as peploe doesnt decide how she wants to treat the materials theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that youre watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvinos central performance is breathtakingly poor stagey and plummy its as if shes playing the part via helena bonhamcarters merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note  and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material  but its hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaws ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana riggs daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertoluccis magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence
