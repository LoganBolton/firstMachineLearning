overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time  very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why  i have no idea must be the jewish theme
