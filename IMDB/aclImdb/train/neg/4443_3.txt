serum starts as eddie derek phillips is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an md like his father richard dennis oneill  his uncle eddie david h hickey however his joy could be short lived as eddie is involved in an accident  is run over by a car taken to the nearest hospital it doesnt look good for poor eddie so his uncle eddie convinces his brother richard to let him save eddie with the serum he has developed a serum which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness desperate for his boy to live richard agrees but the procedure has unwanted side effects like turning eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thingbr br executive produced written  directed by steve franke ill be perfectly frank myself  say serum is awful serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to ripoff other any number of others  ends up being slightly more fun than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers the script is terrible it has the whole reanimator 1985 feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge syringes trying to eradicate death but its so boring its untrue the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home after spending some time away  finding his exgirlfriend has hooked up with someone else arguments with his stepmom getting drunk with his mate  generally boring the audience stiff so once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over  if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get eddie reanimated  then he kills a couple of people police catch up with him  shoot him the end thank god serum is devoid of any of the characteristics that one would associate with a good film the characters suck the dialogue is poor it takes itself far too seriously its dull its slow its forgettable  considering its meant to be a horror film theres an alarming lack of blood gore or horror not recommended did i mention serum was boring i thought sobr br director franke does nothing to liven this thing up although competent theres no style here at all the gore levels are none existent theres a bit of splashed blood a bitten neck a couple of scars on a dead womans face a couple of scenes where a needle pierces skin  thats it dont expect a reanimator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed much like i was in fact filmed in what looks like one house one restaurant  a lab the film has no variety either  just looks cheap throughout theres a couple of scenes of nudity but thats nowhere near enough to save itbr br technically the film isnt too bad at least it looks like proper cameras were used i cant really comment on the special effects because there arent any but generally speaking serum looks reasonably professional apparently shot in texas or should that read it should have literally been shot in texas the acting sucks although again i think they were proper actors rather than friends or family of the directorbr br serum is a terrible film its dull slow boring has no gore  feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes i dont understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch reanimator or one of its sequels again instead seriously i recommend you give serum a miss there ive just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life you can thank me later
