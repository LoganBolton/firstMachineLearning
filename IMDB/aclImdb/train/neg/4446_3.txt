serum starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the reanimator movies and it owes a lot to them the story is very similar a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain sickness and death but hes apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a braineating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew the zombie even looks like one of those from reanimator and in fact some of the makeup effects in serum arent bad unfortunately the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 34 of the movie for some reason the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen i cant see why this was important other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing sometimes that wouldnt be present otherwise as the plot plods alongbr br there are a number of moments that just dont add up here for instance one victim is bludgeoned with a sledge hammer but when we see the victims head up close theres no sign of that trauma in another scene a character runs down a fully lit hospital corridor we can see the circles of light on the floor in fact with a flashlight in hand looking for all the world like hes walking in the dark but a moment later a second character walks down the same fullylit corridor without one these are just a couple of examples moments of what look like directorial or editorial sloppiness crop up quite frequently throughout the moviebr br serum is better in some ways than much of what goes straighttovideo as independent horror lately in terms of technical items  sound and photography for example  its got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a dvd on the other hand theres still a good deal of wooden acting particularly by one of the lead characters the mad scientist himself and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with though one of the problems with lowbudget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets and that almost never works out it didnt in the case of serum anyhow
