spoilers in thisbr br rosenstraße is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clichés and not enough good actingbr br the storytelling storyline is bad like in james cameron´s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now we´ve got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story tellinghow can riemann know about the fate of the little girl´s mother and her interrogation for examplebr br the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the twentiesbr br riemann´s character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a baroness wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not workbr br basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end it´s all very simple riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and  ta da  everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like sass it is vaguely based on a true eventbr br it is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad macaulay j connorbr br
