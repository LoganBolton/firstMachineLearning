julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but its hard to imagine shed end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it its nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about itbr br the plot has all the markings of a late night madeforcable and dont be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care br br ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without roberts name above the title im sure it would have totally flopped deservedly
