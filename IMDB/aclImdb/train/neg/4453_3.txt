im sure to people watching this move outside of britian this film will be an entertaining watch but for someone from the uk its painful in its errorsbr br right at the start of the film elijah wood gets off a tube at bank station which has been trashed he says to his sister who hes meeting what happened here and she replies oh tottenham were in town yesterday tottenham are in town already theyre part of the town they dont have to go there and if tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth theyd do it is bank station where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the worldbr br there are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan he clearly decided it wasnt worth trying to speak with an east end accent and instead opted for a dick van dyke style mockney which made my ears bleed it was accentuated by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way youd expect west ham fans to speak this error made him unbelievable in the role and really spoilt the film
