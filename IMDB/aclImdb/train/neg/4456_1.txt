this is possibly the worst film ive ever seen the fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough that theyve hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worsebr br i had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before i started watching but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce elijah woods character matt into the hooligan scenebr br but the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time beforebr br lets clear up a few things hooligans dont tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a runofthemill league game they dont set out to kill each other they dont only wear stone island and others in the crowd hooligans or not do they most certainly dont when having taken exception to a new firm member trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash and id love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firms top boy to the rival firm although you can scratch what i said about setting to out kill each other if one does existbr br dont get me wrongim yet to see a film on the subject that doesnt contain some fantasy whims but this is on a par with the firm for cluelessnessbr br i found it ironical that woods american nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user when this is part and parcel of the british hooligan scene the film chooses not to challenge woods morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using cokebr br i could go on but i think ive made my pointbr br as for the plot its highly unimaginative and im sure if i hadnt spent the entire film bemoaning the points and more made above then i would have guessed what was going on sooner than i did and believe me i was well in frontbr br i get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raisedbr br if im right then the makers have failed completely its too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene and i cant believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendenciesbr br are there any good points maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed but im rarely impressed by slowmo action certainly not when its a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anywaybr br there are some funny if unrealistic moments woods trip to school did raise a smile for me but a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated drossbr br if youre british avoid like the plague if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if youre not in the know if youre american you may enjoy it as its clearly tailored to the market but no one can deny the plot is flimsy predictable and ultimately over the top
