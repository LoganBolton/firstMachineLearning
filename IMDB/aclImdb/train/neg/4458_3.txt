most of the french films ive seen  and enjoyed  were more talk than action but thats okay i found them interesting wellphotographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that waybr br this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talkwhich is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching thisbr br actually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like thisbut i want a little more bang for a murder story
