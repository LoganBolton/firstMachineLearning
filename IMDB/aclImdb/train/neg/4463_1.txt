this is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back and then some like the time you spent accidentally picking it out the time you spent getting to the video store etcbr br first off the look its grainy its low budget now that in itself doesnt make for a bad film but the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural so thats kind of distractingbr br then the story 3 gals go on a gals weekend away from guys of course as everyone does when going on a camping trip they stop on the way to get earrings when they arrive at the area in which theyre going to stay they get pulled over by mr ranger sir who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season and then drives them where theyre going a remote cabin of course 2 cute guys wander into their vicinity and bambi yes bambi and aubry are immediately smitten but apparently bambi is smitten by anything with two legs mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting shfaced and stoned with her galpalsbr br oh and i almost forgot theres a mean old hermit that lives up that way thats perhaps someone to not tangle with and the area  cabin in which theyre staying have a sort of reputationbr br so of course sooner or later unfortunately much later some of our weekend woodvisitors begin to die and find various booby traps although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that and of course the remaining campers are understandably upset no cell phone reception of course who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore mr ranger sir keeps popping up at odd times  his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get helpbr br theres a fantastic twist to this that you just wont want to miss too if youre still awake pray that you wake up to a blank screenbr br the acting in this is terrible the production values are terrible and the whole undertaking is just lame  i find it amazing this was even released avoid at all costs 1 out of 10
