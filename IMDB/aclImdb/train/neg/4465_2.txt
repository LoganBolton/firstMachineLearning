after the overrated success of amenabar and balaguero spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies the result is all in films like el segundo nombre a tvlike production bad written but acted and directed even worse i didnt read the ramsey campbell book but im sure that the author of the doll who ate its mother didnt have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless youre searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater 210
