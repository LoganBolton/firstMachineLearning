br br im not sure who decides what category a movie fits into but this movie is not a horror movie as for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow i was especially disappointed with the ending thoughbr br spoilerbr br tell me why on earth does she run over to her uncles home without at least calling the detective or the police first she knows exactly whats going on at that point plus she has a video tape as proof instead she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying i know everything i have proof you didnt expect proof did you then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if hes going to harm her well duh of course hes going to harm you idiot you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything what a dumb ending
