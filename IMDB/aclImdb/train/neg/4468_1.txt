ok plain and simple if you are a fan of the other tomb raider games yes even aod keep away from legendbr br it is without doubt the most disappointing tr game yet it looks very nice it sounds very nice but it is totally unplayable and ive given up i feel like ive been robbed by eidosbr br its very simple tr was a pc game before anything else you control lara using the keyboard in 6 tomb raider games the controls were standard in aod they were tacky but still the same general control sequences in legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollablebr br i have seen comments elsewhere from people who say use the mouse no why should i others say use a gamepad no why should i others say but this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years well i dont care it is not the standard for any other tr game so why mess with it oh i know because they couldnt care less about their original loyal fan base they want to cash in on the new kids who hadnt even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money patheticbr br my advice to any serious tr fan is keep away from this game and if you do buy it complain to eidos i have seen masses of other posts mainly on the eidos forums from people telling them how rubbish it is perhaps they will listen
