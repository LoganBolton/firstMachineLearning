a smile like yours is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people who tried that hard mustve forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind tobr br lauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a dumb 50s romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interestbr br they are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really dont do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple dont do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so whatbr br the subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friends product the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scenebr br danny kinear is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i dont care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting br br the overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the main characters are completely boring they are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funnybr br joan cusak shouldve been in the lead and someone else shouldve taken kinnears part cusak wouldve made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her costarring role here this is definitely one to pass up
