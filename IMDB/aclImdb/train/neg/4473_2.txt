dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor to much calm down get yourself together and make us laugh i didnt quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars just because there both up on stage or something he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star im sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru i also liked the reeses pieces joke if dane just didnt act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating as high as maybe an eight
