i just saw this movie premiere on mtv i must say this was extremely mediocre at its best the dialogue doesnt explain the story very well and i was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes there isnt one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting i just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love also cate and heaths love seems very incestuous they seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers i dont understand why the father would accept something like that under his roofbr br i watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like i said its extremely hard to like any of the characters katherine heigls performance was horrid which was a complete shocker she was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of edward and there just wasnt enough lines for aimee osbourne for me even to critique her performance johnny whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person i sympathized with as for erika christensen and mike vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramaticbr br i just didnt enjoy this movie very much or the music in it there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band mxpx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again mtv did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not i just pictured something so completely different
