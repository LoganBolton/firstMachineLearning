let me start off by saying that i didnt watch this movie at first with high expectations it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies and mtv was pasted on the front cover so i was not expecting much what i was expecting was a tearjerker overly dramatic but at least effectivebr br i was wrongbr br firstly let me start off that i had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the moviebr br the acting was my main gripe with the film by god is it awful the main girl is pretty mediocre but when compared to the rest of the cast shes maryl streep the main hero heath is just plain awful he can sing decent sounding clich√©d songs but thats about it his acting broke the sad moments by being so bad at points that i just burst into laughter the isabel girl was pretty godawful too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldnt display emotion whatsoever and when he tried to it failed miserably neil patrick harris was the only decent actor playing edward although its obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what ive seen him do oh and the father wasnt halfbad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly rememberbr br the story itself was not very good more breakups than you can imagine predictable story until the ending which i barely understood extremely onesided characters with no real depth to them overall just not interesting or compelling nothing weve never seen before done much better and nothing worth watching herebr br the ending is suppose to be a tearjerker it did nothing of the sort the ending isnt built up at all it almost feels like an afterthought in fact i had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me i must have had a look on my face of wait when did they say that what never a good sign the editing was probably the worst ive seen though i do understand the fadeinsfadeouts are done because this was originally made for tv but thats really no excusebr br overall the movie is just garbage im a sensitive guy i cried during two episodes of the simpsons i never cried during this crap not even close really this movie is not worth your time if you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere
