i was skeptical when i first saw the calvin klineesque commercials but thought id give it a chance so ive watched it and all i can say is bleh this movie was so bad its rare that i hate a movie this much watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in altmans the player when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers id like to know which mtv producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of bronte but this time heathcliffs name is heath and hes a rock star and hindleys name is hendrix would be a good ideabr br even that might not have been so bad had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well the direction must have been youre lonely pout for me i laughed out loud during all the serious scenes and was bored throughout the rest the camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that i was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy my theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom  all i could hear in half the scenes were the waves and in the other scenes i wish thats all i could hear and speaking of sound what they did to the sisters of mercy song more is absolutely inexcusable then again its inexcusable what they did to brontebr br on the bright side there was one entertaining scene  specifically the moment when johnny whitworth licked katherine heigls face  and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you
