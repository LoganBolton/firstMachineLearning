ill admit that i liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequelbr br i was let down sure the special effects were technically amazing  but they werent believable looking it looked more like a cartoon alright i admit to liking 80 of the chase scene  but the fight with all the mr smiths it was too obviously animatedbr br i can accept all of that what i cant accept is that the nonaction parts were crap every time morpheus opened his mouth i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothingbr br i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie except about the existence of the matrix this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dreambr br ugh i want my 700 back
