as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie i was immediately excited the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldnt wait to see the second one especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies however when i saw it i left the theater extremely disappointed as did many other moviegoers at the theater with me while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them in the first movie there was constant fighting going on it seemed but the second took a much more and much unfortunate preachy point of view to sum up the plot there wasnt much to it that wasnt expected the machines were digging toward zion with intent of destroying it thats not a spoiler everyone saw it in the commercials the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous unless youre a psychology major you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie and because of that simply wont care it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and trinity agent smith for as badass as he was in the first movie seemed to get all religious and preachy personally i dont need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it the movie was a serious waste of my time and i dont think i can watch the first one anymore the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge and the ending of the movie shoved me right off what movie ends with to be concluded how original is that folks i wonder if the wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one in conclusion the movie was bad and thats the end of it
