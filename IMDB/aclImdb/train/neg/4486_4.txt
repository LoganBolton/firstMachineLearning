what the hell was all that about i saw the matrix and was amazed it was the most spectacular movie ever made what ever possesed the wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond mebr br there is no plot you cant argue with that basically all this film was was a load of talking and dont get me wrong i have no problem with talky films but all the talking in the matrix reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle then there would be a fight sequence which lasted way too long then more pointless drivvle then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anticlimax ever a little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutesbr br also keanu reeves gives his worst performance yet i knew he wasnt a good actor but this was beyond a joke if you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along god knows what his performance is like in somethings gotta give keanu reeves the only plank of wood ever to become an actorbr br after the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment if you havent already seen the first film i suggest you watch it but dont waste your time with this utter pile of turdbr br
