the matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its twilight zoneish manner the general rule applies here and this sequel doesnt match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesnt even compare with itbr br reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most unprofessional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nosedives after a disastrous first 45 minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groanworthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong zion rave scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but its also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance musicbr br the bullettime aspect of the matrix was a good addition but in reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that the matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the star wars saga havebr br the acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo weavings agent smith the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress br br a poor throwntogether movie the matrix reloaded is a disappointment those who didnt like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this ones for diehard fans only even in the movies own subgenre of special effect bonanzas minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating 4510
