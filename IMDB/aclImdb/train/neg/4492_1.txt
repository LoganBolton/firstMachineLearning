the first matrix movie was lush with incredible character development witty dialog and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story these elements  coupled by incredible special effects of the day  presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time enter matrix reloaded and its sequel revolutions the problem here isnt the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue the brothers have taken welldeveloped characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logsÂ… the connection that was first established between viewers and onscreen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first matrix moviebr br to wit morpheus was developed as a charismatic philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie but here in reloaded  were presented by a different morpheus who stands hard and hollow reduced to corny oneliners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film this character just didnt feel the same and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the moviebr br the removal of tank was also a disappointment tanks involvement in the first film was minimal at best but he played the role extremely well in reloaded we discover that tank dies after the events in the first film and he is replaced by a jar jar binks stunt double that couldnt act to save his live think stale box of kelloggs corn flakes his performance left me chuckling throughout and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing there was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions onscreen or the delivery in the script was off in either case the experience was humorous at times i felt embarrassed for the actorbr br even neos godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences the alleyway battle with the 200 agent smith clones was certainly exaggerated one must wonder for a man so gifted as neo  that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the matrix certainly neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker and more efficiently again such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped in jest our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly sadly for those expecting more of the same  you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointedbr br however if you take reloaded as your standard runofthemill action movie and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of alreadyestablished character development from the first film you should walk away feeling quite pleased
