i tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler i also assume that youve seen the first movie or at least know the general gist so if you havent some of this might not make sensebr br plot this movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across we are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose and destiny and choice and forced to endure the long torturous platitude sessions that contain thembr br neo awakened from a dream in the last movie now begins a period of realization about his own existence there are a lot of revelations in this movie which ill be vague about so they wont seem like spoilersbr br if youre still worried vague references will spoil the movie dont read the paragraph belowbr br the strength and weakness of faith is revealed the strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed the interdependence of humans and technology and our faith in technology are also revealed the importance of choice and experience is revealed explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail so i will refrain as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks btw by revealed i mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nailsbr br storyline so how does neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one in short they keep the faith and use and abuse overlystylized action and bullettime like its going out of style and after this display im hoping moviegoers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more more on that later to not spoil anything i will say no more than the promo material already did neo is still trying to figure out the matrix and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans and zion all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts the movie pretty much picks up where the last one left offbr br action while martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay adding swords sais etc to the mix special effects are so often used and waved in the audiences face that it becomes really tiresome ive discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike and nearly all of them found some of the action sequencesespecially the smith fight we all heard would be in the movieto be too long and tedious this is a huge red flag for action fans because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more or completely content with the awesomeness that just occuredbr br these fights scenes do neither they are overstylized overthetop sequences that are wooden and uninspired in the first movie there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action a sense that fighting was for survival not just looking good which i honestly dont think they manage in reloaded anyway in black and leather go watch drunken master or iron monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences areyou wont regret it in addition the matrix abilities people have in reloaded is not consistent and what they actually do is not consistent the first movie had its inconsistencies here but they werent too glaringunlike reloadedbr br special effects are poured on and on and on every little thing someone does be it just jump somersault spin and in many cases just pose arebr br slowmoed bullettimed or overaccentuated by some sort of destruction its evident the w bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie and boy did they throw it with no real restraint sharp editors could have really helped this but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given which brings us to  br br character and dialogue i have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes actors cant really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audiences face or neglecting it altogether the audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their ownbr br keanus acting performance is stiff at best keanu is good at acting confused and thats about all he does in this film he makes a decent attempt to show passion between neo and trinity but it falls flatbr br lawrence tries to make morpheus everything from moses to henry v and be as cool as a cat throughout with the script he is provided he makes a noble attempt but it also falls flatbr br moss isnt very believable either her look of concern is always the same much like keanus and the chemistry isnt there although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enoughbr br hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an agent program but he too suffered from the scripts hand i actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge drawn out fight scenebr br all in all this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations and on its own as a standalone movie which is not how its supposed to be taken its still horrible i dont see the matrix as deep but i at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas good action a few funny lines and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive reloaded fails on all these counts and i really hope the w bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment granted i dont have a lot of hope left for that after this film
