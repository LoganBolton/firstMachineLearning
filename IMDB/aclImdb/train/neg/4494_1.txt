spoilers spoilers continuedbr br from here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself first we meet a rogue program with the indication were gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like we get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage two ghosts that serve no real purpose and have no character whatsoever and a bunch of henchmen someones told me theyre vampires straight out of blade 2 but theyre so undefined i didnt realisebr br the funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the oracle only for far longer and far far worse he has a simple point about cause and effect makes it then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid his final line before walking off is comparable to storms do you know what happens to a toad line in xmen in levels of utter bland baddness the chocolate cake is such a lazy pathetic cliche and monica bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see herbr br and then we get another kung fu fight why neo is allegedly the one he can do anything he has the ultimate power and what does he use it for kung bloody fu all the time and while he can stop 1000 bullets he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen vampires i wanted to see mind blowing powers i wanted to see him do the wildest craziest most insane s to people because he can do anything i got the same as before without the wowbr br the fabled car chase that cant be bad well no its not its just not what weve been tyold it was going to be all the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer every one so all possibly wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with guess what a kung fu fight ok its not neo but youd have thought hed have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the matrix at least taught them something its not hardbr br hey morpheus dont worry about what happens to you in the matrix its not real as long as you understand that nothings real then nothing can really harm youbr br there you go simplebr br ok so the chase is not bad its never boring and it doesnt seem like 16 minutes its just so underwhelming and still it gets worsebr br the final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable they have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews they then only show it sporadically between morpheuss over long super preachy monologue to make it worse they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is you know basically but you dont know whos doing what when so when one crew goes down you just dont care and you dont know how this is going to affect what goes onbr br ill sum it up though it happens so trinity can get back into the matrix to setup the end thats the only reason it happens which raises the question why did they need to send 6 people originally trinity gets in in five minutes by herselfbr br neos journey to the centre of the matrix so to speak is handled equally lazily ooohhh he runs into another 100 agent smiths woooooo that mustve taken a lot of thought only now theyre in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment man what a grand finalebr br and then the architectbr br remember everything i said was bad about the oracle and the foreign guy add them together and double it thats how truly appalling the architect is the only reasonable potential of him is hes about to set up the cliffhanging climaxbr br and then he blows itbr br lets look at the options he gives neo choose one door and all humanity dies except 27 choose the other and all humanity dies considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesnt really give its hero one if he had a choice of save humanity and the missus dies or save the missus and kill humanity theres the potnetial for inner torment and tension also with trinity being mid fall the potential of a real cliffhanger that wouldve made seeing the third more essential but no he has save noone or save the missusbr br now the very worst thing about the original matrix was neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end the year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid jar jar was they didnt notice that the very end of the matrix made him look him steven hawking the oracle told me id fall in love with the one and i love you come on how can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that wasbr br so what do the wachowskis do in the sequel well they make the ending of the original look better how well by doing almost exactly the same thing again only swapping characters only so much worse i think my f a and r keys would be worn out if i kept writing far before i got to worsebr br and the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger its a reminderbr br basically this film is just bad i really didnt want it to be bad but it is bad in just so many ways and to make matters worse this isnt a film with not enough budget its not a film with too short a schedule its not a film thats been rushed out its not a film where too much influence has come from the outside this is exactly the film the wachowskis set out to make with warners fortune fully behind them and thats what makes this so awful at least rancid aluminium can say that it didnt haev enough time or moneybr br matrix reloaded the worst film ever made maybe not quite the most disappointing and defalting film ever madebr br undeniablybr br
