spoilers of both this and the matrix followbr br i liked the original matrix a great deal it was not a deep movie despite fishburnes attempts to philosophize but it was fairly well paced fun and i have a soft spot for hong kong fightsbr br in the original neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson by day corporate drone and by night brave hacker eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions  does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in interestingly he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions life rather sucks he has his girl by his side and his boon companions but he eats processed swill dresses in sweats and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery still the truth makes him freebr br at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewers mind what if i were capable of the impossible what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like thatbr br further agent smith made a wonderful bad guy as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us he was as unstoppable as a terminator and as mercilessbr br at the end of the matrix neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedombr br this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes when the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are sayingbr br my short list of characterization failuresbr br the oracle goes from mildly helpful if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reasonbr br major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need  the keymaster for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a characterbr br fishburne loses his advisor role and gets nothing to replace it withbr br the people of zion are not particularly likable nor would you really want them running the worldbr br special effects problemsbr br the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable in the matrix you felt neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive in the matrix reloaded he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video gamebr br the fight on the freeway looked quite fake and not that interestingbr br pacing problemsbr br as i mentioned above the fight scenes were interminablebr br the rave went on too long  everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch not because we mind good dancing and good orgies but because we did not know about the people pictured nor did we carebr br whatever hack wrote the creators soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business it meandered used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer the creators speech could have been done in a tenth the time and with more peril as zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix there are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it further the earth cannot support even the people in zion let alone these others you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrixbr br instead we got a long drawn out bunch of twaddle if someone argues that it is deep ask for a transcript and try breaking down the sentences each one is too long by several clauses and uses words with clearer shorter synonymsbr br so in summary not worth seeingbr br i have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it it does not save this turkeybr br the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy this movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomachbr br scott
