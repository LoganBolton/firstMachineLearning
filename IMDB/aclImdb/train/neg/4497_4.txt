 i had planned to write something explaining what i didnt like about this movie but this is going to be more difficult than i thought honestly i cant remember much about it i watched it just three days ago and its made almost no impression on me thats usually the sign of a real stinker about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it the novelty of having a humphrey bogart lookalike as the detective wore off real quick it would be different if he could act but hes a onenote entertainer the kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them if you cant spot the killer five minutes into the movie you need to see more euro horror the casting is a dead giveaway to the killers identity
