watchable little semisoaper but hardly captivating still two or three funny moments what amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable mcnicol is she plays an invalid a leg problem yet she not only isnt the ugly duckling whom men shun but she is even a maneater  and we are supposed to feel for her oh poor little mcnicol with her leg problem poor little mcnicol she is constantly getting passes from men and even dumps them without so much as blinking at one occasion she even has a premeditated onenight affair with a blond stud and then she tells her newlyfound french girlfriend quite nonchalantly that it took him time to get an erection makes us viewers wonder why she is so legconscious if every guy wants to hump her well almost every guy the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone but otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men no shyness no lack of success with men and she throws them away like toys the way she dumped carradine was ridiculous poor little invalid girl i dont think so and yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness nervousness the rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems so this flute scene is absurd and doesnt fit into the bigger picture i was also surprised how quickly and eagerly mcnicol makes friends with a french woman who is screwing a married guy on the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled womans struggle for acceptance or something like that but its nothing like that at all the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves  its the 80s kind of movie  very confusingbr br as far as her leg its not like she has a big fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle she only has a normallooking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg so i really dont understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female quasimodo or something at the beginning of the film its not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck though mcnicol is hardly a major catch kind of cutish but nothing special quite averagebr br but what the hell is carradine doing playing some kind of a relatively smooth guy flirting with mcnicol and her pal this guy was in revenge of the nerds but i guess its the same thing with the carradines in the movies as it is with the kennedys in politics no matter how ugly unable or dumb all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics respectivelybr br down with nepotismbr br if you want to read bogus biographies about the carradines and other hollywood nepotists and morons contact me by email
