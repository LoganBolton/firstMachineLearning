any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen and im still so bored i walk out that is a stinker br br karen gets stuck in paris and befriends a sissilyhandsome french man with whom she is having sex soon of course hes married but cheri why should that be a problem what could be an interesting clash of cultures is believe it or not just dull i walked out br br maybe the movie got a lot better after i left but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten beginningbr br my advice if you find yourself in this run do not walk for the exit save your time and your energy most assuredly save your money its a shame the production company didnt save its money
