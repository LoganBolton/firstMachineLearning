this movie isnt terrible really somebody commented that mo is the type of american europeans snicker at but there are those and not necessarily anglosaxon yahoos who do not care for frenchmen and the xavier character isnt going to sway thembr br lets consider his stereotypical frenchman attributesbr br 1 cynical  very cynical checkbr br 2 reedy underfed appearance check despitebr br 3 a great appreciation of cuisine checkbr br 4 lukewarm work ethic check forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks br br 5 beautiful wife check despite thatbr br 6 loose interpretation of the marriage vows checkbr br 7 big sexual ego which says an american girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner checkbr br whether mo is a hick or not theres no reason for her to fall for this smug european twit other than the script dictates sobr br on the other hand as other male reviewers have i did enjoy seeing karen allens cute petite body ill give the movie four stars two of them are for that
