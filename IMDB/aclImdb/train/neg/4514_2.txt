the trouble with the book memoirs of a geisha is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american mans way of thinking reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music sets and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the charactersbr br the movie isnt about japan or real geisha it is a story about a few american mens mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions so what is this movie if it isnt about japan or geisha is it pure fantasy as so many people have said yes but then why make it into an american fantasybr br there were so many missed opportunities imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hangups no connotations of sin about sex sex is natural and normal how is sex handled in this movie right like it was dirty the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch br br does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie nope one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesnt want to get caught doing something dirty such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geishabr br did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off nope she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block of course she isnt supposed to enjoy it and that is what i mean about this movie why couldnt they have given her something to enjoy why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrongbr br behind mameha the chairman was sayuris secret patron and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity he could have rigged the auction and won her himself nobu didnt even bid so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and reeking of oldman stink get his fingers all over her naked body would any woman ever really forgive a man for thatbr br lets try to make sense of this by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuris geisha training in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr crab through mameha the chairman sold sayuris sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her the chairman wasnt her patron he was her pimp some romantic love storybr br yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive alluring transvestite whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie distortion and terribly wrongbr br some contrasts between japan and moagbr br japanese style  refined elegant simplicity moag style  peking operabr br japanese geisha  hair swept up moag geisha  loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeupbr br japanese shaved ice  japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances shaved ice is strictly a summer treat moag shaved ice  the chairman buys chiyo the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo this treat during cherryblossomviewing season the thought made my entire body shiver with coldbr br japanese geisha  trained and skilled entertainers moag geisha  slutsbr br japanese wind chime  used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the breeze japanese people feel somehow cooler moag wind chime  a door bell if a person stood in front of anothers house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrancebr br japan  emphasis on human relationships group oriented moag  i want a life thats mine american individualismbr br japanese traditional dance  refined elegance an almost geometrical and mechanical precision moag dance  martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a notveryauspicious white japanese funeral shroud performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club ha ha ha is a strip club where they did most of their research on geishabr br japan house fire  setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community fires can rip through those wooden villages towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people moag house fire  great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the outofcontrol fire miraculously puts itself out technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiledbr br enough the movie stinks
