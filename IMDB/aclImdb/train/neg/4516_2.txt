i bought this dvd set sight unseen and wish i hadnt the script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book the lighting is horrid very unpolished but if it was just that i could overlook it the script doesnt focus enough on the charactersthere is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is whoespecially in the planesno idea who dies whenbr br i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters if you dont have that you dont have anything there was no focus on the characters at allyou never got to know themwho they were what they likedwhat made them do the things that they do the series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 partsi bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didnt detail the charactersthey put a lot of filler in iti will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol i mean do we really need to see that over and over again i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters
