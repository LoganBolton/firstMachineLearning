theres plenty to appreciate here spectacular locations and flying sequences period costumes props and sets and competent writing and acting however to enjoy a drama we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire in this bunch of catty snobs we found only one character who is at all likable Â— a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim from the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step but we did not find their maliciousschoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining even the dog is detestable we threw in the towel after two of the six episodes so you should discount these observations accordingly but what i could find written about this miniseries gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption
