few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is pretentious garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiablebr br now that ive got my distress out of my system i am more able to analyse the movie br br  from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english the director of course did not make the movie for an indian audience however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be truebr br  next we get regular glimpses into radhas dreams these scenes are not very effective they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie im still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story i felt that the surrealism was lostbr br  the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement in any case they do not achieve either of the twobr br  the names chosen for the women radha and sita are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences however since the film wasnt meant for indian audiences in the first place the shockthroughnameselection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurdbr br  the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subjectbr br  the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role the others were wasted i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film the male leads were outright rubbishbr br in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please
