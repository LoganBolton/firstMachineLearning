three stooges  have rocket will travel  1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze from 1963 look like a masterpiecebr br the stooges are janitors at a rocket place they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call uni which they bring back to earth with them uni speaks like an average pleasant person  oh hello how are you lovely planet here hope you like it hilariousbr br very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and onbr br the stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost overbr br high point of the film  the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies brutalbr br another writer mentioned the fine musical score huh the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes  ill take romance and there goes that song again both of which are played at the party and that really is the high point of the picture  music from old columbia filmsbr br the tall sexy blonde was nicebr br awful  a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store
