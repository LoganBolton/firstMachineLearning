i dont care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didnt know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with ojs attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every moviegoer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the drama was emotionless i am thankful i didnt have to pay for this unfulfilling experience
