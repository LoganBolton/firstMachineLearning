when this movie was released it spawned one of the alltime great capsule movie reviews sphinx stinks it does but in a mesmerizing sort of way the casting is silly starting at the top frank langella and sir john gielgud as egyptians not enough makeup in cairo for that at least not while this film was being made but its rather amusing to see them try the performances run the gamut from mummylike sorry the obvious observation to overthetop with very few stops in between the lesleyanne down character seems as though she couldnt find egypt on a map much less expound upon its archaeological treasures thats due at least in part to some really bad writing one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie its my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric such as egyptology are ripe for silly overwritten dialogue it doesnt disappoint and the convergence proves a doublewhammy the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension can this get dumber and less believable the answer is usually yes the location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good the only consistent reminders that this wasnt some lowbudget production that and the fact that there are so many wellknown faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher cheap no cheesy yes
