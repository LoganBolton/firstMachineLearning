the robin cook novel coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment  but in the case of sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and leaden pacing the only reason it escapes a 1outof10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself hard to believe franklin j schaffner of patton and planet of the apes is the director behind this debaclebr br pretty egyptologist erica baron lesley annedown is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abduhamdi john gielgud hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica for it could provide vital clues in locating seti is longlost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamuns tomb in 1922 before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen erica attempts to track down the treasure she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly trustworthy for one there is yvon maurice ronet seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives then there is akmed khazzan frank langella an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from herbr br the biggest problems with sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility down couldnt be less convincing as a female egyptologist Â– one assumes she would be quite welleducated and resourceful yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick on those rare occasions that she actually isnt running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4000 year old tomb the plot twists are heavyhanded to say the least mainly comprising of revelations and doublecrosses that can be predicted well in advance one cant even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully sluggish what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium a famous review of the movie declared sphinx stinks never before has a 2hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words
