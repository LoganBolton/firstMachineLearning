some nice scenery but the story itselfin which a selfproclaimed egyptologist lesleyanne down visits egypt and in the course of doing egyptologist things in the most unegyptologistic of ways eg flash photography in the tombs the handling of old parchment etc uncovers a black market turf war and somehow in the span of two days no less becomes that wars jumpsuitwearing epicenteris more puzzling than any riddle the sphinx ever posed down is simply awful as the visiting british scholar that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers certainly but that shes annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely and the rest of the cast including sir john gielgud and frank langella seem as downright confused by the proceedings as i was in short not what youd expect from schaffner planet of the apes patton and cobr br worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which down rails against all male scholars blaming them for her failure as an academic while bathed under the softest light hollywood could muster to top it off she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find wow talk about your performative ironybr br note to wouldbe egyptologists take a year or two of arabic in grad school itll really help out in the long run
