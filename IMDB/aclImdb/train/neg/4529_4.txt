i wont describe the story as that has been done elsewhere we are great clive owen fans and when our netflix recommended the movie we were intrigued br br no wonder we had never heard of this movie because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992 hence the poor production values grainy image  jerky camera work and poor soundbr br but you dont really mind the mechanics because the story itself will put you to sleep its an interesting human story but not at all compelling and there is hardly any ending you dont really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile
