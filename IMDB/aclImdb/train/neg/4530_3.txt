split second might have been a good movie a story about a road rage homicide has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance butbutbr br unfortunately the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camerawork and truly awful editing the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt i suppose to reflect owens stress from business family and traffic what this actually does is to give the viewer a headachebr br since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography one ought not waste time on this travesty
