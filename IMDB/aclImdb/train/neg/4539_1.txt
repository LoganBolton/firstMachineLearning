i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time the movie was boring long long and awful plot the special effects sucks like hell  its like watching a movie back in 1999 its a total waste of an hour and a half of my time matthew settles performance was quite bad i saw him in band of brothers playing ltspeirs he wasnt that bad in fact not bad at all but in this film his acting wasnt convincing enough it was quite bad and there wasnt any chemistry between the rest of the crew either plus his eyes seems empty like hes not feeling it it surprised me really because he was good in band of brothersbr br anyway dont even bother to watch this movie its a big big big waste of time even if you had to kill an hour or two get something else to do besides watching this movie trust me youll regret it
