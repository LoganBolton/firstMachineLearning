if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country the celestine prophecy is a good example 1 perú not even in its most violent times has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film this showed a country like el salvador when civil war since im a peruvian who lives in lima the capital of perú it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here there and everywhere 2 if you have a car in perú and you want or need to be a taxi driver just post a sticker with the word taxi on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets there are taxi companies but their rates are quite expensive no need of yellow or a blackwhite squared band on the doors of your car well taxis in this film have that band somethin that you will never see in perú 3 peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing for example when a taxi driver comes out he was wearing a guayabera cuban shirt a white hat and 40s mustaches like clark gable not one peruvian man looks like that please perú is not the caribbeans 4 a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt like the typical folklore dresses in latin america take a walk anywhere in perú and youll never find a woman wearing like that unless you are watching a typical dance 5 cast couldve been better i can not deny héctor elizondo is a great actor but hes not a latin actor his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico but he was born in new york and his spanish is not fluent its notorious spanish is not his first language there are dozens of very good latin actors who couldve performed as cardinal sebastián petrus antonius general rodríguez was also a bad choice for a latin police officer it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodríguezs office they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish unsuccessfully of course castulo guerra was better in his spanish a peruvian officer who announced cardinal sebastián spoke a quite funny spanish too there are very good peruvian actors like augusto alvarezcalderón and christian meier just to mention two out of many peruvian actors who couldve performed with excellence 6 i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or even countries but please when creating a name be careful when using a foreign language the town portrayed in this movie shouldve been called vicente and not viciente vicente is a male name and viciente has never been used 7 i disagree one user who says that this movie was filmed on locations in perú not one location is peruvian although the production has used in excess posters showing inca kola the peruvian soda as not few american films this one must have used any latin country after all for american producers or directors a latin place is identical to any other latin place 8 in the first scenes when john matthew settle flies to perú hes supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in perú jorge chávez airport in lima the capital actually believe me it must be any airport in the world but peruvian airport and of course in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards 9 when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel this one has a fan and obviously has no air conditioner please this doesnt happen in no hotel in perúand other latin countries unless you get a 1 star hotel 10 the rebels who fight against the government are ¡colombians their accent was with no doubt from colombia for casting them the producers shouldve hired peruvian actors in few words it wouldve been cheaper filming in perúbr br i could go on with more examples out of this film that led me to give it a 1 awful vote but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning but dear producers its not a tragedy there are many worse movies with not few mistakes just lets remember indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull and indescribable disneys the emperors new groove the list of bad films could be endless
