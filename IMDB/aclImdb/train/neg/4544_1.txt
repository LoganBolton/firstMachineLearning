this movie is just not worth your time its reliance upon newage mysticism serves as its only semiinteresting distraction the plot is one that has been recycled countless timesbr br i was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to propup the reputation of this drivel their motivation  objectivity is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well intentioned message of new age consciousnessbr br so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about moviestelevision that support their views in spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis i hope notbr br i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie in spite of the truth
