my dear lordwhat a movie lets talk about the special effects first dont get me wrong here i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past mainly the 60s so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60sbr br what i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message acting is secondary effects are secondary i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies however in a movies like this bad acting incredibility etc add up to make a bad movie even worse  thats what happened for me with the celestine prophecybr br my wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way  the movie failed to do sobr br there could be one single reason to watch this one though if you really love cheesy movies itll be the right one for you if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten starsbr br by the way three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there like critical mass look up the comments on that one  hilarious the celestine prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree
