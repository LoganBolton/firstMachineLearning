i must admit i do not hold much of new age mumbo jumbo when people exchange energy i always wonder how much kj is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem when energy is enforced i always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without nobel prizes when people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life i wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train stationbr br but then again this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them i find perfectly acceptable and entertaining if this were the case with the celestine prophecy i wouldnt burn this movie down but unfortunately it isnt every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location this results in many ahs and ohs like i tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understandbr br the direction is uninspired as well you might expect something more from the guy who did what dreams may come but hey i supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a new york taxi driver its your money buddy the only one who seems to be having fun is alltime bad guy jürgen prochnow not only does he have a job he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring new age chatterbr br this movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up at one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurtsbr br if you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids take my advise choose the latter
