i dont know what that other guy was thinking the fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible you can be as big a believer as you want the majority of this film is mindless drivel i feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it and that alone was no small feat not only is the acting terrible but the plot is never even close to developed there are countless holes in the story to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore ive never read the book so i cant critique on that but this is the first review that ive written here and its purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life i cant remember the last time i couldnt even finish watching a movie this one really takes the cake
