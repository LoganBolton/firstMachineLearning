im surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility the script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the canadian comedy writers union and thats saying something get out your binoculars if you want but theres nothing resembling a joke in sight ronnie corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish the rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability im amazed it lasted past the first episode  correction past the auditions all i can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained and its obvious that the production costs must have been all of â‚¤100 per episode and just in case anyone thinks im commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with english humour i must add that i am indeed english
