disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features two of these were made for their 1991 classic beauty and the beast well these ones arent really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but i think that can usually be expected with sequels however this second one belles magical world is definitely inferiorbr br the film features three short stories all of which take place while belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the enchantress the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize the next story is fifis folly where fifi and lumieres fifth anniversary is coming up and lumiere is unprepared so belle helps him however fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle and thinks theyre actually in love the film ends with the broken wing in this story belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out as he hates birds br br the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disneys third beauty and the beast movie apparently in the dvd version there is another story added called mrs pottss party but ive only seen the original version however since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest i see no point in watching the special edition anyway the first thing i will say about belles magical world is that the animation is very 2dimensional compared to what were used to from disney which would obviously disappoint many people i didnt like beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas that much but you certainly cant say the same about its animation im sure the stories in belles magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones i think and each story has a moral so they could also teach them some valuable lessons however for adults the film really doesnt have a lot i personally didnt find any good humour in it found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way theyre not very well written in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast youre acting rude and foolish is a bit cheesy and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these storiesbr br by the time this straighttovideo movie first came out i was around eleven or twelve years old i dont know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disneys 1991 hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldnt have been missing much if i never became aware of this films existence for little kids im sure belles magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans
