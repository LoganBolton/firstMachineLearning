add to the list of caricatures a southern preacher and congregation a torch singer sophie tucker a dancing chorus and the mills brothers  it only makes it worsebr br contemptible burlesques of negro performers who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race though the negro comedy may have been accepted in its day its extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldnt have been offended i dont think that id have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an 11yearold white boy however i might not have understood some of it
