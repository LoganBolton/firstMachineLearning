what the bleep do we know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe we are presented with a parade of apparent experts none of whom are named who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal miniplotsbr br the film pilfers themes from science philosophy theology and politics minces them together without any regard for accuracy and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult to answer question the filmmakers would like to point their finger atbr br it is riddled errors and logical nonsequiturs how did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism its like saying two plus two equals four therefore i can move objects with my mindbr br there is nothing original in this film and almost nothing that is accurate any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavyhanded editing intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on
