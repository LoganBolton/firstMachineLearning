i didnt know much about this movie before i watched it but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested what i didnt know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of newage blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or dramabr br marlee matlin is in the movie in order to give this new age symposium some sort of a storyline her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speakers thoughts so we wont die of boredom matlin has a real job as a photographer unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch we get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all means to them the one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from india i assume but i think he showed up for the wrong filmbr br it looks like barbara eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs it looks like quark from ds9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film there is a lot of whizbang cgi were supposed to be impressed with cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds because the filmmakers have apparently seen flubber one too many timesbr br people in the movie say that the arawak people on san salvador thought columbuss ship the pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before as if people today had any way possible way of knowing of course they leave out all of that information and just say columbuss ships were invisible to the indians in america the film takes many such arrogant leaps thomas young did a doubleslit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time and a wave some of the time of course youd never know this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that atoms can be particles and waves and that must mean that people can pass through walls walk on water and never grow old if they just wish upon a star then im sure marlee matlin could stop being deaf if she just believed hard enough im being sarcastic but this film is chockfull of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them dont really holdbr br these are new age kooks who have grabbed onto quantum theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation zero point energy crystal healing etc if these snakeoil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling couldnt they just wish their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film we get to listen to another nameless man with no credentials that we know of talk on his couch in front of a fireplace or tv screen about how he creates his own life every time he was on the screen i wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face these people take themselves way too seriously some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever really touches anything because theres a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level if only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach screaming im not touching you im not touching you a moral relativist in the movie claims that theres really no such thing as good or bad so apparently its ok that hitler gassed millions of jews to death another person says that there is no such thing as love its just a chemical and that we really dont love people were just addicted to the chemical rush we have when were around them i suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many yearsbr br we are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception seeing everything like robocop they evaluate if women are cows dogs or foxes and a sexual position pops onto the scree marlee matlin gets drunk at the wedding shes supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because shes a beautiful and unique snowflakebr br i liked when the film said people often find evidence for their preconceived notions perhaps in this review im only seeing what i want to see but i truly wanted to see these people get pies to the face and it never happenedbr br if youve never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before you may find them interesting but there are better sources for all of the ideas here if you want to watch a good movie that talks about the heisenberg uncertainty principle go see the man who wasnt there if you want to read a good book about quantum field theory read hyperspace by michio kaku if you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals see waking life although it can feel boring selfimportant and pretentious at times all in all you should go and read quantum psychology or prometheus rising by robert anton wilson instead of wasting your time on this moviebr br i normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 but this one was a very easy for me 110 starsbr br the movies title is true the people in this film dont know  hands down the worst movie ive ever seen
