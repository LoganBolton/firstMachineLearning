i went into this film expecting it to be similar to the matrix or pi boy was i wrong yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie with cg animated cells and peptides to boot however the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feelgood hogwash in between plot segmentsbr br sure it stars off innocently enough there is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning it states for example that electrons exist as both particle and wave and that an atom is mostly empty space however the movie takes a giant and unscientific leap saying that subatomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well the talking heads take it even further according to them the following are truebr br when columbus arrived in the caribbean the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different meditation can reduce the murder rate with positive thought you can walk on water your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of waterbr br and hey thats only in the first 40 minutesbr br watching the movie was torture this film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult after doing my homework i realized that it basically is just thatbr br on the other hand this could be seen as a campy comedy albeit one thats not funnybr br save your time and money dont see this movie
