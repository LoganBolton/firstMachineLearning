at first glance this documentaryfictioncartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking of course when something provokes thought it can then be scrutinized the reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions the link that what the bleep would have you see between science and spirituality is in fact not rooted in science at all the transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area washington dc in this case in reality the hra homicides rapes and assaults crime rate was about 30 higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988Â–1992 there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study in fact each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunkedbr br my conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke either way i suggest that you do not waste your timebr br if you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts you might consider mindwalk 1990
