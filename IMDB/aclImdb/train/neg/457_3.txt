sure i like short cartoons but i didnt like this one naturally kids would love it but then again im not a kid anymore although i still consider myself youngbr br i will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess its because people in the 30s were more happy with not much than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesnt allow men to be slow thats really a shame i wish i lived in the 30s because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guessbr br to conclude if you like music and frogs youll have to see this cartoon otherwise dont spill your time on it
