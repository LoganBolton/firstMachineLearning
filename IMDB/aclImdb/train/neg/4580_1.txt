im still trying to decide if this is indeed the worst film i have ever seen  a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many bsers who populate this film the bs to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one  at the end the interviewees seem to be saying we want you to think  but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as factbr br if you feel that you are openminded and wish to expand your consciousness please be openminded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory einsteins universe nigel calder a slim volume not a challenge the cosmic code by heinz pagels if you cant bring yourself to read a book please dont complain to reviewers about being openmindedbr br to recap this film is just unbelievably badbr br you know whats a really good film which questions the nature of reality thirteenth floor directed by roland emmerich with craig bierko gretchen mol vincent donofrio smart sexy thoughtprovoking
