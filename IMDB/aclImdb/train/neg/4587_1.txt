well what can i saybr br what the bleep do we know has achieved the nearly impossible  leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as the postman the dungeon master merlin and so fourth it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety and that ladies and gentlemen is impressive indeed for i have seen many a bad moviebr br this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their newagy pseudophilosophy basically if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g this movie is for you if you have a sense of humor a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a sizable portion of good weed then this movie is for you as well otherwise stay away take my word for itbr br the first thing that struck me about what the bleep do you know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera complete with pink heart effects computergenerated sparkles across the screen and other assorted silliness who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you the movie was permeated with cheesy gci the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via overthecounter video editing software but never would because its just way too ridiculousbr br the script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief but the writers felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information or rather disinformation which is what most of this movie was all about all the way down your throat well given the target audience that may not have been too bad of an idea the main character for example spends half the movie popping pills apparently though it was deemed not convincing enough so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout which refer to her antianxiety pills specifically just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down the acting well ive seen better acting in ed wood movies and no this is not an exaggeration heck the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this it really didbr br the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads a strange mix of kooky scientists kooky doctors and selfproclaimed mystics go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life reality you see is a probabilityfield of a bunch of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it what happens when more than one observer observes they didnt say but then again who cares listen to enya meditate observe and you shall be god and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking logic etc all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a paradigm shift and go down the rabbit hole furthermore the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities parallel universes and suchbr br speaking of rabbit holes the analogy permeates the movie all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes im not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing but one thing im certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex actually the movie is extremely antisex throughout sex is presented as dirty ugly and antienlighteningbr br in any case the talking heads talk the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started withbr br i want 2 hours of my life backbr br heres a couple of random quotes which i happened to rememberbr br what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me and that which i used to consider real is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal  some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physicsbr br what does it take for one man to have an erection it takes just one thought nothing changes on the outside all the changes are within an yet he has an erection  some self proclaimed mystic head of her own school of enlightenmentbr br while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you i hate you youre fat youre ugly i have you  main character the fat and ugly photographer
