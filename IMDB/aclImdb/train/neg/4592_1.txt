this movie made me very angry i wanted desperately to throttle the scientists and unseen filmmakers during the course of it very very painful to sit through sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way the little good information on brain functionchemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sht the worst offenders were the crackpot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza mr dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he on the other hand is living on a higher plane even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed clumsy superior pretentious preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them i think thats what made me so angry the fact that theyve taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world fittingly the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and clich√© riddenbr br i would refer people instead to bill brysons excellent survey of science a brief history of nearly everything theres plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual established science
