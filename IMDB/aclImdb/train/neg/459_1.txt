i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistakebr br i cant write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book thats not funny thats patheticbr br low budget effects if i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no moneybr br acting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that theyve agreed to take part in this looking at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they dont even come across as sexy let alone funnybr br this movie is not even in the sobaditisfunny category its just bad as if everybody involved was sick of itbr br avoid
