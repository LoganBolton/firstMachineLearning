i dont know anything of the writers or the directors earlier work so i hadnt brought any prejudices to the film based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interestingbr br but implausibility was piled upon implausibility each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed gruesome makeup or special effectsbr br the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing it was positively repulsivebr br i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but ill give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gorebr br chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim wendt out of the deep freeze mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendts demise what are the cops going to do measure his bite radius mckenna unwraps wendts head and neck from the freezer bag its in takes an ax and begins to chop off wendts head whack whack whack the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendts neck the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh one of which drops on mckennas head he brushes it off when hes done mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire hes built he sits the head on the ground squats next to it takes out some photos of a woman hes just killed and shows them to wendts head remember her we could have really made it if it hadnt been for you guys he tells the head duke youve always liked bonfires havent you he asks then he places the head on the fire we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flamebr br i dont want this sort of garbage to be censored im only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuffbr br theres no reason to go on with the rest of the movie well ill mention one example of an implausibility since i brought the idea up mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack he knows hes going to be clobbered half to death in the following days hes literally invited the heavies to do it what would you do in this poelike situation heres what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life he finds a discarded calendar with a pinup girl on it and masturbates successfully give that man the medal of freedom br br a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks the camera is often hand held and wobbly the dialog has lines like life is a piece of s or else its the best of all possible worlds it depends on your point of view use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero mckenna walks towards us in the foregroundbr br some hero he is too he first kills a man for 13000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue then a potted plant before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body this bothers him a little but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment then i hope i have the order straight he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it next he burns the head honcho baldwin alive then having disabled the two lesser heavies he deliberately blows them up though one of them isnt entirely unsympathetic and were supposed to be rooting for mckennabr br these arent cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either  bang bang and youre dead these are slow and painful the first one  the murder for 13000  is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life it isnt really easy to kill another human being as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain but that scene leads to no place of any importancebr br some people might enjoy this especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies some meretricious stuff on screen here
