i was ped when i couldnt see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight i put it on remind as soon as i could so was it worth the wait well lets backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot sean crawley is a young man who doesnt know what his path in life is enter duke george wendt who introduces him to his boss ray danny baldwin one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around and it goes on from there which leads me back to the question posed was it worth the wait yes and no the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me he just took the ball and ran with it but its nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped but fumbled and taken in the other direction i know where this point happened exactly but cant say without spoiling the film but needless to say it happened the ending doesnt save the film either poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like reanimator or castle freakbr br my grade cbr br where i saw it showtime extremebr br eye candy kari wuhrer shows her tatas in one fantasy and then in the next more tatas and it pans down andoh my god my eyes my eyes
