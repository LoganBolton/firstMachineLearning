this movie is written by charlie higson who has before this done the legendary fast show and his own show based on one of fast shows characters tony the car sales man hes also written james bond books for kidsbr br actually ive seen before this only gordons movies that are based on lovecrafts stories and every one of those is marvelous here gordon tries to do something different the style is totally contemporary which means shaky camera fast and strange cutting cool chillout music in the background it works quite well here i guess but its still pointless and cheap it makes me often think of the cameraman whos shaking his dvcamera in front of the actorsactresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures hoping that something tolerable would come out of it the casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere which is the result of good directing i think the main character the zero young guy is quite interesting in his zeroness the fat guy is also good and the guy who looks like alec baldwin but is not him but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something notsointeresting in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness there is not much humanity in this filmstory its totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead needless to say that there is no humor either its a 140 long vomit without no relief in any moment anyway gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today and i think of this movie as an experiment and as a failure in that everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes just to learn and to find their way again this might be gordons most uninteresting and empty work
