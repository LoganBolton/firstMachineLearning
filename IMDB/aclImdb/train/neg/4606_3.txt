this movie was an attempt to go into places most dont and perhaps shouldnt venture into it was a similar trial at the bizarre headcase perspective given to us in the cell although not near as indepth and well portrayed the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it then as the movie takes its supposed dramatic turn the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place br br basically the idea is that of a kid chris mckenna who needs money he takes on the role of a hit man killing a city accountant then he doesnt get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the brilliant idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused he begins to go crazy some very disturbing scenes then thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over he visits the wife kari wuhrer of the man who he killed and wins her affections soon after she discovers who he is tragedy strikes and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers daniel baldwin george wendt vernon wells for their previous kindnessbr br i got to ask though what is it with kari wuhrer and horrorgore type filmsbr br it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre granted i liked her in eightlegged freaks and she was okay in anaconda but despite all her obvious cuteness and allure wow shes hot she can act much better and chose better roles or maybe im wrong and that is just a misconception for all you guys out there you get to see the fully monty of her in this film although its rather bizarre and shortlived i almost felt like she did some softporn after watching this film something not foreign to karis career the sexsimulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming br br anyway i will say there is some good acting just dont expect much of it from daniel balwin whose career seems forever destined to second his brother alexs the film did bring out a few old greats though george wendt norm from cheers and vernon wells commando weird science above all chris mckenna does the best job in playing the main character sean crawley his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth bring some elements of substance to the film br br i wouldnt go out of my way for this one if youre bored and are tired of the same old episodes of the hitchhiker then i might advise watching thisbr br and kari please start acting in some better films
