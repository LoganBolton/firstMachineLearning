you cant imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants as a massive gordon fan i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipationespecially since i loved dagon  gordons last achievement  so much king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it unfortunately i couldnt go and congratulate him for it afterwards king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date really the quality level never surpassed ordinary tvthriller standards the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes the typical gordontouch is never recognized on top of that the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese it involves a young wannabecrook whos hired to commit a murder so he doesand of course theyre not paying himand of course he falls in love with the victims wifeand of course he avenges himself only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and theyre the only ones reminding you of the fact youre still watching a stuart gordon film the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife george norm peterson wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the goodhearted sex bomb extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly while the makeup effects arent enough to even satisfy amateurhorror fans i read a few other comments on king of the ants claiming its gordons best since it finally is a thoughtprovoking and mature filmwell if thats the casei rather stay immature and give reanimator another viewing thank you very much oh well i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventuallytoo bad it also overcame stuart gordon
