i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said  rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and languagebr br which correctly imo should state  rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and languagebr br the word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost nonexistent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated storywise it was soso afterall who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i dontbr br of course this is only my opinionbr br joseph
