this was a crappy movie with a whole lotta nonsense and too many looseends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron livingston made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it gotmore ridiculousbr br sean crawley goodlooking chris l mckenna whom ive never seen before  but loved his little nude sceneis making ends meet as a painter when he meets electrician duke wayne george wendt from cheers thinking hes getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews daniel baldwin playing a stereotypically evil guy ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ron livingston in a cameo who ive been in love with from office space up to sex  the city ray end up offering the apparently desperatefor cash sean 13k to kill the accountant and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the accountant whose wife kari wuhrer he finds himself attracted to completes the hit and leaves  taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as leverage to get his moneybr br up to this point its a descent flickgenerally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the films writer charlie higson had snapped out of a 10day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something without simply detailing the movie lets just say that in everysinglescene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself gasping what the fk baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many looseends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched itbr br this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to its full value its supposed to be a psychological thriller and mckenna is a decent actor but its hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots girls will enjoy handsome seans gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron livingston is only in the first onethird of the movie
