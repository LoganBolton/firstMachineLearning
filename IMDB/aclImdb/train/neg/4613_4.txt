well then what is it i found nicholsons character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica hustons character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut its not that i dont get it its not that i dont think that some of the ideas couldve lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that were supposed to accept these ideas and thats what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as afunny or beven remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so dont let the hype get the best of youit is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful
