its boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one not because its abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated prizzis honor disappoints some would argue that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i dont buy it only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano a dark character study set in mexico that ranks among the finest he ever did prizzis honor on the other hand a film loaded with star power good intentions and a decent script proves to be a major letdownbr br the overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hitman prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90s but the script is too convoluted for its own sake the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly its trying to be a romantic comedy a crime drama a gangster saga etc jack nicholson doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts anjelica huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her characters motivations she starts out the victim of her bigot fathers disdain she proves to be supportive to her exhusband then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a platebr br the colours of the movie have a washedup quality like it was made in the early 70s and hustons direction is as uninteresting as everything else theres promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it couldve been morphed to something better but whats left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making
