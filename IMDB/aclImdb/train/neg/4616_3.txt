this movie has not aged well maybe its just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that weve seen with the sopranos but i just viewed prizzis honor for the first time on dvd alonebr br the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but i have to say i was just appalled at the ending not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying endingbr br i enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character also when was this move supposed to be set the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the world trade center towers completed in 1973 were clearly visible in many cityscape scenesbr br another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his personbr br somehow mid1980s audiences found this film charming and funny mideighties meet the late oughts only of you can live
