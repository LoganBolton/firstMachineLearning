eight academy nominations its beyond belief i can only think it was a very bad year  even by hollywood standards with huston as director and jack nicholson and kathleen turner as leads i probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway but the oscar nominations really sold it to me and i feel distinctly cheated as a resultbr br so its a black comedy is it can anyone tell me where the humour is in prizzis honor its certainly tasteless the shooting in the head of a policemans wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life but with the exception of a joke about your favourite mexican cigars which i imagine is an old joke for americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything cuban for the last 50 years i failed to spot anything of a comic nature  and i did try there is a lot of mafia cliché but cliché doesnt constitute humour in my bookbr br is it a romantic comedy of sorts never the characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with ben afleck and jennifer lopez in giglibr br is it a cleverly devised parody about the mafia not in a million years the plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd and it usually just has the feel of a really bad and cheap mafia movie it feels more like a homage than a parodybr br with onedimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces well it isnt enough even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression jack nicholson repleat with puffed up top lip  now is that meant to be a parody of brandos padded jowls in the godfather oh who cares all i know is it isnt funnybr br throw in some slow plodding direction this film drags on for 2 hours some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as you remember the camora well were far bigger well track you down wherever you go and clichéd mannerisms and youll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say capiche prizzis honor is far from being hustons masterpiece and is rather a very poor last work its definitely one work in the great directors canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the hudson river
