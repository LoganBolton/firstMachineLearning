oh how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since dw griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as the yellow man characters so unimaginative and unengaging that its difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this filmbr br prizzis honor is a film that ends up being an absolute postmodern disaster in every which way possible the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character prizzis honor is a film that falls into a genre of neonoir comedy romance action gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story some sort of a sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at allbr br ill give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is firstly the film thinks its a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of my time charley partanna nicholson is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoos nest more than an international hitman he meets and falls in love with irene walker turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out it appears all is not right i read that the plot for this film is a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other well yes thats true but that actual revelation doesnt happen until about twenty minutes to the end nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of 60 he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is a hardbodied best of the best international hitmanbr br so with a main character who is unlikable and unrealistic we move to the script the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again do i marry her do i love her what is love what do i do and it gets so repetitive its not even able to act as good humour this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called maerose prizzi huston played by director johns daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it  that got me thinking was this supposed to be funny should i be laughing the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding alá the godfather and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters police men and assassins were introduced into the film but what we get is something very very differentbr br the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot right the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kickstart i was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene isnt even edited correctly some suspense some drama do i shoot or dont i maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before its too late  anything but how it was actually executed prizzis honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax its a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and dead chauffeurs blink when nudged prizzis honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any filmgoer and dont say it was a comedy because i didnt laugh with it  at it is another matter the film is repetitive drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality  there is no honour here
