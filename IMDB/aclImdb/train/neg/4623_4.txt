if you havent seen the gong show tv series then you wont like this movie much at all not that knowing the series makes this a great movie br br i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problemsbr br 1 its a funny snapshot of the era it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 you get a lot of funny cameos of people youve seen on the show 3 its interesting to see chuck the host when he isnt doing his on air tv personality 4 you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv showbr br i wont list all the bad things because theres a lot of them but heres a few of the most prominentbr br 1 the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length 2 the movies story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point 3 chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970s flatnessbr br its a good movie to watch when you dont have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once watch 20 minutes at a time and its not so bad but even then its not so good either
