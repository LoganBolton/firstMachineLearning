misty ayers had a smoking body and thats all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic id like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released what i learned from this movie that womens lowrise panties existed in 1954 im talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing except for bra and panties sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out godzirra effect
