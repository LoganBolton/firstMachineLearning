released in 1965 but clearly shot years earlier this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front as usual for grindhouse flicks of era theres a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music annoying narration and awkward editing the coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines all we get are reaction shots to the offscreen characters voice 50spretty misty ayers strips to her frenchcut panties a couple of times before the action gets started shes accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to motherdoesthedishes mixed randomly to produce among other things the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film watch as he taps it watch as he strikes the match will he inhale or will he be captured by apaches only time will tell the film tells the sordid tale of how sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse falls for a dope and cant escape for some reason were treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the client√®le some stupendously lame comedy boozy dame accidentally drinks milk har dee har and silent film acting doesnt help this is one of the worst feature films ive ever seen even on the something weird video marquee its really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinemavery bad cinema
