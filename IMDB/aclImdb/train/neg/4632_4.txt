maria bello doesnt seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in maybe she needs those movies to get off the sugar coated aka hollywood ones she does here and then coyote ugly and of course mummy 3br br while i think fails to achieve what it sets out to do i wont spoil that maria bello is as great as in her other independentsmall movies she stars in its her performance that elevates this movie this combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me but in the end and even if i try to overlook some flaws like bad pacing and dramaturgy the movie is still too long
