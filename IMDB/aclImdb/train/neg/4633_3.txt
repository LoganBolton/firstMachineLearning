as is often the case films about selfloathing characters do not usually make for good drama downloading nancy is no exception its supposedly based on a true story about a woman whos murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internetbr br the protagonist is nancy maria bello who is married to albert rufus sewell albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and barrestaurants unlike most human beings albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world throughout the film albert has a grim and dour expression on his face he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes when his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence insteadbr br nancy is equally onenote as a character not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film her selfloathing takes the form of selfmutilation and a result shes forced into therapy however she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be madebr br finally nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet hes sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot its revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them the childrens mother no longer wants anything to do with himbr br nancys plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her theres a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club it seems that louis has a twofold plan in going to see albert 1 berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancys fatefirst he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future nancys fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some feelings for her we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancys murderbr br what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence is that the main point of the film is sympathy for nancy actually warranted i dont think so the films writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancys decline but are people so onedimensional in real life i think not they have the repulsive louis a man who makes a living by inflicting pain come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy furthermore his expressions of love towards nancy before he kills her is supposed to show his sensitive sidebr br in the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography
