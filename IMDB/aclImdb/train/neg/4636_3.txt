the confidential part was meant to piggyback on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day however despite the agrade bmovie cast and some good script ideas the movie plods along for some 73 minutes its a cheapjack production all the way whats needed to offset the poor production values is some imagination especially from uninspired director sidney salkow a few daylight location shots for example would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thickear material but salkow treats it as just another payday exercise too bad that brian keiths typical lowkey style doesnt work here coming across as merely wooden and lethargic at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr goes over the top as a wildeyed drunk clearly salkow is no actors director but youve got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication too bad she wasnt in charge my advice skip it unless youre into ridiculous bargirls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical straitjacketed 50s fashion
