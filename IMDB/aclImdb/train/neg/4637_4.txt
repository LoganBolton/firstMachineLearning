bangville police supposedly marked the debut of the keystone kops named after the studio they worked for in this one however they dont dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fastpaced car thats their trademark anyway mabel normand is a farm girl here whos begged her dad for a calf she later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police one answers and the chase is on next mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in turns out its her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there so while mabel blocks her door with furniture the mother and father try to fight their way in this was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast its over before its begun the only real characterization thats developed is mabels who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except of course when shes frightened its easy to see why she became a star its largely because of her that id recommended seeing this at least once and why im giving this a 4
