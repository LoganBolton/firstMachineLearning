blonde and blonder was unfunnybasically it was a ripoff girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and musicway too much background noises and music if you ask meit starts out immensely boring and totally inaneit doesnt pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried onmaybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutesi found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end but that was the only partalso i couldnt help but like pamela anderson and denise richards characters a littleeven though this movie didnt get any laughs from me it kept my attentioni wouldnt say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder
