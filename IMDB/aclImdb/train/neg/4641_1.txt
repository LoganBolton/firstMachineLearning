i sometimes enjoy really lousy moviesthose that occasionally result when people even talented people get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster movies like attack of the killer tomatoes plan 9 from outer space manoshands of fate and heavens gate etcbr br so when i heard that this movie rachels attic was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade naturally i just had to see itbr br boy do i regret that decision this movie is beyond badit is so bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie the acting filming script etc are even worse than a low budget porno film the sound is utterly horrible the plot is completely incomprehensible the acting is laughableit is a complete waste of everyones time and money at least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple and a mad hatters tea partybr br the lighting is nonexistentmany scenes take place in semi or complete darkness which is probably just as well the writerdirector i use the terms loosely david tybor tries to get kinky with bondage scenesbut the results would be laughable if they werent so pathetic there is some nudity but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant i could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of filmbr br for the love of god avoid this train wreck i know that despite or perhaps because of my negative comments you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as i claim it to bebut trust me on thisits even worse than i have said and you will absolutely positively regret the experience and expense if you waste your money on a purchase or rental
