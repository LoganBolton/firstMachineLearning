this is a bad b movie masquerading as a mockumentary the porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character that completely destroyed any documentary feel that they may have wanted to createbr br the fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of its problems the film is not funny the film is not sexy the film doesnt have anything insightful to say about the porn business its not even particularly salacious while theres simulated sex the amount of nudity is mild for an r rated filmbr br someday someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry this is not it
