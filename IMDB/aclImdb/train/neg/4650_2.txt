with a cast of stalwart british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons  i couldnt quite believe how awful it was i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time but this was really hard goingbr br as others have noted a major problem is that it doesnt seem to know what it wants to be a gentle romantic comedy a slapstick comedy or a musical i was a bit gobsmacked when jeannie carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in its not believable on any level either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave donald sinden as a songwriter a songwriter for gods sake the fact he has diana dors for a fianc√©e and doesnt appear to have the slightest interest in her i mean diana dors come on and a ludicrous scene in a song publishers office the whole things silly in the worst possible waybr br if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor wilfred lawson  after that everything went downhill in a big way
