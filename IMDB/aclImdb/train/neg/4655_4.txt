i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt the opening moments with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter diana about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art give the impression that this could be a kickass artsyvampire flick turns out this initial impression turns out false oh troma the mark of some kind of lack of quality sometimes theyll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junkfood craft or sometimes not this is a case where its not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor ie the protagonists father is an old vaudevillian who does jimmy durante impressions are weak at best and any unintentional laughs are undercut by sergio lapels bargain basement directionbr br and its not without him trying oh lord no he does try a lot which is a big part of the problem he and his producers had money for lights sure but the way theyre used in the movie made i a former student filmmaker and aspiring director sulking in my seat if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances and would wonder whether or not his dp understood really the basic 3point lighting setup while this along with a very lackluster sound design or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene shouldnt be something that comes to attention during a troma release it should be something basic that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isnt very funny or scary and it isnt or if lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre momentsbr br its not a good movie by any stretch and perhaps if youre a vampire diehard or just a vampire period it might have some appeal as a lowrent bargain basement alternative to near dark or as a slight improvement over say 1972s blood freak you have better ways to waste your time overall
