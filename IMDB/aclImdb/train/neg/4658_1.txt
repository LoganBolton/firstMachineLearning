brief encounter is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 david lean classic which was based on noel cowards play still life a doctor removes a particle of grit from a womans eye at a railway station he is in a miserable relationship she is happily married social worker of italian ancestry they meet by accident on another occasion form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every wednesday the pair fall in love but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part cowards original oneact play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love sophia loren and richard burton two super stars and veterans of hollywood epics are nobodys idea of ordinary people loren in particular is miscast  sophia loren in full makeup looking like a million dollars working as a parttime voluntary social worker at a citizen advice bureau just doesnt ring true burton looking haggard with dyed hair too much makeup and wearing platform shoes doesnt come across as your average general practitioner that said you cant really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt lorens husband jack hedley potters around the house all day and is terminally boring the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous their final scene together will induce nausea youve been a long long way away etc that great british jobbing actor john lemesurier has a three minute cameo as burtons friend and appears to be slightly inebriated speaking his lines in a barely audible voice its a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal awful rehash of a cinema classic avoid at all costs
