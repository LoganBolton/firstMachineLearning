when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean im sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and theyre playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20s not their 40s the story was just plain bad and obnoxiousbr br dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blondes they really dont have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world its just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think theyre just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girlsbr br denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens its more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshellbr br 110
