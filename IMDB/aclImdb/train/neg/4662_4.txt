the writers probably had no experience in the army and probably never glanced at a history book but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a longneeded look at the role of black soldiers in the second world warbr br the action is confused and unbelievableany episode of combat has better production values but the cast is interesting seeing new york giant rosie greer was worth the buck i paid for this the art direction is fifth ratethe men wear korean war uniforms and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the us army reached germany in 1944 not sunny as they show here and i dont think the terrain resembled northern california the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying springfield rifles instead of m1s which second rate troops probably would have been issued withbr br this basic story idearacist southern officer commanding black troops should have been expanded into a big budget production back then and its not too late to try it now you have to take this for what it is and i admire the creators of this film for making the effortbr br i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944
