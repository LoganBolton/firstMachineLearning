i really wanted to like the pillow book intriguing story interesting character outlines ewan macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether unfortunately i hated every minute of it greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely and not to the films benefit i wont even get into vivian wus abysmal actingbr br you get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music thats playing it seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot and got entangled with foofoo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything its a bit like presenting a john singer sargeant portrait in a chintzy hallmark frame that says grandma loves me in big sparkly lettersbr br this movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteurs ego instead of what it could have been  disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful in another directors hands jeunet coppola it could have been a masterpiece in greenaways hands its best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously
