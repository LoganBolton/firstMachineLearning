this adaptation like 1949s the heiress is based on the henry james novel the heiress starring olivia de havilland remains as a wellrespected piece of work though less true to james original story than this new remake which retains james original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever and considers her as well as all women simpleminded when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style like shes acting through gritted teeth shes not bad in this and she handles her role relatively deftly  its just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character garners a lot of sympathy shes not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the wellmeaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet offering too little story in too long of a movie
