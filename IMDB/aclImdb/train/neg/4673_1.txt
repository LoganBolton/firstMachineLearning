i love henry james books and washington square was no exception i was very excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title jennifer jason lee is an exceptional actress and ben chaplin good enough to play the lead roles albert finney is miscast and doesnt carry the role well i wanted to shoot maggie smithor rather her silly insipid role the real problem and whats lacking in this latest version is a good script music and directionbr br i fell asleep in the theater watching this long drawn out and exceptionally boring movie there are more pauses in the dialog than a pinter play in the book i felt a deep caring for catherine sloper and her life the movie had just the opposite effect i also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to morris eeeeeeeek yukbr br watch it if you cant sleep its a definite snoozer dont watch it if youre depressed youll need zoloft after thisbr br sure the heiress was exceptional with olivia haviland and montgomery clift in the title roles the actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring cold fatherstill grieving for his dead wife and hating catherine for it the movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this onebr br this movie was a box office flop i have no doubts as to why
