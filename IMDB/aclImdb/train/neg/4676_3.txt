edwin porters 1903 short film entitled the great train robbery bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film just like melies a trip to the moon critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema in my eyes they were right it had everything from the planning the actual heist of the train the murder of an unwanted civilian and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time from here to eastwood every western filmmaker has used porters image in some form or another to create their own story one cannot say that this film didnt open the door but the struggle comes from the story itself the genre was defined by porter but outside of its initial excitement  there really isnt anything to grapple onto perhaps i am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their haphazard messages but how can something be cliché before being cliché to me the great train robbery seemed forced untraceable and unsurprisingbr br unlike melies porter tells a very linear story robbers change the course of a train rob it then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains and the final scene ends like any predestined film without any surprises or glitches and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face it is bland porters film is boring in the edition i watched there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker or to the viewer the issue remains that while it is important porters film has been borrowed time and time again it has in effect become diluted the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has unlike melies early film i cannot watch this again i know what has happened i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c this issue is not only my gripe with this film but also the strongest element to see in such an early film while it was dull the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives was outstanding to see in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream this broke the mold again not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film  it is an important film  it just isnt a great filmbr br overall i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind porter is a talented director and gm anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field but i just wasnt in awe of the film i wasnt expecting big budget effects like melies work nor was i expecting a duplicate of a trip to the moon but i did want to see the same creativity exploration and originality i felt porter played it safe if that can be said with such an early film but i couldnt feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds i wasnt rooting for anyone and the final conclusion proved that the kitschyness of it had worn off minutes after the film started it was pioneering but not monumental the great train robbery has lost its space in the time capsule of cinemabr br grade  out of
