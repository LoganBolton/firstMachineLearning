what an appalling film dont get me wrong gene hackman and denzel washington are good actors but aside from a few interesting set pieces the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting crying sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrongbr br take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand whats going on the scene where denzel washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like scotty in star trek is nothing more than a joke and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the actingbr br let us just hope that the real nuclear us navy is not in the hands of such a scriptbr br
