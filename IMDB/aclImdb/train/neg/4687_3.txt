spoilers although none that arent revealed in the first two minutes of the moviebr br robin williams is actually quite good in this as the friendly lonely emotionally stunted loser sy he makes a very human even sympathetic psycho and really disappears into the characterno small feat for such a recognizable performer br br too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste the supporting performances and performers wouldnt look out of place in a softcore porno it doesnt help that every character but sy is made of 100 cardboard at times the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense we know from the very first moments a that sy is a complete whackjob b that he survives and c that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end so all were left to ponder is the hows and the whys and the answers provided arent all that interestingbr br the plot is plodding and contrived and features some nonsensical moments for instance the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore about two thirds of the way through sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme and the final clich√©d explanation of his psychosis right out of peeping tom is a terrible copoutbr br the dialogue is of the absolute worst sort its not overwritten or awkward or unbelievable or bad in any other way that could be considered fun even for badmovie lovers instead every line is purely hideously functionalits as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said hey i need a workable script on thisin an hour it made me want to scream honestlybr br this movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban bewarethehelp thrillers of the eighties and nineties the hand that rocks the cradle eg and while its certainly unpleasant its never really scary sys fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable but on its own thats not enough to make the film work in the end lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved except robin williams sinks this one 3 out of 10
