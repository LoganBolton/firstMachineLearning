letting the class watch this in english was a bad idea films that are serious and more educational can have an effect but it appears this one didnt have any effect whatsoever on the class  whenever the teacher left conversations quickly started  and i didnt hear the words shakespeare or tempest being used at all and when you look at this it is easy to see why the acting is nothing special  everyone seems bored to bits just reading from the page without a care in the world shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death but i just couldnt understand a word anyone was saying the costumes arent too bad and neither are the special effects  the class may not have loved the film but they werent exactly taking the pss either but it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy the scenes on the ship at the start of the film werent too badly done  though the rain looked a bit unrealistic everything else was done well and good but where were the severed heads and exploding masts where was the death where was the inspiration the character of ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes  but as all was on show he was just another excuse for a joke this film is not in any way appealing to either sex the women and girls wont have any romance or comedy to enjoy and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off the tempest wasnt badly done but this felt like something the producers had to make not something they wanted to make and the general boredom and lack of inspiration show 310
