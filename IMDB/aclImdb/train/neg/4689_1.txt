truly awful film made by cinematographerturneddirector ted tetzlaff decent enough looking film but for a timebomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever ford as someone put it here sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk there are some details thrown around canadian exarmy or raf defused bombs in the war his wife is leaving him but none of these back stories add up to much the bomber himself is a complete mystery why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines for that matter what time period are we talking about here wwii or postwar i assumed the latter which makes bombers motive even more salient generally though just a horrible film there are plenty of good timebomb flicks to skip this one watch any episode of danger uxb for a more exciting time at about the same running time
