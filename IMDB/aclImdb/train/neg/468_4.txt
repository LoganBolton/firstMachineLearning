before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980 barbara bachs cleavage and since the movie received an r rating i expected to see her nude alas no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here stacey nelkin whos supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms bach they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides in fact i dont blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tightfisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the seduction scene he did with ms nelkin this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio whos the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms bach an arab who worships motor oil and a politicians son who loves his girlfriend candy nelkins character so much he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy among the supporting cast tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr whose son robert downey jr has a cameo early on in a soccer scene up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless youre really offended at the scatological and sexual content this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boyalfred e newmanshouldnt be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the pictureps another one of the misfits was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago ill he played rodney ververgaert he also says one of my favorite lines im trying to come
