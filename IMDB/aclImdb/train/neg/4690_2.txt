this british film is truly awful and its hard to believe that glenn ford is in it although he pretty much sleepwalks through it the idea of a bomb on a train sounds goodbut it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film no action no movement just a static train the area where the train is parked is evacuated so its not like theres any danger to anyone either in fact this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters dont a fact apparently unknown to the director spoiler the train actually has two bombs on it but we are led to believe there is only one after the first bomb is defused it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more but at the last minute the villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions reveals there are two nor are we certain when the bombs will go off so we dont even have a classic ticking bomb tension sequence a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn fords french wife thinking about leaving him and then wondering where he is  shes such an annoying character that we dont care whether she reconciles with him so when she does theres nothing emotional about it most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality and none have any problems or issues its only 72 minutes but it feels long because its tedious and dull dont waste your time
