a real blowup of the film literally this british film is boringly madebr br what an exciting plot a terrorist places bombs on a train how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull storybr br glenn ford as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb is given awful writing material to work with naturally just as he is called in his wife anne vernon is about to leave him no wonder we never heard of miss vernon after such a film it would be enough to end her careerbr br that elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia i thought it was highly insulting to show this man even at the end
