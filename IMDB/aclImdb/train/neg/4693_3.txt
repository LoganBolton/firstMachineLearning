this is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most great cast great director great story potential then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhereand says nothing while going there there is no depth here whatsoever no depth of characters no depth of plot no depth of surprise suspense or common sense we know whats happening we are told how they plan to fix the problem they fix the problem throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense then they end the film abruptly wasted opportunitybr br on the plus side glenn ford leads a cast of uk and one french actors who are all fantastic doing an incredibly impressive job with the onedimensional writing they were given one of the absolute favorites is herbert walton as old charlie who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film i also thought the film had a great look to itall shadows and fogvery film noir in feelbr br even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable it still just isnt enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film there are far better glenn ford movies out there the big heat gilda affair in trinidad etc
