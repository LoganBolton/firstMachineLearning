okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie first off the movie is so posed and not real they are all acting they cant sing they are way too full of themselves its awful yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid i mean they say their manager is a kid and there record label is fake its stupid dont see itbr br as for the set up and directing not so bad it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing br br only see this if you dont really like good music also its very corny its not even tasteful i hate to be so meanbut this really is a piece of junk
