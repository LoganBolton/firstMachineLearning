mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for itbut obviously someone there had some common sense when the powersthatbe disowned this waste of celluloidthe editing is el crapo the plot is incredibly thin and stupidand the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that stacy nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shoti never thought i would feel sorry for ralph macchio making the decision to be in this thing but i doand i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece offilmat least mr leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movieand he comes out aheadthere are actually copies of this thing with mads beginning sequence still on itif you can locate one grab it cuz it is probably worth somethingits the only thing about this movie thats worth anythingand a note to the folks at imdbcomthere is no way to spoil this movie for anyonethe makers spoiled it by themselves
