cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings beginning with the cancellation of samurai jack the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular such as the powerpuff girls dexters lab dragonball z etc when the ratings started to plummet cn began putting up some pretty mediocre shows though total drama islandaction and chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audiencepleasing gimmicks there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes george of the jungle or rip offs of other shows such as the marvelous misadventures of flapjack where the title character acts just like spongebob and then theres johnny test which is something of a replacement for dexters laboratory though its much more of a sheer rip off than anythingbr br the shows characters are clearly derived from dexters lab only this time the focus is on johnny a blonde or fieryhaired character who torments his twin sisters susan and mary who just happen to look just like dexter from the orange hair to the glasses the impossible technology there is even a rival genius named bling bling boy or eugene who appears to be sitting in for mandark then theres dookie johnnys best friend and talking dog one of dextersi mean susan and marys early experimentsbr br dexters laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television with its simple but effective art style lovable main character and episodes that dont seem to be a long drag johnny test is a lot different the art style here isnt nearly as eyepleasing in fact it looks absolutely awful the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive like how most of the series episodes consist johnny and dookies quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy whom johnny secretly likes or the twins obsession over a boy next door seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with there is no real connection between the viewer and charactersbr br one thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and marys guinea pig for their experiments these range from turning johnny fat ugly monstrous and even into a woman the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme hes planning in return for his services whenever theres an episode involving this kind of winwin deal it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesnt come completely off the rails never ends satisfyinglybr br the writing ranges from mediocre to horrid however the fat episode constantly repeats its phat with a ph theres a difference you know which is a line that should never be repeated especially when the episode seems to promote child obesity with johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fatbr br lets talk about how the show doesnt completely rip off dexters lab the show tosses in a lot of characters from two meninblack named mr black and mr white a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters and lots of super villains though even here the show again steals ideas for other sources like a mr freeze teenage clone an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from powerpuff girls a bumbling maniac mastermind a trio of evil skater dudes and even a mole man which is probably the most clich√© villain in the mediabr br to top it all off alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters the voice acting is either passable like the voices for mr black and mr white to just plain earsplitting johnny dookie and just about every villain in the show the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined itbr br so in the end johnny test is not a good cartoon its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little childrens interest in the show while its bright coloring rippedoff characters and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens its just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is overpromoting to trick people to watching it like mtv toward rap if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour youd better stick to spongebob because johnny test is more of a test of patience than anything else
