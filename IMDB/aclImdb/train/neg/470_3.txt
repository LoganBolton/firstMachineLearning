i used to love this movie as a kid but seeing it again 20 years later it actually sucks up the academy might have been ahead of its time back in 1980 but it has almost nothing to offer today movies like caddyshack and stripes holdup much better today than this steaming dogpile no ta no great jokes except for the oneliners weve all heard a million times by nowbr br i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being well i was way off the soundtrack had only 23 widelyrecognizable hits not the smash compilation others had mentioned and the frequent voiceovers were terrible the only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the characters lines were before they said them yep i watched this movie that much back then br br the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say
