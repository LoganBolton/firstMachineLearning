my brother is in love with this show lets get this straight i completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of dexters lab and fairly odd parents br br ive never really liked fairly odd parents i mean some things did make me laugh but most of the time its downright annoying and not cute at all this is almost the same way i feel about johnny test except nothing makes me laugh on that show the gags are so stupid and pointless and to tell you the truth maybe its just me but kids dont dress like that yes i do think johnnys hair is awesome but cmonbr br and dexters lab that used to be one of my favorite shows and i still dont mind watching it which makes me disgusted and ashamed of johnny test making an absolute joke out of that wonderful showbr br one more thing the dog is so annoying he is more loud and obnoxious than johnny and the gay accent what the fudge i hate the dog to death and i hope he dies because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show and picking up a gay accentbr br unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show dont watch it
