this show is possibly the biggest ugliest most generic steam pile ive seen in childrens programming thats actually become successful the lead character johnny while i understand hes supposed to represent an ordinary kid isnt likable or even tolerable the jokes are lame overdone ie the whoa didnt see that coming gag come on that wasnt even funny the first time its not even cute and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration and lastly its just plain ugly to look at while kids arent especially critical of artistic talent they still prefer eye candy i cant stand watching the show because in a way the art style is justgross hideous in fact just plain crummy br br i just cant stand that this is getting so much airtime while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldnt be getting my hopes up on it coming back i really miss the old cartoons bring back dexters laboratory the powerpuff girls anything but this crap i guess its just wishful thinking thoughbr br simply put i advise you dont waste your time on this show i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids too and this doesnt cut it
