as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i dont like johnny test now i think i know what people are going to say  how do you know how bad it is have you ever watched it i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesnt hold a candle to my standardsbr br i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amountbr br so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show it tries way too hard to be like dexters lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female there is a talking dogwhy and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat i have others but i dont think i can write them here  i dont mean cursing but i mean i dont know if there is a limit for words everything else though is spot on even a deedee character johnny himself it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoffbr br lastly i want to talk about the jokes remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling yes yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexters lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50 of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears that isnt comedy thats stupid comedy i know what some people are thinking isnt three stooges stupid comedy watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which like chowder makes me mad i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together to much bizarre doesnt equal comedy it makes you just think what am i watchingbr br so it strikes out on all accounts dont watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway shape or form
