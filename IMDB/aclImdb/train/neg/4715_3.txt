i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it i failed horribly cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences but johnny test is entertainment in its lowest form the writing is incredibly predictable and the running gags arent much gags at all kids will love it and thats about itbr br now this isnt to say that its all bad the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat its a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for itbr br some of the characters could be very interesting in theory with a little work the characters could work well together but theyre too onedimensional then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow br br the pace is a bit too fast as well the episodes are too busy leaving little time for clever writing this is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth on the upside however the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and thats really the entirety of the target audiencebr br overall the show looks very good on paper but just doesnt succeed in being funny or interesting this is a show i want to like but im incapable of it theres just so much potential that isnt realized kids will enjoy it but thats about it
