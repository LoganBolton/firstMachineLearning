this show is dull lame and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it original first off the animation is so ugly johnnys hideous and everyones annoying the twins look like teen female dexters from dexters lab and johnny is almost like a more intelligent male dee dee also from dexters lab secondly the plots are painfully lame making them hard to follow the gags are corny and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit especially when it tries to be funny i only saw two episodes but those alone turned me offbr br third off the whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to green days american idiot and while i am not a big fan of that band i find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody and then subtly change it in order to make it their ownbr br case in point its a big fat ugly bore 110
