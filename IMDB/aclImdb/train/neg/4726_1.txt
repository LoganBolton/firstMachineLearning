yet another film about a tortured selfcentered arrogant unfeeling hateful selfdestructive lead character we are supposed to care aboutbr br dont get me wrong i am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly selfdestructive character what i object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy why did this guy hate himself and the world had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for him as it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character not tragic just hatefulbr br after taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and antisocial as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy endingbr br this is not the worst film i have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight man dont waste your time
