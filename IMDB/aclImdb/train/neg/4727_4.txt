this film is really something of a curates egg good in parts in contrast to other reviewers i found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewers interest in the characters and the plot i sat through it because im interested in rocknroll and the dynamics of bands but if i were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie i would have to give it the thumbs down with a few caveats jason behr is good in the part of john livien and quite convincing as a rock singer the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear although we are given hints in liviens wellacted relationship to his parents but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer which it shouldnt be nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film the allusions to john lennon were irritating but i confess im not a beatles fan at any rate livien and his band reminded me more of oasis than the beatles in the sense that there was something derivative about them another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting  albeit middlebrow and highschool level  philosophical musings of the lead character but left the threads of his thinking there only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly when livien says before god there was music ever seen that ad for tia maria in the 1990s before time there was tia maria thats what sprung to mind anyway it seems an idiotic conclusion and the viewer has no idea how he reached it but hes entitled to it fortunately his bassist and friend played ably by dominic monaghan seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds you dont know thatbr br in all the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects into pointless banality or into an interesting and more mature perspective
