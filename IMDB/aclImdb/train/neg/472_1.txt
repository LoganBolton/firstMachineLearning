the only thing i remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed itbr br if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house its so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl spacklers correct me if im wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers theyll lock me up and throw away the key
