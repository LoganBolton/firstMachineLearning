when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his character movies but it was my ambition to own them too what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeenyearold i must have been thankfully sense prevailed and live a little love a little is the only elvis film i ownbr br the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years Â– his first uk no1 in 25 even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie werent exactly first rate however a little less conversation  rollnecks and 60s grooving aside  is a real standout finding a lesserknown song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions its nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated but its also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult and what chauvinistic lyrics too though what other elvis song contains the word procrastinatebr br but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it actually based on a novel kiss my firm but pliant lips  what kind of lame novel would that be this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a comedy dog and a nympho within 90 seconds of meeting him michele carey asks would you like to make love to me quite a fast mover by any standards im sure youll agreebr br i do seem to recall that some of elviss early movies  most notably jailhouse rock and king creole  werent too bad but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh and models dress as pink mermaids theres even a dream sequence for gods sake maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesnt conform to is in not having all that many songs with just four to choose from including the credits number youre waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain of the remaining three tracks then the edge of reality isnt actually that bad though elviss dance to it must surely have been called the bear trapbr br in one sense for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content sadly however with talking dogs middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing youll ever see elviss dignity is obliterated by this movie
