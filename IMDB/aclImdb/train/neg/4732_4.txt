if i write a review about a movie maybe it will stick with me but generally i expect that i will have forgotten ive seen this one a mere two weeks from now so why bother because again i find myself watching a lowrated movie that was fun to watch i didnt expect id to be able to stay in the room while it was onbr br it wasnt great but at least it was not unbearable not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe it was just sweet fluff and if you cant take it stay in the locker room boys i agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic and wont be a total bore to an adultbr br it offers a few good chuckles here and there but nary a side splitter sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining but at least it doesnt suck as so many have said it does maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides br br i have a tendency to grade on the bell curve so a 45 or 6 is actually an okay allaround rating in my book giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing giving it a 1 or a 10 as most have done thus far makes the rating numbers meaningless i cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff or that i am even bothering to write about it am i missing something br br anyway it should be noted that emma roberts performs her role as clairedycat quite convincingly ariell kebbel often written into bch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due you might also recognize bruce spence playing leonard though his role is ancillarybr br surely you can miss this one if you are an adult but if there is a preteen girl in your life rent this movie for her and be prepared not to hate it you might even enjoy it
