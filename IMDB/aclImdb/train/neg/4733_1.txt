i cant believe i actually sat through the whole thing this movie has the worst acting since killjoybr br here is a brief outline of the plot the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach drooling over a skinny blondehaired beach hunk who looks like he hasnt been to the gym a day in his life somehow everyone knows him and every single chick in the movie wants him uh oh here comes the competition the stereotypical hot chick and her best friends who drive an ugly pink car we soon find out jojos mom got the job of a lifetime in australia which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind oh no i think im gonna cry a huge storm comes and fills their swimming pool with nasty water somehow for no apparent reason the little chick falls into the pool and comes face to face with yup you guessed it a mermaid this is where the story really takes off basically they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the hunkbr br this is a preteen flick with acting so bad it makes the 80s look like the pinnacle of oscarworthy performances this movie has all the clich√©s possible the best friends the hunk who everyone wants the hot bad girl and her bitchy friends the scary old man you name it its in there i took one for a lot of people by watching this consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you please dont see this movie dont make it so i suffered in vain
