you like beautiful girls yeah me too what is there bad to say about beautiful girlswomen nothing imo so why would i give this movie only 2 stars out of 5 although it got the talents of chiaki kuriyama and aya ueto br br if i really wanted to watch beautiful people id watch mtv or something thats why this is a movie a so called action movie nevertheless so by definition it does not even really need a plot right im not agreeing 100 but lets say yes to that so what does it need 20 minutes footage from part 1 i might be exaggerating a little bit but it felt like more than 20 minutes  that would be no but then again you never know the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast so hey lets remind them  hey maybe remind them even twice just to be sure they wont forget  at least until the credits roll of course br br so forget about the story about character development about real emotions about the acting and no i dont think women in skirts walking andor fighting is accountable for acting  what does that leave yes the action scenes the action scenes are not bad and thats the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 i was giving this movie a chance but it was a waste of time  you have better things to dowatch believe me
