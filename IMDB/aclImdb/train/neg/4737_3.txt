i loved the first azumi movie ive seen ms ueto in a variety of her tv appearances and ive seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks i have to say that this movie was much weaker than id expectedbr br given the movies cast and set up in azumi they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie but instead it was slow plodding in parts and sprinkled with very poor unconvincing and wooden actingbr br when they bothered to reference the first movie they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak in azumi the title character is the best of a group of superior killers in azumi 2 she seems somehow diminished and lessimpressivebr br thats not to say it was a total loss there were a few decent fight scenes and some overthetop characters unfortunately the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that shusuke kaneko and yoshiaki kawajiri are not ryuhei kitamura and isao kiriyama the latter two truly captured the manga feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite got it
