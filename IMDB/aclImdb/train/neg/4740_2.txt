i am so insulted by this movie its not even funny and i thought mulan was unbelievable however low my expectations of disney have become i never figured theyd do something so stereotypical yet so off there is no respect here for any true chinese culture just the hollywood tradition of random martial artsbr br i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl but fortunately most normal teenage girlsparticularly asian teenage girlsare much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life and from a cultural stand point its almost impossible yes there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion but theyre pretty rare and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars another stereotype maybe but a fairly true one because thats how chinese parents work thats how chinese values work if they wanted to go for authenticity they wouldve made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a lovehate relationship with her familybr br this just adds to my frustration with american movies asian culture isnt about meditation and vague natureoriented phrases that sound wise we dont walk around smiling enigmatically all the time and we dont all know some form of martial arts were a people and id appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesnt portray us as some sad caricature
