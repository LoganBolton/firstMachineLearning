wow this was probably the worst dcom ever i watched the first half hour and i laughed brenda song plays wendy the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen she is supposed to save the world as a warrior and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts shin teaches her the skills of a snake tiger etc and she has to learn certain techniques to save the worldbr br this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horriblebr br brenda song is a comedic actress and i cant see her playing a serious role it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin shin couldnt act at all and everything was totally unbelievablebr br i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and the thing i came up with was the power rangers this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power rangeresquire that it was just corny and stupid the characters werent likable and i just couldnt stand to watch it disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel along with other movies like jumping ship color of friendship go figure read it and weep  stuck in the suburbsbr br if you like actionadventure and corny jokes youll like this movie
