there are several things wrong with this movie brenda songs character being one of them i do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor i honestly dont i believe she is given poor lines she is just supposed to be that vain rich girl and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in it cant even get a dry laugh from me herebr br either way i really should have known what to expect when i sat down to watch this filmbr br the movie was not that terribleinitially wendys reaction to shen was completely natural i mean how would you feel if a man claiming to be a reincarnated monk chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight the great evil and save the world which brings me to another point i know this movie is entirely fiction but it is still has a founding in chinese culture it seems like all of the warriors in wendys family line were women correct me if im wrong but i doubt that the monks wouldve just been okay with that sure maybe they couldve worked it in somehow but they offered no explanation whatsoever by doing so they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by hollywood and the mediabr br nevermind that however let us continuebr br wendys character becomes more unbearable as the film go on yes she is a teenager and it is near homecoming i mean who wants to fight evil during homecoming the problem is when the evil starts to manifest himself wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be she is extremely careless even for someone like her she continues not to care about her training i will use this conversation as an example shen if you do not win this battle evil will take over and everything good will be gone wendy whoa talk about pressure welllets talk about something else yes lets wendy lets also go dancing when you should rightfully be training of course shen lets her but his character has an excuse better that he cooperate with her than that he not and she not train at all and get them both killedbr br oh speaking of which shen also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle as he had for her greatgrandmother i am assuming that partbr br this makes wendys actions more unforgivablebr br as the scriptwriter would have it wendys homecoming and this great battle are on exactly the same day do you know what wendy does do you even have to guess yes she does end up going to the battle for when she tries to leave for homecoming the monks who shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she felt weird fighting an old man inform her that shen has gone to battle alone so she goes to save himbr br we initially see some halfdecent fighting that is actually entertaining until finally the great evil comes out of wendys rivalforhomecomings body and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriorsbr br dont askbr br anyway wendy gets all panicky then shen goes and defends her from this guy forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name and manages to get himself killedbr br wendy catches shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the airbr br she screams title of said article outbr br nowit was bad enough that wendy became powerful far far too fast no i will not let it be excused because it was her destiny and she had the power within herbr br since when though did she learn healing no worstsince when could she resurrect people so shen is raised from the dead then wendy and he fight the guybr br he loses way to easily the worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time and he is banished forever then the monks commend wendy on her sacrificebr br two things 1 dont the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more finesse to it 2 what sacrifice the fact that she didnt go to homecoming because the girl did not break a sweat or even bleed i mean come on now this movie was tv pg i wanted to see somebody get hurtbr br ahhemmoving onbr br i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one based on my comments part of critique you must know though is breaking a thing down you dont necessarily try to look for the bad but if its there you bring attention to it this movie has a lot of bad but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first placebr br so i suppose it was all right not that me not saying it wasnt all right wouldve stopped anybody from watching it
