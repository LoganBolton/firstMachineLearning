i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last monthbr br i watched it and i have only a few comments about itbr br 1 terrible storyline 2 terrible acting 3 bad fightingscenesbr br i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously badbr br  the only positive thing about this movie in my opinion is nikki berwick god she looks nice in this moviebr br thats about it
