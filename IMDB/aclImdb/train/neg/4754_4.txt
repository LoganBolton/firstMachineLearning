i loved the original it was brilliant and always will be strangely though i actually looked forward to seeing the remake im usually a little bit against remakes because theres far too many of them but somehow this intrigued me i was really enjoying it to begin with caine brilliant as usual and jude law managing to hold is own next to him it was quite clever how it was modernised and it was working what stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes it goes completely away from the original so far in fact that is ceases to be clever and just gets annoying the end in the original was fantastic so much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever this it grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make caines character a homosexual it was if they were trying far to hard to be different and then bang laws dead roll credits this film is worth the watch simply for the performances but those last seven minutes really do drag it down what a pity
