a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie but doing nothing else nicely at allbr br a underparr performance from the actors law and caine diluted further by weak selfindulgent directionbr br the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a supermodern homesetting the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable is replaced with a horrid brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer but this is not the clever toing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word gobr br this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act
