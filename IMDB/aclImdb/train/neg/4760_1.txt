this reworking of anthony shaffers classic play did not last long in cinemas having recently suffered through it on cable i still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket director kenneth branagh writer harold pinter and starproducer jude law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes without the fun or class of the longer originalbr br michael caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film he now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead played in that version by laurence olivier both were nominated for best actor oscars but lost to marlon brando in the godfather looking puffy and washedout caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as batmans butler he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter whats next  alfie ii or son of the man who would be king br br but then no one benefits from this inane adaptation by pinter who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of shaffers witty character interplay branaghs direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldnt hold up in a secondrate nightclub neither the shadows nor the tight overacted closeups can help law overcome his dull screen persona the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller almost making you forget the purpose behind the titlebr br fans of the original stage production with anthony quayle and keith baxter and the oliviercaine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream the late mr shaffer who wrote the 1972 screenplay as well as hitchcocks frenzy and several agatha christie adaptations must be turning in his grave wishing he could plan a real murder or two
