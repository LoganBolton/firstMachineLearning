86 wasted minutes of my life i fell asleep the first time i attempted watching it and i must say im not one to ever fall asleep in the cinemabr br i have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner and can only surmise that the actors were as hardup as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itselfbr br everything in this dire adaptation is overacted and if it isnt the wooden acting almost as though you can see the teleprompter then the set itself which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways and overdressed to an unimaginable extent is enough to put you off the entire farcebr br as to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise any person who does not see that  as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot  telegraphed light years in advance should check their eyesight immediatelybr br bad acting and from two very decent actors coupled with the hypercoddled branagh trademark overdirection is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourselfbr br on top of it all there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this heightened towards the end of it all i can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shant try to emulate this level of cinema ever again
