i watched this movie as i liked the plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how theyre connectedbr br the setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie  although there wasnt much action the story moved at a relatively good pacebr br there was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering alpha males and it was a welcome surprise for me anywayto see melissa joan hart hasnt given up on acting yetbr br a few things let it down for me personally 1 the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodiesbr br 2 mjhs line about her cop ex getting her into this when in reality he was the least deserving person to be there he hadnt knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capturebr br 3 the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff hanger no obvious end it just endsbr br and for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating the first 2 points i would let slide but not the end
