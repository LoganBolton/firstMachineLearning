dont waste your time on this film it could have been good but the ending was one of the lamest ive ever seen i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film couldve looked at that final scene and thought yeah now theres an ending and patted themselves on the back about it to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist but instead just let the whole buildup fall flat on its face when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock  i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance seriously id really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room look them in the face and say  wtf
