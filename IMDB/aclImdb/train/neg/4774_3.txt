im not sure if the filmmakers were after a sawtype movie or 12 angry men people piecing together the facts to get at the truth whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth watchingbr br i dont watch movies for blood and gore but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more most were offcamera minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deathsbr br it also bugged me that the cop was among the victims he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence given to him by mjh into the evidence room and wouldnt mjh a the prosecuting attorney have had access to that evidencetaking it out and putting the wrong evidence backanyway so she wouldnt have needed the cops help the others while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming still played larger roles in his ultimate demise the gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent the insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need etc but the cops crime seemed minor in comparison since he didnt know exactly what he was doing the filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged mjh to plant the evidence which would have made him more culpable and mjhs yelling that he the cop got her in that mess doesnt make any sense at allbr br it would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why heshe was there and deserved to die the insurance guy for example could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them the oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness etc yes more violent that the gun deaths but more interestingbr br the dialog wasnt witty there were no twists and the ending was one of the worse if not the worst ive ever seen the ending along knocked three stars off my ratingbr br the actors did a decent job especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work withbr br overall a waste of time
