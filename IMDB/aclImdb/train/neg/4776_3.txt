i had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is sidney poitiers best movie poitier had just returned from over a decades break in film acting and he is clearly creaky here 11 of his films are mentioned in wikipedia and they dont include this 5 of his films are on the afis list of top 100 inspiring movies again not including this berenger and poitier rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to canada some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and berenger and poitiers bonding was cringeworthy and awkward not helped by a completely bland script kirstie alley as the hostage was underused and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen some attempt at suspense is made for example when youre meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer all of them are typecast villains i understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there i guessed who it was and i wasnt really trying hardbr br if youre a berenger fan watch the sniper 1993 you even get to see billy zane strutting his stuff its much better all in all id give shoot to kill 310 its not daring and its just too straightforward for me
