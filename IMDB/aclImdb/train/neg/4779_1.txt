in 2004 i liked it then it became very stupid it suggests that kids are brainless it insults children cartoon network used to be great one of the shows i liked was hamtaro it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming the show fosters home for imaginary friends is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your sprite it seems as if todays television producers are only interested in making money rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money lately my children are tuning in to the old shows 60s to find something interesting to watch perhaps in the absence of originality for television to look to its past and recycle childrens programing from days gone by
