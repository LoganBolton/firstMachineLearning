i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contractbr br she decided to take the money but her career suffered accordinglybr br that might explain what she was doing in comet over broadway though it doesnt explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it too ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and thats right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part logically leads to the next partbr br also the sets and costumes looked like bmovie stuff and her hair turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and youll be doing yourself a favor
