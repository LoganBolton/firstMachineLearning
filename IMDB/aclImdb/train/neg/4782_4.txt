1st watched 12242009  4 out of 10 dirrobert ellis miller emotional christmas fluff that doesnt really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factualbased incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make christmas happen for them the three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to washington dc to enlist the then president of the united states herbert hoover this trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer which makes the story kind of like a disney animals on the run movie and doesnt quite fit here at the ending there isnt any details given as to how the president helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie in my opinion the movie does eventually bring tears but it takes too long to get to this the movie isnt supposed to have been an original tv movieaccording to imdb but it has the obvious fadeouts that make it look this way  so im not sure their information is accurate all in all this is a simple moviethat could have been more complex with a happy christmaslike story but blandly played and without a lot of substance
