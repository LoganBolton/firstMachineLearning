so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that its hard to know where to beginbr br first of all its a remarkably unscary scary movie even by amercian standards the dialogue is clich√© the characters are twodimensional the writing is hohum and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interestingbr br we meet the following stereotypes in order balding loser guy probably divorced but who knows this movie doesnt tell us with a brave heart the young hero who doesnt do anything heroic at all brave little kid with a homicidal streak a mile wide and black badass bitch with more brawn than brains these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary reaper man and his evil ewoksbr br oh and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people given a chance they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doent have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them booh actually one of them is haunted by a good ghost but then again it might be a deceitful spectre who seems intent on helping our brave contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friendbr br there is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters it starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie but this doesnt explain a lot if youve seen the first two movies fine otherwise you dont know who these people are how they are related why they arent in school or at work or why you should care whether they live or die consequently you dont the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects and there arent enough of those to keep you awakebr br of potenial interestamusement are the three raider punks as stupid as they are evil who menace our heroes but they dont get much screen time they are offed almost immediately then they are buried why anybody should take the time is beyond me then they appear again as evil raider punk zombies only to be offed again literally within a minutebr br the rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of caspar the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing driving around looking for places and balding loser trying to score som bad black bitch booty using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager no dice there not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie so good thing there never is anybr br the head baddie called the tall man doesnt manage to scare anyone older than 3 years howling booooy every five minutes isnt enough why he with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upperbody strength doesnt simply squash our heroes like bugs isnt explained instead he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hellbr br filmgoers who like masterpieces like friday 13th part xxxxviii jason goes to college might find some entertainment the rest of us who have developed pubic hair will be bored out of our skulls
