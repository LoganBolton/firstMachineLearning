in the third entry of the phantasm series mike and reggie continue chasing the tall man assisted by a triggerhappy 9 year old a black gi jane and the spirit of mikes deceased brother he died in the original phantasm number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on reggies incompetence as a lover and his talent as standup comedian the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed which fits a story like this better also the settings arent as macabre here plus the constant presence of the tall man agnus schrim isnt as obvious there still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time by the way beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings offscreen the entire phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of don coscarelli who wrote and directed 4 episodes so farthe fifth being in production the first one is a semicult classic the second is a horrorfeast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped a michael baldwin returns as mike even though james legros portrayed his character a lot better in phantasm ii
