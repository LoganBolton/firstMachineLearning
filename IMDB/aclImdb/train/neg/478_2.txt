the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff ive only seen perhaps eight of them but comet over broadway is the worst so far the very best thing about it is that its short oh and the orrykelly gowns of course are fine james wong howes cinematography is not kay francis throughout looks fatfaced and far less attractive than she normally does minna gombell whom i dont know otherwise is good as a semitough burlesque dancer it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque the closing shot  kay francis and her child when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother did i doze off walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous the whole film is so cheap so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who dont know in warner bros cynical estimation of them that what theyre getting is garbage
