its been close to ten years since ive seen either of the last two sequels to phantasm  surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good that being acknowledged to this day im still a huge fan of the first two installments so i thought id go back and reexperience the final chapters part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesnt make much sense again kicking off right where the previous movie left us reggie saves mike from the tall man who vows to come back for him later but things arent safe for long when they come across jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere apparently his soul is held prisoner by the tall man so mike is then dragged into the sinister doublepronged netherworld and reg has to find him along the way he meets up with a ten yearold kid and a nunchuck wielding black chick named rocky who assist him throughout his journeybr br theres really nothing memorable about phantasm iii other than how stupid and forcefully humorous it tries to be only one positive aspect that didnt even help the movie and that was the return of a michael baldwin and bill thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic the problem is they pretty much make cameo appearances reggie banister is of course back in his starring role but his bumbling lovesick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like angus scrimm also just didnt seem entirely into his role he talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the quirkiness that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to most peoples opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think its still entertaining maybe im just too much of a nit picker but i just couldnt get into this one i remember disliking it when i was a kid and after rewatching it  i can safely say  nothing has changed don coscarelli rocked the scene with his original lowbudget nightmarish legendary film phantasm which i still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and gory but lord of the dead stupid title just looked too rushed and slapped together to me the inclusion of the two new characters tim and rocky the only thing missing was scrappy doo was a strong indication of coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchisebr br so its a phantasm movie with very little gore nudity and quadruplebarrel shot guns need i say more
