after mob boss vic moretti late great anthony franciosa kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with derek their new chauffeur vietnam vet and blames it on the poor guy derek finds himself in jail where he has to contend with a corrupt warden vics prisoner brother who runs the jail and oh yeah illegal experiments conducted by a shady cia agent great genremainstay and first time director john saxon to turn various prisoners into superhuman invincible zombies of course things get out of hand and its up to derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners to save the day after the infected ones take the jail overbr br john saxon is a great talented actor  as a director saxon is a great talented actor to say this movie johns sole directorial outing to date lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement however the film isnt totally without merit the dialog while idiotic is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes sadly this isnt really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into its own which is fairly late in the movie as such the most i can recommend this film is to say that if youre a fan of saxon which i indeed am its worth one watch just go in with low expectations and you should be finebr br eye candy dana lis mason and tane mcclure get toplessbr br my grade d
