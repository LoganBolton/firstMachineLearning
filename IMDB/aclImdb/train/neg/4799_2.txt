i myself am a big fan of lowbudget 80s horror films this isnt the worst but still not to spectacular the plot line is decent but drags out way too long youre through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action the kills arent very creative and the zombies arent too crafty i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick its watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life ill give the film credit for being somewhat original if you are really into b horror movies its worth a viewing but if youre not dont bother but you dont have to take my word for it
