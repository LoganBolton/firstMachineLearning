wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believablebr br the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town shes had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a bigtime actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about shenanigansas this actor is a cad so the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actorand the actor dies as a result hes convicted of first degree murder not manslaughter but murder 1 now pregnant and in need of funds kay goes to new york but broadway jobs arent to be found so shes forced to take any jobeven burlesque unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy but the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play despondent she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kidbut the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husbands lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10000 he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people how can 10000 get him out otherwisemaybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wowthis is enough for 2 or 3 films and all this occurs by the 45 minute mark believe it or not theres quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfoldsbr br this is sort of like kitchen sink writingthrowing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms francis best efforts its the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2ndrate plot its almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a diehard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not goodbr br by the way the child who plays francis daughter upon her return to new york sybil jason really was terrible i think she was supposed to bei think
