when a man who doesnt have alzheimers cant remember how many films hes made he probably is the worlds most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of socalled eurotrash his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the films title is misleading for starters as any other franco film ive seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while youre mostly waiting for them to end because theyre so very tediousbr br devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america theres lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoomins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoomins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are francos main methods of extending a film out to feature lengthbr br the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and its hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals sweet jesusbr br anyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklynamerican half englishliverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interestbr br not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out haha by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but its gotta be done at some point and its nice to note that the director will show anyones genitals on camerabr br the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of filmmaking but he doesnt muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseambr br ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if youre trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and youll be made as restless as i was if you like franco youll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are youll never come across this film copies of it arent just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it its franco lazy crazy franco
