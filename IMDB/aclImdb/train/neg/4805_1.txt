i loved adrianne curry before this show i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won i also liked chris knight he seems like a great guy but this show just made me sick im so angry at both of them for what happened on that show i dont care that they were different ages i know age cant stand between love but adrianne you had been together for only seven months it didnt surprise me at all that he hadnt proposed and i dont see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before theyre ready if its meant to be then why not just enjoy each others company and love each other and let it come naturally turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary its stupidly obvious that chris loves you with or without a ring and chris shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway youve been through two failed marriages how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit i hope the relationship lasts but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage
