2 stars for kay francis  shes wonderful and she didnt deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way br br the twopronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a smalltown wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a bigshot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband shes going to the movies the hubbys biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubbys ear that kays not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands facefirst in a pond lake and dies now heres the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based br br 1 the judge tells the jury that if its determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder whaaaaa i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most not first degree murder give me a break but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life whatever br br 2 the hubbys lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells kay that its all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadnt gone over to the actors room then her husband wouldnt have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that shes the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees what the hell the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first placebr br i cant even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the precode days youd never have caught kay playing such a wimp in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role this character was a far cry from precode kay roles and reallife spitfire kay francisbr br steer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there from personal experience i can highly recommend mary stevens md and jewel robbery also good are dr monica and one way passage im sure theres other great kay flicks as well but im only mentioning the ones ive seen and can recommend
