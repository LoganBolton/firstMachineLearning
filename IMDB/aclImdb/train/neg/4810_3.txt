for starters and for the record the term necromancy describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does not in any way relate to having sex with cadavers that is called necrophilia and yes i know its an obvious difference but im already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that i sport a perverted taste in movies this movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy in fact and merely just qualifies as boring inept and terribly bad necromancy makes at least one top five ranking namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made now director bert i gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces on his repertoire there are titles like earth vs the spider king dinosaur and food of the gods but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead lori and her husband frank move to the quiet little town of lillith where frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity especially with the towns patriarch and owner mr cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious thats another thing how can anybody own a town and everybody in it either way lori gradually discovers that everybody in lillith is a witch and mr cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead since many years already cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and hes prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes i honestly dont see the point of the whole movie its a blatant ripoff of rosemarys baby  one of the alternate titles even is rosemarys disciples  but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief why isnt anyone allowed to have children for as long as catos son remains dead thats just really selfish when where and how did lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead necromancy definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget the grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy orson welles performance  undoubtedly the low point of his career  is pitiable and still its the best aspect about the entire movie
