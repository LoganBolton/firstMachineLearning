i watched the canadian videotape of this movie as the witching which somehow made its way to new york state audio was quite bad i had to raise it to about 78 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog orson welles was a mumbler worse than usual and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber a ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted some closed captions would really have helpedbr br a group of witches or satanists the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll the woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named lilith where hes been offered a job at a toy factory despite one of the akas of this movie apparently being the toy factory we never see it and its only occasionally referred to at allbr br on the way to lilith her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss mr cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion he drives aggressively and causes another car to go off the road and blow up after the police arrive she takes a doll that fell out of the car the second of many handmade dolls in the moviebr br it turns out mr cato and all the townspeople are witches and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage though she doesnt realize it they want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy of which she was not really awarebr br some images in the movie have some impact but on the whole the movie is not very involving the movie does seem a bit of a mess and this is no doubt largely due to its re editing and the addition of new footage the original version according to the end credits was called necromancy  a life for a life the magic of dvd could let us see both versions on one disc but rereleasing this movie probably isnt a priority
