i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for its own good the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanistswitches in a small town and a young womans attempt to escape them the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences by the finale there are too many unanswered questions whats worse as the story is so confusing its pretty hard to root for any of the characters it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesnt have that much to do maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie now that would really be fun
