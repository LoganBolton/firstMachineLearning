ive given up trying to figure out what version of this im watching the copyright at the end indicates 1983 and though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film i will say that watching a film obviously made in the aquarian age including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling extremely unsettlingbr br my main objection here is how dare the filmmakers bury cuteasabutton pamela franklin alive how dare theybr br seriously shes all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies ive seen her in  this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house  they kill her offbr br i would like to put the film industry on notice pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outsidebr br no one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it i am quite cross the fury has been unleashedbr br for bmovie fans seeking out a crapfest you could do much worse than this on the plus side this is not a film which involves satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way  this movie is a hardcore satanic filmbr br walltowall satanic ceremonies baphomets hallucinations a ludicrous rat attack  what else could you ask forbr br this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling graftedon 1980s synth soundtrack which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be the soundtrack reminded me of something youd hear on the equalizer its really badbr br also they made pamela franklin squash her charming english accent which was also quite rude if not a cruel atrocity against the viewer such as you might find covered by the universal declaration of human rights i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice whos with me i could forgive everything else about this film if they didnt abuse pamela franklin and so i throw the gauntlet down sirs  anyone who messes with pamela franklin messes with mebr br even in a fictional contextbr br good day sirs
