the only previous gordon film i had watched was the kiddie adventure the magic sword 1962 though i followed this soon after with empire of the ants 1977 he seems to be best remembered however for his scifi work of the 1950sbr br anyway i happened upon this one in a dvd rental shop hadnt i noticed orson welles unmistakable figure on the sleeve i probably wouldnt even have bothered with it – since i know the film under its original title necromancy id seen a still from it on an old horror tome of my fathers the actors presence in a film about diabolism seemed like a great idea which couldnt possibly miss but the end result – particularly in this bastardized edition – is a disaster i honestly felt sorry for welles who looks bored and rather than in his deep and commanding voice he mutters the inane demonic invocations almost in whispers br br the plot is basically yet another retread of rosemarys baby 1968 a couple is invited to a remote community under false pretenses and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by diabolists the girl played by pamela franklin ostensibly has supernatural powers passed on from her mother who appears intermittently throughout to warn her – though as delivered in an intense manner through clenched teeth the latters speeches end up being largely incoherent and the fount of immense hilarity every time she appears and is expected to revive welles deceased young son from the dead for what its worth franklin – a genre regular right down from her debut performance in the innocents 1961 – isnt bad in her role which requires some nudity and experiences several semieerie hallucinations during the course of the film hubby michael ontkean however isnt up to the challenge of his john cassaveteslike character some of the other girls look good as well – notably lee purcell whose belated decision to help franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her undoingbr br events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax which sees the satanists ultimately turning on franklin and have her take the revived boys place in the coffin thats gratitude for you while the added scenes do stick out the hilarious opening ceremony and other wouldbe erotic embellishments the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them then again this particular version is further sunk by the tackedon electronic score – which is wholly inappropriate and cheesy in the extreme
