any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesnt bother with an actual story its annoying those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first and the story simply tacked on for this reason we often talk of the story jumping through hoops as it twists about trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashionbr br the story in comet over broadway doesnt just jump through hoops its a three ring circus its so ludicrous so illconceived so disingenuous that if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen you will be carrying on quite a rant before its throughbr br the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession since its all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion so in the end theres no point to the story the theme becomes irrelevant and as is often the case with poor screenplays the acting doesnt save a thing
