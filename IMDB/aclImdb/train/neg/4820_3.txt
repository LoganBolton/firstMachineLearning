as a teenager i was pretty into the whole bigfoot thing  i read the books and followed the reported sightings as a more jaded adult ive largely given up on the big guy now but dont mind watching the odd movie when i come across one this one had a few strong points to it  mainly the recreations of two of the more famous bigfoot encounters  the ape canyon incident of 1924 and the bauman incident of c1850 as related to and by teddy roosevelt both of which im somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading i did the movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations but the recreations were well done theres also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous patterson video again taking for granted its authenticity the sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men unfortunately in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a halfbr br its the fictional story done in a documentary style of an expedition to a remote area of northern british columbia to the suspected home range of the sasquatch a computer had targeted this area based on sightings and  in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie  the computer also used eyewitness sightings to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the creature of the patterson video aside from those 20 minutes i mentioned we basically watch this expedition travel which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip ive been on camping trips with the guys let me tell you  theyve never been worthy of a movie interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots although one suspects that canned footage was used or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals and there are some spectacular scenery shots except that the scenery isnt of northern british columbia its from national parks in oregonbr br i did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch so we didnt have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this 310
