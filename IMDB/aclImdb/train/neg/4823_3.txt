lame plot and twodimensional script made characters look like cardboard cutouts needless to say this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters especially the fiancé he looked and acted more like a cartoon in summary i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama it uses just about every cliché in the book the tortured classical musician who wants to breakout and play salsa the freespirited fiancée engaged to a bean counter personality she doesnt love i wont list them or else it would be a spoiler because id be giving away the whole plot the dancing was ok but nothing special ive seen worse 3 stars for good music the band was really tight i saw it on youtube thankfully i didnt pay good money to see it at a theater im still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished
