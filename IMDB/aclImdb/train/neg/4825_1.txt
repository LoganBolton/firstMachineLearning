judging by the hype and other reviews on this site i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies what i got was complete crap focusing on junkies i wonder if theres another movie called cookers that these people reviewed there are only 3 main characters and none of them struck me as wellwritten or wellacted basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addictsbr br do yourself a favor dont rent this movie rent cabin fever or some other decent horror movie hell rent mary poppins the animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything youll find in cookers
