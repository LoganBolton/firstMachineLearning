i see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark the main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it the camera work ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which i could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasnt the sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well i see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but dont expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything keep your expectations low and youll get more out of it at least it was only an hour and a half oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me but im a movie snob so take that for what thats worth
