as an ordinary moviewatcher i cant say i enjoyed watching this one its not too emotional for a drama not too gripping for a thriller not too fast for an action plus some moments of the movie are hardly credible ok i understand soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there but its hard to believe that a person would risk his life carjack into the middle of a hostile city and after being shouted at by a professors wife run away without having asked a question in a proper way it would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so but its supposed to be a serious film about war there are several episodes like this so the whole picture makes an impression that its just a raw preview of a movie and it needs considerable workbr br it feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier but all these curves of his psychology seem simply unnaturalbr br this picture left a question in my head why why they gave it an oscar why six and imho its the most thrilling part of the movie
