really really i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage horrible in every sense terribly inaccurate in so many ways i have an easier time believing the president of the united states suiting up flying a jet fighter and shooting down aliens it is easier to note the few things that were right my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years it was overacted seemingly pointless plot diversions and had questionable cinematography at timesbr br xbox youtube acupat utilitiesÂ… did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004 its not like you had to do extensive research it was only five years before this movie came out i am an iraq war veteran and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or an eod squad you would realize how bs this movie is to compare this to platoon or saving private ryan is ludicrous why dont you just throw commando and red dawn in there too i think those might be more accurate br br if for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot the historical and factual discrepancies then this movie might just be ok nothing more if you keep on hearing oscar buzz and have to add your own pompous review go right ahead as for me i am writing the director to see if i can get my 131 minutes back
