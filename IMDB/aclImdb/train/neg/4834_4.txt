i was looking forward to kathryn bigelows movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 oscars which it was awarded unfortunately it really isnt a good movie the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard the actors put in a good effort but for me i didnt really get what the movie was trying to be its not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket not as epic as band of brothers not as action packed aswell anything i certainly cant see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are hyping it up to these epic proportions mind you given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years i suppose theres not a lot to choose from
