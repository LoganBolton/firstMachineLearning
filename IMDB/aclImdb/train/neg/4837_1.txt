i went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about and i was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6 oscars and 79 rating on imdb as of todaybr br kathryn bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and i wonder why did the totally unrealistic cowboy bomb disposalman storyline mean anything to somebody that i failed see why did i keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movie about a cowboy doing brave deeds in the wild wild west infected with evil red indians but just that it was set in a different background this time was it given the oscars because the director being ex of james cameron and made it a nice underdog gossipy story for day time tv shows to munch on or was it some sort of emperors clothes syndrome  where most people realized it was junk but just couldnt say so because others didnt seem to be saying it out aloudbr br and finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in highresolutionsuperslowmo as if to convey a deep message or something something in the lines of eod guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason and you can get the oscars for editing and directing for thatbr br if you havent seen this yet dont waste your money on tickets wait till they run it on tv in a few years you are not going to miss much
