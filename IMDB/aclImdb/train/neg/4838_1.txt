i decided to watch this one because its been nominated for oscar this year i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and disappointed first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really annoyingbr br i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is thisbr br american military machine people who makes money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something sort of patrioticbr br why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of lovingwarlikeadrug oh please come on what a bore br br watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall
