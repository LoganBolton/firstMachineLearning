 and being let down bigger than ever before i wont make any direct references or anything here but to say the least this film is pathetic if youre military trained dont bother watching i put it on the dvd with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action  war flick why couldnt i just have read the reviews firstbr br already at the first bomb scene the film has huge glitches and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger my 2 friends not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmakers mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on were realistic well as you might have guessed theyre not  at allbr br avoid this movie unless youre able to overlook these completely idiotic and reoccurring mistakes being made 210 for catching my interest at first
