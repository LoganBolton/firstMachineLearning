i love a good war film and i fall into the been there done that category so i would like to think my review is an accurate one imho having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish there is no way i can recommend this film to youbr br it started off with me shouting at the tv saying you wouldnt do that etcbut i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so i chilled a bit but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dudi was rightbr br there simply wasnt any logic to the eod scenes i just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger so much so i was left scratching my head all the time then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert one of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some sas wannabe contractorsbr br the sniper scene was just so laughable it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patienceit started with the contact right and went down hill fast if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the eod team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all you are just left watching and asking why hasnt it ended yetbr br then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laughanother scene where you just wanted it to end it added nothing to the filmbr br then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched it defied all logic and ability to write a good storylineit was senseless and awful i still dont understand why they wasted time on it then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter pure comedy br br the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be i thought it was going to be stupid illogical eod scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death all i wanted was for it to end it was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid senseless actionish scenesbr br there is no way i can recommend this maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesnt make sense the only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high imdb ratingwhich must be the 247 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good sorry folksit just aintbr br not recommendedit will just bore you
