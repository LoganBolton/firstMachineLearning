i just rented this todayheard lots of good reviews beforehand wow what a pile of steaming poo this movie is does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollars back finally someone bumped stoploss from the worst iraq war movie ever number one spot to be fair i dont think there are any good iraq war movies anyway but this was really bad br br i wont get into any technical inaccuracies theres a hundred reviews from other gwot vets that detail them all if the director bothered to consult even the lowliest enothing about technical accuracy however they couldve made the movie somewhat realisticmaybe i guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film he or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was was there a message seriously thoughwtfbr br im pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really this film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow to say the least and the acting is poor at best its ironic i suppose that this movie is supposed to be about explosive ordinance disposal because its the biggest bomb ive seen this year
