i was disgusted by this movie no it wasnt because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did judith beheading holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trialbr br i dont know if you understood this from the movie probably not tassi was not a noble character he raped artemisia it was not love it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again its truebr br i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art workbr br dont see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia
