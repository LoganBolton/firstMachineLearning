watch a team of bomb disposal experts in iraq count down their time before they can go homebr br that in itself sounds boring every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go homebr br i must be missing something im a great fan of war films if they are done well this had jarhead syndrome a film that at times was beautifully shot but cinematography doesnt stop it from being totally dull and pointlessbr br and get over the slow mo cartridges coming out of the gun shot already they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in itbr br i didnt have any empathy for the main guy in it i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die in fact the film would have worked much better if he hadbr br i read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it and everyone else loved it i have never been in the forces and im with them its pretentious drivel the 3 stars are for the cinematography
