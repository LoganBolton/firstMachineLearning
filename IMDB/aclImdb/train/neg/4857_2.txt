i really liked zb1 really i did i have no problem with extremely lowbudget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 if you can imagine such a thing check out wiseguys vs zombies if youre interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are aboutbr br but zb3 was just so bad it was retarded i dont want to bother being dignified in my criticism i want my 90 minutes back etc except that it really only took 80 minutes because partway through i put it into 14x fast forwardbr br okay heres some criticismbr br 1 the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of fbombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1s 70 minutes but there were actually fewer events in zb3 its all talkingbr br 2 the gore effects got stupider just glop rubbed around on peoples tummiesbr br 3 despite the epic exposition there really wasnt a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i wont spoil it if youre going to watch it dont watch it but then its just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for 80 minutes or fewer if you so choose
