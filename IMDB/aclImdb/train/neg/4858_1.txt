why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie the first two zombie bloodbath movies were stupid enough but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy perhaps of all time todd sheets is still the director but no longer the screenwriter which isnt a negative or a positive considering hes just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one the writing is too heavily reliant on the fword which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at nausea the acting is about on par with the last two bloodbath movies so naturally its some of the worst ive ever seen the special effects are better than the last 2 but they still look godawful the plot has become too complicated for its own good and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel leading to one of the most idiotic endings ive ever seen after the movie it goes to outtakes which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake only see this to make fun of it because if you go into this with a serious mind you might possibly kill yourselfbr br my rating bomb 95 mins
