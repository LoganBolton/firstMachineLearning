just what we need another remake of vintage hollywood cinema with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor 1996 this shows why were running out of special ideas in making a quality movie ladies and gentlemen it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans things can only get more worse unfortunately bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of family funfare instantly even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater sad to say this is the more progressive premillennium era but enjoy it while it lasts cause things can only get worse with time more went wrong with the allnew dr dolittle it is absolutely plotless feeling too flat i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock we need more talented voiceovers than a bunch of overpaid celebs who dont want to declare bankruptcy ill have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998 then again the original version wasnt any good either murphys next project could be patton if hes not careful
