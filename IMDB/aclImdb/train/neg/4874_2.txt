too bad neither the animals or eddie murphy had anything to say worth saying this movie is just blandbr br childrens movie well if youre trying to get them to take a nap then maybe its just 90 minutes of some eyewrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that arent funny and the lipsyncing makes the old godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison meanwhile eddie pluto nash murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience apparently hes trying to modify his old manic persona but to what in short all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this reimagining or whatever it is a town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff no really and pluto nash can psychobabble with them things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprisesbr br rent the 67 movie or some old yogi bear cartoons
