if you want to make a movie like this have the threat be real dont surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos there is no credibility here the plot is dull and unbelievable the acting is even worse i thought that i was watching arthur lake dagwood who is one of the worst actors in history when i saw the main character oh well at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad i dont care do you there are all these long scenes set in this austere office the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite people talk and smoke and dont do anything most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that its over dont bother
