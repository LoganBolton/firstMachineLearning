is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture the premise is not too bad  a naive front man for an illegal business  but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not workbr br was this considered a good b in 1942 hard to imagine the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast which contains several wellknown faces from the 30s and 40s such as warren hymer vince barnett and robert armstrong i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in lives of a bengal lancer so i wasnt counting himbr br cant recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3  if you have a choice get a root canal
