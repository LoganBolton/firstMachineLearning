criminally insane 2 is included on the new dvd of satans black weddingcriminally insane and its a good thing too because when ive seen a movie and know theres a sequel especially something thats as obscure as this im always curious ive now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again most of ci2 is nothing but flashbacks to ci and footage of ethel asleep recalling fond memories i guess thanks to proposition 13 shes released from napa state wonder if she got to see the cramps play while she was there and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that ethel promptly takes to calling granny this is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic and its even complete with a couple of rolls of course ethel does her thing which is to dispatch anyone between her and food especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert also you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink guess thats all a matter of misguided trust if you liked or disliked criminally insane either way theres no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity one wonders why the makers of this even bothered 2 out of 10
