the line is funnier in england where away from vixens native america the word fanny has a whole new meaning sadly its the only laugh youll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funnybr br oddly unalluring with paintedon eyebrows erica gavin acting ability zero is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons as if in revenge he asks her if she would go with a shetland pony reference is also made to making it with monkeys gavins ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in its lack of appeal by her seduction dance  which involves a bonfire and a haddock personally i preferred the haddockbr br for 68 this was pretty tame stuff and belies the controversy it attracted at the time a character claims to be getting stoned though its only on bourbon and for one of the original x certificates theres no full frontal nudity just six years later we would be getting timmy lea and his confessions but here we have to make do with topless shots only gavins final seduction of her own brother really shocks another activity for vixen is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both the two women clearly arent enjoying acting out their scene together and make a poor effort to disguise it after vixen irons out their disharmony the romantic husband concludes of his wife i guess shes got it coming to herbr br the only nearworthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of cuban communism it seems out of place with the rest of the film though is spliced with shots of gavins breasts to rope it in to continuity this then leads into a vague antivietnam stance which is commendable though dropped in the middle of such a frivolous film it seems trite and insensitive not to say downright tasteless incidentally the part of wouldbe communist niles brooke is taken by harrison page the same harrison page who played captain trunk in amusing comedy sledge hammer page must be embarrassed by his back catalogue which also includes meyers beyond the valley of the dolls though meyer apologists would have you believe the terrible dialogue lousy acting sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm but wholly intentional as a defence it fails to hold waterbr br the irritating incidental music  a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and muzak used by tv stations when the transmission breaks down  is omnipresent and intrusive while even the silly amateurishly skewed camera angles cant generate interest a wonderful world of jazz saxophones where women have been asking for it black men  or shines  arent good enough for anyone and rape is an acceptable form of revenge absolutely abysmal
