an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe theyve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that theyve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but its simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version its hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if theyd favored the rest of the film with same brevity
