a movie about vixen erica gavin who has a mountie husband who she lovesbut she loves sex too in the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bedincluding her husband and brother also theres a tame lesbian sequencebr br this film put russ meyer on the map and was i believe the first critically acclaimed x rated film ever it was a big hit when it came out unfortunately it doesnt date wellbr br it is welldirected and erica gavin is just great whatever happened to her and it was very colorfulbut by todays standards its extremely tame im surprised it has an nc17 rating nowtheres no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all also its sadly pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing and pretty silly it is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968 purportedly i saw the cut version which has an r rating but ive heard only a few seconds here and there are missing br br meyers next film beyond the valley of the dolls is much better and dates very well catch that instead
