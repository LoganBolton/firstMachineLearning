the movie is actually too slow there are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more it may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isnt fun at all though you laugh several times but its really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun to disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie videoclips into the movie they are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50s but its hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that its really sad several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and thats it beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost personally i cannot recommend the movie i believe that art is something that shouldnt be boring during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review
