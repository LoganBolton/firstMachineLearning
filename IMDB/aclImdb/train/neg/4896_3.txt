ill start with what i likedbr br i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good   choreography everythingbr br i loved the crab scene and the cooking scenebr br but thats about itbr br i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much pornlike scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no waybr br 3 stars for the songs
