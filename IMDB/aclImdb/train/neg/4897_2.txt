this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai mingliang for me it oozes laziness from its every frame so im not going to analyse it thoroughly either but some observationsbr br 1 if the premise is drought why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy and watermelon the trivial substitute sex or it is only a matter of lousy filmmaking not giving a damn about being coherentbr br 2 we dont get to know what had happened to the porn actress why she is unconscious or presumably dead it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully bombastically delivered but in retrospect her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed inbr br 3 nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadnt expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actorsbr br 4 the musical numbers recycled from the hole felt like a secondaryschoolers idea of artistic counterpointing executed on that very secondaryschool level of skill if that was the point the point sucked
