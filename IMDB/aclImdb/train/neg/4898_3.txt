the wayward cloud is a frustrating film to watch infuriatingly enigmatic it treats each shot like a work of art you get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were cranked out in the nineteenth century and mimicking their construction the camera here hardly ever moves  apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken this curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that even as the story progresses at a snaillike pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed unfortunately for me at least this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark i began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of willsbr br had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to western audiences as it is theres an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious or possibly dead woman that is so repugnant that while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women the users and the used it is so overzealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fastforward button of the remotebr br for all its problems the film is definitely a stayer and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make ironically for a film in which so little happens the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time for me however once was enough
