almost in the same league as yonfans rather atrocious color blossoms spider lillies drives the point home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge or much in the way of cutting its a taiwanese film which in this day and age is becoming a novelty at an alarming pace but more than that tidbit we can find very little in the way of the noteworthy herebr br you should know that ostensibly spider lillies is also a lesbianthemed story but in every aspect this is nothing but a plastic ploy to lure in the easily seduced and gullible in several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent taiwan release eternal summer then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment now we have the same thing with women zero chou presents for your nonexistent edification a tale likely to titillate at most a fifteen year old they managed some of the art house stance but in the end this results in a most inane simply uninteresting foraybr br the hong kong angle comes in the form of isabella leung bug me not isabella diary here sporting her most butch look yet although somewhat likable in her previous jobs isabella in spider lillies is listless and lacking in most departments either her heart wasnt into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch didnt quite appeal to her sensibilitiesbr br she does a taipei tattoo artist whos shy reclusive and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother played by john shen who thankfully grants the movie its only thespianrelated redeeming feature isabellas character oddly named takeko but supposedly hailing from hong kong soon hooks up with disaffected youth jade rainie yang from fondlyrecalled meteor garden the latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by her parents and life in general sure the grandmother component works well and is touching but otherwise jade as a protagonist is just as unmoving as her counterpart takekobr br the two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered angst with jade working as a webcam girl while takeko keeps her fathers legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm jade also wants to acquire this very design which leads to takeko exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal discourse with the spunky jadebr br well if theres little discourse to write the homebase about is at least the intercourse memorable in a word no they kiss and feign doing the nasty close to the end but just as eternal summer reminded us not long ago theres a gulf measured in lightyears between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think theyre about to see sexual contentbr br this cynical expectationbuilding seals spider lillies fate with a weak story hohum acting and an overall dearth of relics to take away from the theater with you this one kind of makes color blossoms look good come to think of it at least there we got a bit of teresa cheungs mammaries no spider lillies is no av masterpiece and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid glb movie festivalbr br amazingly for a pseudoindie release not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration thats just as well since it makes passing on spider lillies much easier believe you us avoid it and you wont be missing out on anything goodbr br rating
