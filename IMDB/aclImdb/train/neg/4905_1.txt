i am usually disappointed by network movies even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people however this one is the worst of the worst the screenplay is weak and the acting especially that of tracey pollan is abominable ive trudged off to see my kidshigh school plays and been treated to better acting pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks when she tries to express fear anger or grief its extremely hollow because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment scary things wont scare you sad things wont make you sad romance wont make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive first to die says a lot about this movie
