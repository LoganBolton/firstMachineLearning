spoilers throughoutbr br i had read the book 1st to die and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so i watched it for the most part it did there were some minor differenceslocation of the last violent scene for instance but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most moviesbr br this may have been a mistakealthough the movie was perfectly castwith pollen and bellows especiallyi was not that impressed with the book or let me take that back i started off very impressed gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped no difference with the movie here is whybr br there is no payoff in the book or the movie rarely have i read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with its final resolution and i had hoped the movie would vary a littlebr br the wholehe did it no she did it no they both did itwas not interesting not fascinating and more confusing annoying and depressing then anything else add to that that the love of lindsays life dies at the endafter her disease cleares and she cries at his grave and then cut to where shes contemplating suicidethen all of a sudden shes in a fight for her life with the real villain who was cleared after being arrested but it turns out he and the wife were in it togetherhello this whole thing has now become general hospital instead of a good old fashioned thriller i felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the moviei must admit it held my attention nicely the acting was very good for a tv moviewas hoping it wouldnt follow the book which it wound up doingbr br i still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the bookor maybe its just that i knew what would happenbut i have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all
