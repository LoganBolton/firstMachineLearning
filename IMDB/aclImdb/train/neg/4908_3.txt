this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle the why is porteau cove provincial park shown provincial parks are in canada and not the united states the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with stylus to read that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced we learn halfway into the movie that this woman works in the district attorneys office then in the correctional center a guard actually precedes jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender this would never happen in a real correctional setting the director really messed on this one  this doesnt happen in real life the acting is adequate the plot is good the cinematography is good however the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote
