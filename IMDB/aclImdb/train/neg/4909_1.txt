thats right you heard me i am a huge fan of james patterson i own 10 of his books and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion the screenwriter should be shot br br what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered then michael ohara has proved me wrong br br i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice to michael ohara and russell mulcahy dont quit your day job
