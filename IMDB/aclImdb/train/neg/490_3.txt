artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you cant paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkablebr br the story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just cant stop thinking of men and their bodiesÂ… for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal erupts funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a softporn fantasy i mean was artemesia that much of a manhungry person also its quite funny when shes insisting that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she seesbr br actually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasnt too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldnt fall for i woulda gone for the young fisherman p
