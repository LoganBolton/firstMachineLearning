having not read the novel i cant tell how faithful this film is the story is typical mystery material killer targets newlyweds woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease yes it sounds like a soap opera and thats exactly how it plays the first 23 are dull save for the murders and the last 13 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusionbr br acting is strictly sub par though its hard to blame the actors alone the screenplay is atrocious during the last 13 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting but thats only the last 13 director russell mulcahy is very much in his element but theres only so much he can do with a tv budget and the network censors on his back hes pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses though he managed to squeeze in a couple under the floor shots during the murders in the club restroom unfortunately as this is made for tv the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found note to producers give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire himbr br summing it up this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by tv standardswatch csi instead if youre in the mood for a film like this ive some excellent suggestions pick up a copy of dario argentos deep redmy highest recommendation superb film opera or even tenebre theyre stronger in every category
