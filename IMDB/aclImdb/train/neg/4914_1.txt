i love a good sappy love story and im a guy but when i rented love story i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraws characterbr br ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldnt help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care if she didnt die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce courtbr br people love this movie but its one of the worst of the 70s
