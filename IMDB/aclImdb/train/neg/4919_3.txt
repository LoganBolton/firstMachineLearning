ive rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraws in this movie god is she bothersome or what she says everything in the same tone and is horrible so horrible in fact that by contrast ryan oneal is brilliant br br there is not much of a story hes rich shes wooden they both have to sacrifice a lot for love his father is stonewall jackson hers is called by his first name in case you didnt notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love br br the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year john marley is fine as woodens father but a supporting nomination at least ali didnt win br br i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer but then again if it were up to me katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies shes certainly a better actress than mcgraw br br i didnt even cry when she got sick never occured to me to even feel sad br br it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15 and the score is good but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long and the sin of that is its not that old but it feels it
