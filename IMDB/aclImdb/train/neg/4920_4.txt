a very slick modern keeping it sensually hip revamp on the dracula story although staying with the traditional customs with quite an interesting if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through before losing interest again it gets off to a good start especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsings daughter a great place to set it but never took advantage of its settings despite etching a paradise in damn where dracula could flourish produced by wes carven and yeah they throw that name out there but written  directed by patrick lussier artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts dont help the messy script does get considerably silly lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy inserting a lot of blood the makeup is suitably achieved and a lot of virgin advertising no i dont mean virgins its the music company as it does get in numerous shots and helsings daughter works there too oh that wasnt obvious planting the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes now the performances are all over the shop but there are few familiar faces to spot danny masterson sean patrick thomas nathan fillion shane west and lochlyn munro gerard butler as dracula just didnt come off as not much of a presence was formed he was simply outshined by the succulent ladies of the night jennifer esposito colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as draculas brides the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role
