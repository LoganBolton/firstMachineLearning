dracula 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on sky movies in britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year i have absolutely no idea how i managed to miss it until its first broadcast on network television tonight  actually seeing as im not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe  my theory was proved right for the most part br br  minor spoilers br br what makes dracula 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved  for example early in the film the bad guys are flying draculas coffin from london to america  in a twin engine turbo prop plane   and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where dracula comes to life  a fight breaks out  theres lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit dont hear a sound until the script demands it  it also appears in this segments climax that dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses  sloppy scripting  and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where theres numerous scenes of characters being at the new orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then theyre back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced br br theres something else that yanked my chain  product placement  theres umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record labelretailer chain is in full view  i wont dare publicise the company brand  except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in britain  but i was under the impression this type of advertising was against british broadcasting guidlines and im surprised the bbc showed this movie if thats the case br br there are some positives in dracula 2000 like the visuals for example  this is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot  but its something we should expect from hollywood over the last few years  a very good looking movie thats very dumb
