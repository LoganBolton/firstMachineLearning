this film is really bad it maybe harsh but it is it really is poor script every vampire clich√© in the book is used and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character  ie ole dracula there have been some truly brilliant draculavampire movies in the past but this doesnt even make it into the dire slotbr br take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teenslasher move add a dribble of dracula lore and mix in a heady tonic of religioussurreal daydreaming  and you get a confusing mess of a film  dracula 2000br br i really cannot find any good things to say about this movie as if it wasnt bad enough that it was made in the first place they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent  whats the problem with that i hear you cry  well he is english but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accentbr br all in all you may as well say your money if you were thinking of buying it or rent it out watch it and discover for yourself why its about as scary as the tellytubbiesbr br ps although la la is pretty frightening
