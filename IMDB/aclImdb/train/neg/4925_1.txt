please dont waste your time this movie rehashes the worst of bram stokers dracula van helsing anne rices vampire lestat rock music and silly biblical references and blade hightech toys i really like vampire movies and novels and there are many out there that are very good  but not this stinker not even the soundtrack helps it mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the kickass metal some reported only a few times did i hear any metal mostly it was tortured violins avoid it like garlic and crucifixes
