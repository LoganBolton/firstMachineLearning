this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day a wealthy upper class english woman schemes plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly antisocial kind theres a clever sexrole reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters but naturally theres a tall dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right manbr br the wishywashy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme but those who thirst for romance will overlook that
