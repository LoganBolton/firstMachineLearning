silent night deadly night 5 is the very last of the series and like part 4 its unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that its a christmasthemed horror flickbr br except to the oblivious theres some obvious things going on heremickey rooney plays a toymaker named joe petto and his creepy sons name is pino ring a bell anyone now a little boy named derek heard a knock at the door one evening and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him even though it said dont open till christmas he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad who scolds him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself inside is a little red ball that sprouts santa arms and a head and proceeds to kill dad oops maybe he should have left wellenough alone of course derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs but he doesnt grow up to be some killer santa he just stops talkingbr br theres a mysterious stranger lurking around who seems very interested in the toys that joe petto makes we even see him buying a bunch when dereks mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma and what exactly is this guy doing well were not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick he does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a larry the larvae toy for his kid but of course larry is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course well things arent prettybr br anyway eventually whats going on with joe petto and pino is of course revealed and as with the old story pino is not a real boy pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from kenitalia a smooth plastic crotch so that could account for his evil ways and the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too and theres even kind of a happy ending of sorts wheebr br a step up from part 4 but not much of one again brian yuzna is involved and screaming mad george so some decent special effects but not enough to make this great a few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too like clint howard and neith hunter but that doesnt really make any difference anyway i now have seeing the whole series out of my system now if i could get some of it out of my brain 4 out of 5
