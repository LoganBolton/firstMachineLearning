this movie wasnt that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original its directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame the acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting thats one thing i like about screaming mad george make up effects artist for the film his effects are so offthewall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy theyre gonna get the movie isnt really all that gory but there is an extremely nasty eyeballmunching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot what mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasnt too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time possibly if you liked the weirdo 4th installment my favorite of all 5 youll probably like this one i liked it better than the matrix enjoy
