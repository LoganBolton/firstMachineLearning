cavemen exceeded my expectations and not in a good way it was even worse than i thought it would be basically heres the show the cavemen are an alternate race they face prejudice etc quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created almost being worthy of jail time for the writers one show featured the cavemen going into a club trying to pick up girls and then nothing else happened it was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute andy rooney dialog followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals for those who have not seen this show heres an example of the dialog youre sure youre okay with going out with a caveman yeah thats fine ive had like 10  thousand hilarious possibly the best writing ive ever witnessedbr br 22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup tackling tough social issues sounds like an entertaining night i also love how bad the recent ideas are that theyre resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials i wonder if theyll do the gecko next so that i can have a new title for the worst show ive ever seen i would even say that this is worse than viva laughlin at least viva laughlin was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspiredbr br shows like this make me hope that theres a comet up there somewhere aimed for earthbr br unratable honestly
