every new fall lineup show deserves at least my 3 strikes and youre out policy i give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh that is 3 complete episodes after episode 1 i actually said to the tvcancelled tomorrow it was that bad i have now watched the first 4 episodes of cavemen and have yet to manage even a smirk not a titter a guffaw a chortle as a matter of fact no facial movement at all i will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because i am convinced that i am clearly missing something in this show im simply not getting it but i believe that a comedy on a major tv network in primetime just has to be funny but there are no laughs from me yet theres just no way that abc would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 800 pm i know there has got to be an inside joke that just isnt jiving with my brain ive read each of the previous comments i get the social aspect of it but where are the jokes  i shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week until i have a lightbulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting eureka
