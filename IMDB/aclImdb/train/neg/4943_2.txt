i have watched 3 episodes of caveman and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better br br to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials with no real humor as we sat around watching these shows we all speculated on what was going to happenbr br the episode of the woman cavewoman with a attitude was actually a big yea right for us shes crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers and truth be told she needed a slapbr br i consider myself a pretty good reviewer taking in everything but i must say cavemen is comparable to the old show my mother the car i give it a 2 only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it
