sure this one isnt really a blockbuster nor does it target such a position dieter is the first name of a quite popular german musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about it is based on the autobiography dieter bohlen wrote a few years ago but isnt meant to be accurate on that the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for american standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb  it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a bohlenfan or not technically speaking there isnt much to criticize speaking of me i find this movie to be an okmovie
