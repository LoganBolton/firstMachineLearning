admittedly i watched this piece with already very low expectations dieter bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his egobr br this was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was 100 per cent humor free it is rude offensive redneck and blatantly anti women as such it is a creation befitting bohlen but the average viewer will be rather put off by it no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater it wouldve bombed big timebr br not even the expense of 65 megaeuros were able to save this utter piece of crap save your time and money
