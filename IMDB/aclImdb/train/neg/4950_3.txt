i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything batman tas may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet its just too damn good was batman beyond good yeah but it was no tas is justice league good its not too bad but its no tasbr br the batman is certainly no tas either but i wont hold that against it it would be unfair and besides it has plenty of other problems with itbr br the concept of a younger less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one and at times the art is very nice but all of the rest of the time the art is worthless americanime and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself it is paced written and designed like an americanime if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventures id watch jackie chan adventures or i could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect the joker is a homicidal mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight batman when he is forced to fight hand to hand he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched he is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kungfu and can leap into twenty feet into the air accompanied by speed lines if they had wanted to do that with a villain there were other less important characters they could have used or gasp they could have created a new one entirely and its not that reimaginings are a bad thing dont get me wrong tas there i go again took mr freeze from your standard icegunwielding b villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character of course freeze wasnt exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade but the point stands what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comics and lore and takes a large smelly dump on them guess what they were eating cornbr br its obvious this show cant stand against tas but stand it on its own legs and it still doesnt work for me the plots arent good and they dont develop any better theyve been written for the demographic of children under twelve should children be able to enjoy a show of course they should this shouldnt be an adult show with swearing nudity and gratuitous violence but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages this show misses that markbr br is this show a tas no of course not the problem is its not even a jlu
