i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a thumbs in the middle review remarking that id give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode ive seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006 and as a lifelong batman fanatic i can say without hesitation this show is utter crapbr br everythings wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any storiesbr br and for gods sakeis it just me or is the joker in every episode is gotham that much of a revolvingdoor justice system or again is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains see no character development abovebr br and to make matters worse every single joker tale is the same 3part formulabr br 1 joker gasses peoplebr br 2 joker sets out to gas the whole citybr br 3 batman saves the daybr br pfehbr br there was one episode i saw that wasnt a joker story the title escapes me but the villain was that nefarious cluemasterthe think thank thunk episode with the quiz show that was the singleworst batman story ive ever seen heard or read yes worse than ive got batman in my basement br br i cant really say what i feel this show is because its probably against the tos but it starts with b and rhymes with fastardization thank goodness for the existence of the timmdinietc era of batentertainment back from the fox and kids wb days stuff that good and i should have known this just couldnt possibly have lasted forever unfortunately
