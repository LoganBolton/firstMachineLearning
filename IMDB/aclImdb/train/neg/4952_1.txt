okay ive always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imaginedi was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesnt even begin to compare with the original series its like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker whoin my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much moredo not waste your time on this show or your money
