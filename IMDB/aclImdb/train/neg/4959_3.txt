remember the good ol animated batman show from the 90s the one that people praised the one that people of all ages could all appreciate the one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the hulk in a bat suit the one that had villains you could relate to the one that had villains with real motivesbr br well clearly warner bros doesnt hence this dreckbr br honestly do these people know anything about batman have they even looked at a batman comic before do they know batmans meant to be a detective putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective that makes you a slightly intelligent monkeybr br this is the basic layout for an episodebr br penguin steals something opening credits batman finds dead giveaway of where he is batman goes there and gets into trouble commercial batman finds obvious stupid way out of it penguin escapes penguin does something obvious again batman follows they do kungfu by the way everyone and i mean everyone knows kungfu for some reason batman punchs penguin he gets knocked out goes to arkham note its usually a different villain every episodebr br well as you may have noticed from that batmans not a great detective joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground maybe hes at the old amusement park yeah maybe he was there the last 6 timesbr br and ive already mentioned this but everyone knows kungfu even penguin what where they thinking probably because its from the people who made that jackie chan animated seriesbr br whats really upsetting is that the show is just action no smarts none if batman needs think hell use technology then do some kungfubr br but hey lets not forget the villains afterall what would batman be without his rogues gallerybr br well first off i gotta say kudos for originality i dont think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dreadlocked monkey man riddler like an emo and poison ivy as a minor which is kind of confusing when you think about isnt her sexuality meant to be her main strengthbr br whats even more crap however is that every character is now a 2dimensional stereotypical crookbr br egbr br killer croc wants to flood gotham for no reasonbr br manbat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reasonbr br penguin just wants to steal everything for no reasonbr br noticing a pattern herebr br but the most insulting has got to be mr freezebr br do you remember the emmy award winning heart of ice episode from batman the animated series the one that gave mr freeze motives for his crimes the episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story mad scientist the one that made him a victim with a goal hell even batman  robin acknowledged that using that as mr freezes origin in that pos moviebr br well this series says fck that and makes mr freeze a jewelry robber before his accident with only wealth in his mind then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold he then continues to steal jewels for no reason while saying sht lines like have an ice daybr br maybe they did watch batman robin after allbr br but hey look on the bright side this series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that youre a good person good for you
