i am a great fan of the batman comics and i became disappointed when i could no longer find batman the animated series on tv anymore i was excited to learn that there was going to be a new batman cartoon on tv i watched the first episode the day it premiered and i was very disappointedbr br first of all the animation is very poor it looks like a cheap crappy japanese anime then again just about every modernday cartoon is like thatbr br the character designs are even worse batman looks more like birdman catwoman looks more like chihuahuawoman bane looks more like a red version of the hulk the penguin is a kungfu master mr freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head and the riddler is a gothic marilyn manson lookalike which is funny because i dont expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be gothicbr br the worst character design is that of the joker they turned him into a monkeydemented bob marleykungfu fighter the joker is supposed to be batmans deadliest enemy but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless in one episode his plan was to put his joker venom in dog food oh how evil batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents which is why he fights crime this version of batman doesnt seem haunted by his parents deaths and is not interesting at all hes also not a detective just a fighter if theres an enemy he cant defeat he wont study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would hell just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them a lot of times this show doesnt even feel like a batman show just another brainless anime thats nothing but pointless fightingbr br what i hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains theyve taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys manbat is the biggest example in the comics hes a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness when experimenting on himself he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature in this show hes a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason just about all the villains are like that none of them with the exception of about one or two have an actual motive for their crimesbr br the worst characterization is that of mr freeze in the comics freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer paul dini wrote the btas episode heart of ice which gave freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic threedimensional and likable villain the episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin even that crappy movie batman  robin used it as his origin in this show hes a petty jewel thief before becoming mr freeze after becoming mr freeze guess what hes still a petty jewel thief great origin no wonder they used it over the one dini createdbr br as a batman fan i dont dislike this show just because it isnt like the comics because i also liked btas the batman cartoons that came after it tim burtons batman films and obviously the superb christopher nolan batman films none of them were 100 loyal to the comics but they were still very good the problem with this show is not that its not exactly like the comics or btas its that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other batman media so popularbr br ive given this show so many chances but the more i watch the more i find that disappoints me i miss the good old days back when batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy
