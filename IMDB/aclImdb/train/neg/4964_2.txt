this movie is a farce names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast and they have the gall to give beowulf a ridiculous cannoncrossbow weapon beowulf doesnt need a weapon like that in the poem he rips off grendels arm with his bare hands and i cant believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination unless you are a diehard fan of the epic poem beowulf avoid this film at all costs and even then i wouldnt recommend it
