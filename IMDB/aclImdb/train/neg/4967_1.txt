scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately such as minotaur or dog soldiers grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf however it deviates so much and offers so little in comparison that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it some shitty christopher lambert movie i wasnt expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production but i did however expect the artistic integrity to not interfere with the actual story even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slotsbr br did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing did any research go into this obviously not as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that beowulf and his crew save for mullet boy are wearing one major problem i have though was with the very look of grendelif beowulf is supposed to wrestle him shouldnt he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons grendels death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script for example grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by beowulf  not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs and grendels motherdid they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds and honestly what the hell was with that mullet br br if you want to see this movie because its connection to the epicdont as there really isnt one other than character names the only way i could recommend this film is if you liked the movie druids directed by jacques dorfmann  although i dont recommend watching either
