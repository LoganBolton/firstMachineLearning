i was expecting the movie based on grendel the book written by john gardner in the late 1970s it was based on the beowulf epic but told from the perspective of the monster br br whatever you may think of gardners book a movie based on the beowulf epic should not be entitled grendel when it doesnt say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the cg monster is shown as nothing more than a modified predator br br on top of this the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audiences throughout the usbr br typical hollywood to get this so wrong br br very disappointing and a complete waste of time
