first off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the scifi channel has produced that isnt to say that grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better the flaws of the film come from character design character absurd additions to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part the actingbr br when speaking of character design i of course mean the way our heroes and villains look beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous vikings rather than warriors of brute strength  that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly grendel looks like the hulk but with strange tentacleattachments to his elbowsbr br the characters are very limited beowulf is same from beginning to end however finn  a useless sidekick  achieved some twodimensionality due thanks to his romantic subplot and unferth gets some notion as well as he becomes less conceitedbr br much like finn there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material the crossbow that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous im surprised the cast didnt walk off the set besides additions theres omissions such as the underlying themes of christianity and paganism as well as the consequences of lyingbr br the special effects are mighty terrible grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived and as such theyre portrayal on screen is less than believablebr br the music is overbearing especially when a character diesbr br all in all this is not scifis worst film to date no it is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best the only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and therebr br i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert zemeckis take on the ancient story of beowulf simply because this film grendel is only half the tale and not the whole thing which garners this movie a threestar review
