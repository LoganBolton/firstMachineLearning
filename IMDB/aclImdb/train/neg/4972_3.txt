its hard to say what was the worst thing about this show the bad acting poor acoustics of different portions bad cgi improper sets for the period the poor script it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer  theres enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great deal of good material and a better story line than the scriptwriters could come up withbr br and why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive boltsbr br i see that this movie was made in only 21 days it shows in the lack of quality im beginning to think this is general poor attitude taken by scifi channel and others when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few yearsbr br what a waste
