i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a doubleshot automatic crossbow with sights on it not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights but beowulf beat grendel in handtohand combat the terrible wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all scifi original movies didnt help either having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my bile rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead thats really about all i have to say but you might as well just realize that its a madefortv movie and skip it right therebr br a travesty
