i watched grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a public service announcementbr br grendel is another version of beowulf the thousandyearold anglosaxon epic poem the scifi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies and the previews promised an inauthentic lowbudget miniepic but this one refused to let me switch channels it was staggeringly overwhelmingly bad i watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldnt tear your eyes away from i reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what i was seeing the following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity youve been warnedbr br  just to get it over with beowulfs warriors wore horned helmets trivial issue compared to what came after it also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next fit appearance and function were apparently irrelevantbr br  marina sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the ringling brothers barnum and bailey circus she managed to avoid a red rubber nose but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeupbr br  ben cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king his character hrothgar must have become king of the danes only minutes before the film opened and hadnt had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yetbr br  to facilitate the actors return to their day jobs waiting tables none were required to change their hairstyles at all the variety of hair included cornrows sideburns buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog to prove it was a multinational cast all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chosebr br  as is typical with this type of movie at least since mad max leather armor was a requirement in this case it was oddshaped illfitting and brandnewbr br  the female love interest ingrid played by alexis peters followed a longstanding tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely downbr br  the unintended focus of the movie was a repeating compound crossbow with exploding bolts it never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired it managed to shred the laws of physics the integrity of the original legend historical fact and plot suspense all by itselfbr br  hrothgars palace heorot rather than being a norse long hall apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with atlantisbr br  beowulf arrived at the danes homeland in a twomasted sterncastled ship that originally was part of a set the other two being the santa maria and the pintabr br  prince unferth observed beowulfs ships approach using a telescope before you could recover from that astounding innovation you got to see the ship from his point of view judging from the angle the prince was in an aircraft of some sortbr br  fun fact 1 in bulgaria fire as from a fireplace creates light without heat this explains why you could see the actors breath whether indoors or outbr br  fun fact 2 dark age dancing in denmark looks like slow dances i went to in the 8th gradebr br  fun fact 3 you too can make a catapult with a timedrelease airburst explosive but dont expect it to actually harm anything incidentally beowulf was apparently a veteran of world war ii yelling incoming to shred any remaining suspension of disbeliefbr br  grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely cgi creation he couldnt leave footprints even in snowbr br  grendels mom hag was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadnt inherited her wings recessive gene i suppose by the way we can now make an educated guess that grendels pop was probably swamp thingbr br  grendel and mom chose to randomly kill fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the scriptbr br  fun medical fact being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that dont bleed muchbr br  the sword of legend beowulf used to dispatch the hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the golden gate bridge luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weightbr br  best line of the movie prince unferth had just been impaled by hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet princess ingrid cradled him gently and said youre going to be okay my prince so much for that job at the triage clinicbr br i feel better now
