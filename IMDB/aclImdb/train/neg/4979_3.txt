why oh why cant anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second adaptation of beowulf ive been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version beowulf  grendel starring gerald butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess br br what bugged me most was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason human sacrifices pointless love interest or the bad cgi or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow br br and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film he was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didnt knock him out he was much too reliant on weapons beowimp is more like it this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem br br id like to end this on a positive note but i cant really think of one offhand all i can say is if youve ever read beowulf youll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation
