this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isntbr br some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in spacenot really what they do these arent party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson ripoff alien who always wears his sunglasses other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kidbr br this is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybebr br my rating 12 out of  100 mins pg for mild language
