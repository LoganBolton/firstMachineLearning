corridors of time the movie you can watch if youre looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains  do not wait any longer  corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes  thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me  sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a 210 but thats only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think im gonna dislike him
