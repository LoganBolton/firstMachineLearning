in 1993 the visitors was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made br br this is a movie that doesnt keep its promises indeed its supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddleheaded sometimes a bit of a messbr br but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie theyre going over the top and become annoying then why did jeanmarie poiré the filmmaker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems illatease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors arent better marieanne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau unbearablebr br  of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her weddingbr br a labored and disappointing followup anyway whats the interest of this movie otherwise commercialbr br
