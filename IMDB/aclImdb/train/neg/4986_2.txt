everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but thats not the only reason why this movie is really bad its actually so bad that im not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark if the first episode of les visiteurs was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it clavier is overacting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like lemercier because shes replacing her but thats grotesque lemercier is lemercier robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because shes not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played lemercier playing her role as for the story its just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and déjàvu no really theres no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment 210
