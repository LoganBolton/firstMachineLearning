one of the worst movies ive seen shoddy camera work crappy filter usage film was grainy script was terrible i mean come on how predictable was the big battle at the endbr br some of the fight scenes were okay i guessbr br some scenes were so bad it was comical like sorbo getting the horse and riding at the endlol i mean really a horse oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movieone would think that after killling key witness and federal agents they woulda been tracked downetc etc really dont bother watching it
