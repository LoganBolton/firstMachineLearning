i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but wow did it turn corny or should i say just plain stupid this is just another example of outdated humor it might have been funny in 1940 but not nownot even closebr br dick powell is always interesting to watch i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where hes mature and sounds it toobr br he was fine as jimmy macdonald but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters the worst being the boss raymond walburn of the maxford house coffee company who did nothing but shout all the time he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie
