how did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast ridiculous predictable and thoroughly unbelievable this is wellacted and slickly directed but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the alltime worst thrillers ive seen in years amazingly bad and not in a fun way avoid at all costs even if youre a fan of someone in the cast
