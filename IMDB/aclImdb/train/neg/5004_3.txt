wow its ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days agobr br anyways i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl for the recordbr br the movie was ridiculous the characters drove me insane they were so cliché and stereotyped this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard it had way too many plot twists toobr br there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however the scene warm heart cold gun where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower well actually they were all obnoxious but his acting in that scene was excellent the look on his face it reminded my of american psycho a good movie the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for do yourself a favor and dont watch it
