nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an audience like or empathize with any of the characters either there are movies so bad they are good a la ed wood or tod slaughter films and theres just plain bad like 99 of uwe bolls work this film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented mstie riffer eg mystery science theatre 3000 thankfully while i am rather talented in that regard its how my mind works all the time for those who are not so naturally talented in mstie riffing eventually into this film youll just want to pull your own head off painfully aware the movie taboo robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes youll never get back even my mstie talents were barely a match for this slow paced boring waste of time the most puzzling aspect of this film is that someone greenlit andor funded it i rented taboo solely for the normally talented amber benson who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film ive another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue the reviews to which id better read first ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location
