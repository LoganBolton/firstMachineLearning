this was quite possibly the worst film ive ever seen the plot didnt make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful im a big fan of amber benson i think shes usually a wonderful actress i cant imagine why she decided to do this film her character piper is drunk for almost the whole film with the exception of the opening scene on the plus side there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad i actually laughed out loud but despite that i would not recommend this film to anyone its only 80 minutes long but thats 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted
