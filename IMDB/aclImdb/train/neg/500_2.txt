the bloodsucker leads the dance  what a laughable title its so utterly misleading its not surprising that the filmmakers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible moviebr br the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote islandbr br very little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voiceartists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remediallevel morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voiceartists cannot be blamed for the script its a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tediousbr br the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience it doesnt remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen all we get is a few halfhearted severed head shotsbr br a few people have said that this movie is a giallo i cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it its basically a softcore porn film with a horror angle but its not very erotic eitherbr br i cant recommend this to anyone
