and i never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1 but this one is honestly the worst movie ive ever watched my wife picked it up because of the cast but the storyline right since the dvd box seemed quite predictable it is not a mystery nor a juvenilecatching film it does not include any sensuality if thats what the title could remotely have suggest any of you this is just a total nono dont waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a asgrownup kind of gothic setting where a killer is going after them nothing new nothing interesting nothing worth watching max makowski makes the worst of nick stahl
