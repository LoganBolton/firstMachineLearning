i watched this movie on the grounds that amber benson rocks and nick stahl is generally pretty cool  i figured that any film featuring two actors i like and respect couldnt be all bad and in that sense i was right  considering the cringemaking dialogue they were given both of them perform reasonably well not well enough to stop the movie from sucking you understand but well enough that i was able to make it through the 75odd minutes of movie and thats the main sign of an awful film when at 40 minutes through youre already praying for it to be overbr br its hard to know where to start with the problems in taboo the dialogue as mentioned is appalling wooden and completely unnatural january jones acting is unbelievably bad and since shes the character we spend most of our time following around the house this is an unforgivable flaw the plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clich√©d as to be completely predictable literally not one of the major twists in this film would surprise anyone but a toddler a few interesting shots aside the director tries far too hard with far too little success awkward tracking shots and jittery camerawork distracting from what little element of story there isbr br three of this movies stars are awarded for the fact that it contains amber benson and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone ever under any circumstances avoid at all costs
