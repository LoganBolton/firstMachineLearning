i wont argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable as is january joness performance but please check her out if you havent already in the amc tv series mad men starting later this month shes excellent as is the entire cast ill charitably assume she took on the taboo role strictly for the money and realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation dont know if thats the case but i now know for sure that she can actbr br at first watching taboo i was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot no such luck hard to believe the director didnt suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjawbr br ironically her winning performance in mad men comes as a character who at least in her early appearances is very repressed reserved unsure of herself and rather colorless not unlike her taboo role but as the tv series progressed she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early60s whitebread mom role cant wait to see where they take her character in the 2nd seasonbr br to sum up avoid taboo like leprosy but definitely check out mad men
