the movie has the longest most tortured and agonized ending of any movie ive seen in a long time unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits january jones gives such a wooden performance i was surprised she didnt go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film i dont really remember her from the other films shes done a blessing i have to believe i never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this caseit is so bad that it actually stands out from the atrocious script granted shes given lines and situations meryl streep would have trouble with but i swear at times shes reading from a cue card off set at other times i thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way for real the plot dialog and pacing are as bad as youll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated i feel sorry for the other actors cruel intentions 10 little indiansbreakfast club shoved into a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a grade school writer director take that back this has studio exec crayola all over it
