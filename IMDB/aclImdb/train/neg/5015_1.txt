as a movie critic for several dutch websites i have to see lots of movies and not all very good ones some movies are so bad you wont be surprised that they are released straight on video with taboo i√°m surprised that it is released on video at all this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish br br a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo they write down their most sickening wish or act and later on people are murdered for their taboos the question is should we believe what we seebr br the movie has a potential interesting plottwist and i wont give it away here but what could have been interesting stays stupid bad acted and without any reasonbr br some of the actors have played in bigger titles before so why on earth did they sign up for this if you see this anywhere try to dodge it there is no logic no human sense of quality in this movie
