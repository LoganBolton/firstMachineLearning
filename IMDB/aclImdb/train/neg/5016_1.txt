the name of nick stahl the young cast and the attractive cover of the vhs made me buy and watch this flick expecting to see a good teen slash movie what a crap the full of clichés screenplay the dialogs and the performances are awful dreadful very bad terrible horrendous  summarizing a complete waste of time there is no horror black humor only an absolutely boring story with shameful plot points the film begins with six characters indeed three couples together like a group of friends but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies playing a ridiculous senseless game called taboo and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues that is it no previous development of the characters the viewer does not know who they are their motives and relationship then there is an ellipsis to one year later and the same group is gathered together in a new years eve party insulting each other in a very sordid way but the plot and the twists are so ridiculous predictable mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review one advice only do not waste your time or money on this garbage you will certainly regret my vote is one awfulbr br title brazil taboo  jogando com o assassino taboo  playing with the killer
