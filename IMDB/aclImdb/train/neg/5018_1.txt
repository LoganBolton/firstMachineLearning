i rented this film just to see amber benson though after reading the box i thought it sounded like a good storyhowever the first problem was that there really wasnt a storyor actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense the second problem was there was no set up for these charactersyes i got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didnt like each otherso why did they keep getting together flaw number 3the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense especially with the typical suspense music dubbed inhe was sadly mistaken it was painful to watch a terrific actress like amber benson waste time trying to bring this back to lifemy only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film
