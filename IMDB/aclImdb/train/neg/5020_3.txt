this is the most messed up entry on imdb that ive yet to stumble across all the previous reviewers act like this is the movie this is not the movie rather its merely a featurette thats an extra on the dvd of the movie the one it also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that its listed here as in actuality its barely over 13 minutes of how cool jet li can do martial arts and his reflections on the movie so yeah this imdb entry is quite a bit fubar dont listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong you can trust me because i never feed you dear reader bsbr br and thats the truth i guess u can say that im the one reviewer that matters
