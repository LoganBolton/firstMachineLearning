oh dear this movie was bad for various reasons i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the overall scoresorry but to rate this highly as many have is a joke once you get past the one shotblack and white movie gimmick which was a nice idea the movie drags on even at a run time of only 66 minutes the credits sequence at the start was so annoying tooin the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel wow that was needed in the story how slow were the guys chasing and actually managing to wound campbell they did not seem to bother continue chasing himsighi am only too glad i got this free with a special edition of evil dead
