nobody but nobody could chew the scenery like the divine one ruth elizabeth davis and elizabeth and essex is a great example why although she overplays the part at times watch her when she gawfs about raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladiesinwaiting are about to play in that one moment she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely at other times she is done in by the scripts sappiness when elizabeth has to be vulnerable she comes off as weak and shrewish this has the added effect of undermining her authority when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice its hard to take her seriouslybr br flynn exudes charm making us see how essex was able to worm his way into elizabeths heart but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man it also doesnt help that essex is badly underwritten why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen  even as he swears fidelity to her  except only that he is more blueblooded thus more worthy of rule and why does raliegh betray elizabeth by intercepting her and essexs letters hes in no risk of falling out of favor and we know where essex and his head is headed so why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitablebr br what did curtiz do with all the  he was given he doesnt even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage he shouldve ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower everything else that follows especially the final scene between her and essex is unnecessary the costumes are fantastic and is it me or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon
