this clever film was originally a japanese film and while i assume that original film was pretty bad it was made a good bit worse when americaninternational films hacked the film to pieces and inserted americanmade segments to fool the audience now unless your audience is made of total idiots it becomes painfully obvious that this was doneand done with little finesse or care about the final product the bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly japanese scenes and then clearly american scenes where the film looks quite different plus the american scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about gamerathe evil flying turtle and although this is a firebreathing flying and destructive monster there is practically no energy because i assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched filmin particular film veterans brian donlevy and albert dekker they both just looked tired and illatease for being therebr br now as for the monster its not quite the standard godzillalike creature seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious on the other hand the crappy model planes destructible balsa buildings and power plant are as usual in this film and come as no surprise plus an odd japanese monster movie clich√© is included that will frankly annoy most nonjapanese audience members and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him yeah right well just like in godzilla versus the smog monster and several other films youve got this annoying creep cheering on the monster though unlike later incarnations of godzilla gamera is not a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot silly exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven yearold bad acting meaningless american clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film oddly while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to bergman and kurosawa dont believe themthis is a terrible filmbr br fyiapparently due to his terrific stage presence gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations none of these change the central fact that he is a firebreathing flying turtle or that the movies are really really lame
