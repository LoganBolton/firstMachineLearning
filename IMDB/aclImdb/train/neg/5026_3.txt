flame in flame out that seems to be gammera in a nutshell a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon im not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd scifi collection put out by mill creektreeline films its a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offeringsbr br gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast and hes not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at plan z the hope of the world and wouldnt you know it theres a scene where a huge shed is shown thats called the z plan building that was a nice touchbr br by the mid 1960s this country still wasnt quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there werent any privates aroundbr br good old gammera was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged thats why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship whisking him off to mars to save the world high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save now lets get back to the cold warbr br like godzilla gammera spawned at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying flaming turtles especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said gammera sayonara
