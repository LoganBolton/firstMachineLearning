this movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors or presumed actors a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent giallio torso directed by sergio martino in 1973 two years before one of the most celebrated psychothrillers of italian cinema and a cultmovie around the world in la sanguinusa conduce la danza the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an peepingtom watching from a window of the bedroom naturally the scene in rizzos movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martinos film to put another black girl another white girl and another peepingtom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzos movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all i think that such things are an offense to spectator
