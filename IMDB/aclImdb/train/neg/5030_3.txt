whats that there in the skies is it a plane is it superman errr no its a turtle see thats what becomes of the cold war nothing but bad news and other issues the americans shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts  literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtlecreature named gammera heshe is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path the arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and supersophisticated icebomb but gammera has another surprise in store the damn turtle can fly the first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air how can you not love that then theres also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid whos able to telepathically communicate with the monster but thats just not interesting enough flying turtle people theres very little else to write about this japanese and american reedited scifi effort apart from that its an obvious and totally shameless ripoff of such classics like the original godzilla and the beast from 20000 fathoms the effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and unlike the aforementioned films it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance respectable actors like brian donlevy the quatermass experiment and dick oneill wolfen seem unaware of what film set theyre on and even the original japanese mayhemscenes arent very convincing gammeras very own and personalized themesong is rather cool though so it gets one extra point for that
