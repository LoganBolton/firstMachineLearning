plot  melissa is a new girl in town shes fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week since melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously diebr br to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isnt a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie when i started watching it i realized that sweet sixteen isnt a very good slasher its really dull and boring and just doesnt go anywhere after over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasnt really developed in any possible waybr br the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s the movie suffers from being too dark at times the acting is actually pretty good though and melissas character is easy to sympathize with even though shes a complete slutbr br the story line isnt completely rubbish but its just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this moviebr br all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesnt go anywhere id definitely wouldnt recommend it to slasher fans
