i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever perhaps if the only chinese movies youve seen contained no dialogue long drawnout faraway stares and silences and hack editing then youre spot onbr br complicated storyline hardly try juvenile and amateurish exquisite moods and haunting memories hardly try flatout boring and tritebr br this was awful i could not wait for it to be over particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of how are you im fine are you sure yes wow what depth of character i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for thembr br as a huge fan of many chinese japanese and korean films i was totally disappointed in this even zhangs sentimentally sappy the road home was better than this
