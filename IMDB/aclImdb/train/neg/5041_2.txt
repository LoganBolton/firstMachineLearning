ye lous film purple butterfly pits a secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her exlover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meetingbr br i agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitutes a convoluted semihistorical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting doesnt help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless normally i dont mind dark movies but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i dont think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and i dont believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments dont add to its watchabilitybr br the actors are all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminatorbr br all in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he 210
