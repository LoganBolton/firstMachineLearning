the main complaint with this film is the fact that i can not tell who is who no racism intended but these asians look all the same i can tell somewhat of the story but heck thats about as far as it goes the peoples identities are not a mystery if they were a mystery i would care about them instead i wasnt them off the screen asapbr br tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie heck is it boring not only do i not know these people but they are just sitting therebr br the production is typical chinese john woo terrible video with blotched scenes this looks only slightly better than andy laus fulltime killer which was a great movie you would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s hollywood i didnt know the chinese had these arthouse beatniks
