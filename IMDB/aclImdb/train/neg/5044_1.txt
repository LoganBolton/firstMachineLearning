i was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the new york times in addition im also shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter however after watching it i was extremely disappointedbr br the movies pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous the director lingered on certain scenes for much too long there was no passion or chemistry between the lovers there was barely any dialogue dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting at the end of the movie you didnt feel any compassion for the characters this movie was lacking in everything the script was weak the acting was poor and the editing was nonexistent the director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably a good movie is one in which captures your attention maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by this movie felt as though it would never end dont waste your money on this movie
