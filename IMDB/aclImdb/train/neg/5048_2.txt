i tried i really did i thought that maybe if i gave joao pedro rodrigues another chance i could enjoy his movie i know that after seeing o fantasma i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor so i was like what the hell at least you didnt pay 10 dollars at the quad give it a shotbr br sometimes its better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain i often wonder if it wouldnt be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it on other occasions i often think that the world is really flat and that if i sail away far enough i will not only get away from it all but fall clear over and that some evil lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life  and some french fries from 1995 still lingering inside my esophagus  out of mebr br is there a reason for odete id say not at all just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness one that makes alex forrest look like strawberry shortcake look not only creepy but flatout sick to the bone she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend in shrieking hysterics because she wants a child and he believes theyre too young she later crashes a funeral of a gay man and  get this  in order to get closer to him she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead mans mother and lover in the sickest of ways oh of course she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one but a good three times on his grave and theres this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes pedro which sums up some weakasbadtea explanation that love knows no gender or somethingbr br id say shes as nuts as a can of cashews unsalted but then again sos the director and me for taking a chance on this at least the men look good other than that not much else to see here
