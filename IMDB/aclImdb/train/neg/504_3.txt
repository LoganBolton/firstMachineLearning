a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot if anything the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo with a strong dose of erotica only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout  actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful here we get the usual group of people an acting troupe stranded on an island to which they were invited by a count  since he had become enamored of the leading lady a deadringer for his missing spouse the characters are pretty much stereotypes middleaged but dashing hero played by giacomo rossistuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy demure heroine sluttish companion recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot a meek but devoted stage manager forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior a couple of lesbians a mysterious gardener the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who for once gets in on the action if you know what i mean an envious housekeeper nominal star femi benussi though for what it is worth this is really an ensemble piece a religious fanatic of a butler an impressionable chambermaid etc while the film is not by any means unwatchable the atrocious dubbing snails pace shoddy production with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some blackandwhite film and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding halfhour do not help matters besides marcello giombinis score though pleasant in itself comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances that said the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here
