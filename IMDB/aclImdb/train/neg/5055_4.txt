two years ago at sundance i loved josh kornbluths directing debuthaiku tunnel so i was looking forward to his brother and frequent collaborator jacobs the best thief in the world this is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lowerclass area of new york the movie is not without its poignant moments but at times it is as if kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious life can be very difficult for some people and life isnt fairbr br more subtle and more important is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the antisocial behavior they may spawn these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity we can recoil at their language and their living conditions but we are cannot discount their intent and in fact their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for the people is evident throughoutbr br having said all this the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws including the title the characters arent very believable the writing is uneven and the plotline is barely discernible and for many the most disturbing is that kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes to each his own but while i dont question the potential realism of this phenomenon it pains me to see 5yearold children mfing and talking about having sex with a lineup of women its unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest
