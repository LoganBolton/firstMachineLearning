very outdated film with awful clichéridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction in addition cassavetes and falk overact constantly a pseudo good movie it takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is the first scene is a total bore filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges the sound is horrible camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters no poetry no subtle psychology no interesting shots the actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages very cheap indeed one exception  ned beatties nice and simple way of playing the hit man
