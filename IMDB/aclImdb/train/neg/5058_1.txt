when will i ever learn the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane please allow me to vent my spleenbr br i will admit the setting presumably new york city has never been so downright ugly and unappealing i am reminded that the 70s was a bad decade for mens fashion and automobiles and all the smoking if the plan was to cheapen the characters it succeededbr br for a film to work at least in my simple estimation there has to be at least one sympathetic character only ned beaty came close and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky if a stray shot had struck mikey well it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the mostbr br i cant remember when i detested a film as strongly i suppose im a rube who doesnt dig art flicks oh well
