anurag basu who codirected the flop kucch to hai made his debut in this film br br the film was ahead of its times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to hawas which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better businessbr br the movie starts off well malikas guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with emraan malika is too crudevulgarbr br the scenes between emraan and malika are well handled and the twist in the tale where ashmith confronts emraan is brilliantbr br the pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of emraan isnt fully convincingbr br also the cop track seems half bakedbr br the finale is too filmy toobr br direction by anurag basu is good music is a winner all songs were fab camerawork was stunningbr br emraan played his naughty streak very well this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb ashmith too was good in his role for once he did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half but her dial delivery was at times not up to the mark sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films raj jhutsi is okay
