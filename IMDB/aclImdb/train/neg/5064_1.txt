i dont believe they made this film completely unnecessary the first film was okay but there was no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film this film feels like a soapopera the writing is so bad its utterly simple the jokes dont come across the acting is flat its shot like a soap it lacks any direction the first film had a good emotional spine behind it every character had a little arc it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film but this time around there is no cohesive storyline the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens one good thing the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleires son is pretty well cast that was their one moment of creative success on this film i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to team spirit 2 but please god dont let them make a third feature installment
