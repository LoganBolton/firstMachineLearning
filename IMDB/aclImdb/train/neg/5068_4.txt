i am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has havent said that friends was at best an average sitcom and not as great as others have made out lets face it if it wasnt for the casting of courtney cox arquette david schwimmer matthew perry lisa kudrow jennifer aniston and matt le blanc then who knows whether this show wouldve lasted as long as it has done i very much doubt that although as the series progressed friends got more progressively predictable lame and boring that i couldnt care less about the characters of whom are the most overrated in tv history or of their plight nor of who was sleeping with whom and it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny and even when it had all these alist hollywood actors from the movie world i still didnt bother to tune in the writing in friends became stale that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending well it was predictable to say the leastbr br what was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good the show shouldve came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries in truth as much as the series waned it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves not the other way round br br when it ended in 2004 i was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom now there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our tv screens very soon and yet i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever
