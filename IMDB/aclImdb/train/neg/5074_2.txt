i saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des nouvelles images du japon in paris though i wasnt expecting much from it i have to say ive been disappointed just like many people in the audience if i wanted to sum up how i felt id say ive been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end of course its silly but i couldnt help it the stories are quite different but the worlds pictured are very much alike and from this point of view a tree of palme definitely cant stand the comparison with miyazakis masterworks even if its quite good technically boredom remains in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it i rated it 2 out of 10 a bit harsh i guess it deserves 3 or 4
