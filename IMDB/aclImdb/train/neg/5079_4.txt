what a great actor to have in such an awful storybr br the film and its production however is quite good even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol no matter  see one cathedral youve seen em all sort ofbr br the story howeveris about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything should he so wish with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy a teenager and finally as a man so much so in fact that he exacts vengeance at will literally over time he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about itbr br the trouble with the narrative however is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasireligious claptrap to produce a hodgepodge theory about it all mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and im afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing his very best scene however is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp witty and deadly dialog delivered as only burton couldbr br a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better though beginning with lino ventura whom i last saw in garde a vu 1981 as inspector brunel harry andrews as assistant commissioner the much underrated lee remick as dr zonfeld derek jacobi as a publisher towney and a few other well known character actorsbr br i liked the way the story was presented as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar richard burton the writer with the killer disposition up till that point it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick still it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the wouldbe murdererbr br then they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes if you want a clue about what that is think samson and delilah 1949 from the illustrious cecil b de mille and how samson got the bad guys in the end and the very last scene is just plain stupid why because there are at least a hundred ways that morlars rampaging could have been stopped absolutelybr br shame actually because this could have been a lot better story and movie i guess burton really needed the moneybr br if youre burton fan then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above otherwise dont bother
