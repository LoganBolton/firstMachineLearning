in contrast to my fellow reviewers i always try to find something redeeming in any film i seeyes the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood drippingsomething must be lost in the translation of the word bloodsucker from the italian in the title almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence so tacked it onto the film anywaybr br this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the filmnow anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect  italian softporn from the mid 1970si bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli credited most often as krista nellthe absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s  70si had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list it is very difficult to link them to the actor concernedi think krista nell played cora but underneath that massive hair style costume and makeup it is difficult to distinguish her for surebr br there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands outmaybe something is lost in the dubbing processwhat were the positive pointswell the music was atmospheric and of course if youre into beautiful lesbian soft porn its therethe external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its islandit purports to be set in ireland north or the republicin 1902 so everyone sports period piece costumessome of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenesanyway an enjoyable rompi rated it 410
