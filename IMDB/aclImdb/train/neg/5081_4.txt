was there a single positive to this film critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made no damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary examplebr br and i may have missed something but wasnt super mario bros 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before well if that is the case and i did not miss anything how did fred savages character and even the girl know so much about the game already were talking things that some people dont know about by their second or third playthroughbr br beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself nothing here is honestly very memorable the kid wasnt even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed a lot of kids i knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced on top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points the characters are bland and completely uninteresting the wizard the youngest child is a very silent completely dry child clich√© of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma it isnt that this is unrealistic its the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutesbr br honestly the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature if you grew up with this movie youre going to like it whether it was good or not it was about kids playing video games and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the nes as well but unless you loved it as a kid there just isnt anything thats going to keep you interested and very little that will prevent you from turning it offbr br no sir i didnt like it
