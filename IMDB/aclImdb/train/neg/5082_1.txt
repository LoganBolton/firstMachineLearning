its very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera its unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania  the worst of them get to be sent abroad  eg chicago international film festival this movie without a plot  acting or script is a waste of time and money score 002 out of 10
