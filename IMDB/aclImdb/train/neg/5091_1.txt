my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos battle for space shown on russias first channel on april 1013 2006 bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt its the case the number of factual errors is such that its impossible to list them especially in the first episode the development of first missiles even the us half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions the audience is not told of any v2a4 launches from the us three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number ue onboard apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon etc in the russian half each and every person is ludicrous korolev is scared of nkvd glushko is saboteur and traitor mishin is alcoholic etc men as functions no motivation no life at all uniform and decorations are awful gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch i think this was added specially for russian version
