i sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads gérard philippe and michèle morgan were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was they both gave fine performances but of distasteful charactersbr br indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters the doctor is of course the major exception what michèle morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explainedbr br this is supposedly based on a work by jeanpaul sartre all i could think was that if sartres work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus masterful novel the plague which dealt with a plague in north africabr br a wellacted but uninteresting movie
