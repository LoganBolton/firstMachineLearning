contrary to most other commentators i deeply hate this seriesbr br it starts out looking interesting with mysterious aliens and giant robots and i kept my hopes up until the very last episode at the end of it i still didnt understand what the alien attacks were all about maybe i missed something who knows and realized that i had sat through 26 episodes consisting mainly of the characters own selfhating selfishness and selfpitying it actually flips between alienrobot fights and these dark depressing blinkingonandoff scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout i hate meyouit 1012 times in a rowbr br i cant really see either shinji or asuka two of the main characters showing growth or change nor can i see any of the other characters learning or growing either for that matter i wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes and the feeling didnt change during the last ones shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable and asuka is such an infuriating knowitall that i wanted to smash the tv screen every time she came into view oh and more than anyone else these two hate everything and say it veeeeeeeery oftenbr br im otherwise a big fan of anim√© and manga and never before have i disliked one so much i read that the series creatorwriter wrote this while suffering from a depression and i can believe that it made me depressed to watch it is that the aim of this series im honestly asking is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed and if suffering from a depression why just not write a book or biography about it instead of mixing it up with aliens and mechas this alien war plot as far as i could tell lead to absolutely nowherebr br finally since im truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of deadend plots i cant help but wonder how many of them actually find it good and how many say they do because theyve been told it is
