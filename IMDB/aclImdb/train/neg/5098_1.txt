this has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made and yes i was even shown the end of evangelion and that still made me hate it even more not to mention the countless ripoffs of this showbr br i dont mind psychological and philosophy untertones but evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting the only ones that seemed to be interesting were asuka misato and penpen other than that mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers they need to go to a psyciatric center not piloting giant robots against aliens called angelsbr br even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all goes something like thisbr br well there are these robots and they are really cool because they bleed when they get hurt but they are not really mecha but captured angels so sometimes they go insane and dont do what the underaged pilots want and they have to be controlled betterblah blah blahbr br i am so sorry but i just cannot recommend evangelion to anyone anime otakus or not to those who love this series greatly fine youre entitled to that opinion i respect you but to thoses that have a out of your mind obsession to think that every one will like this series you are more of an egotistbr br i prefer macross mospeada rundim and robot taekwon v myself
