this incredibly overrated anime television series 26 episodes 25 minutes each is about a 14yearold boy and two of his girl classmates who pilots a giant robot to defend japan against invading beings called angels there is very little explanation given to the angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans youre attempting to destroy the robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occursbr br some might be intrigued by fans who mention the very few symbolic references herein but thats all they are  shallow oneliners to religious or philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship as a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters who are really nothing more than selfpitying crybabies the psychology is pathetic with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like i hate my father repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value its no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from timewasting mediocrity to angerinducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless angstridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble some of which is totally meaninglessbr br im not kidding when i say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed every day id look at the dvd set sitting on my living room table and say to myself damn ive gotta watch the next episode at some point sigh i may as well slug through another one tonight the real kicker was that the episodes were only 25 minutes long yet they were somehow able to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening 10 minutes this is coming from a guy who will happily sit through 150minute films with glacial pacing so my criticism of this series is most damning indeedbr br never in my entire life have i despised watching a series as much as evangelion i had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on imdb and i certainly wasnt going to let it collect dust after spending my hardearned money what followed was 10 hours of pure unmitigated torture my lovehate relationship with anime is turning into a hatelove relationship after this highly acclaimed disasterbr br evangelion represents everything anime should not be  massive quantities of dull pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema the universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as one of mankinds greatest achievements is probably the most stupifying comment ive ever heard on imdb  and ive seen some doozies
