this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the scifi thrillergiant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psychobabble and quasireligious preachy exploitation if you want to hear youre ok its good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good scifi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy
