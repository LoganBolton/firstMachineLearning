now whats wrong with the actors that took part in that crap michael dorn should stick to the star treck merchandise john diehl does anyone remember him in miami vice liked him there well whatever  what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead nothing and thats what we get none of the characters is even likable the special effects are hilarious but not funny the story is a very bad joke there is no logic whatsoever for whats happening i got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of attack of the killer tomatoes kind of thing especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closetbr br if you happen to see it on tv switch channels  your tv set will be ever thankful
