alien love  as this movie is known in britain  is a very strange movie  i dont mean that its an esoteric art house movie in the style of peter greenaway or derek jarman  i mean its a tvm with swearing  sex  some really good ta  a bad script and a very retro feel  you can just imagine someone like john hughes directing this ten years earlier  though of course he would have cut out the ta br br going back to the bad script  one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially amanda  why does she pick up connie at the bar  just so she could meet an alien  do you see what i mean about retro  et  short circuit and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here  the storyline continues to follow an ill defined  unconvincing and illogical path br br that said i did find alien love watchable and not only down to the ta on display  as a a scifi sex comedy its much better than flesh gordon and earth girls are easy
