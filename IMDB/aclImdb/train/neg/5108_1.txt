i cant help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tearjerking for one its entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homesbr br how can these families afford to maintain these new megahouses and what about their poor neighbors property taxes must surely increase after this happens plus the noise would annoy mebr br second how excessive can a reality television show become its practically the same repetitive junk week after week were introduced to a suffering family they renovate the home then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the kleenex boxesbr br not to mention how boring the renovation part is the only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbingbr br extreme makeover home edition is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat skip this one if you like reality television survivor is far superior and moving
