extreme makeover home edition is yet another feelgoody socalled heart warming and outforratings show that abc has had the time to put togetherbr br i understand the troubles that these families go through for that i am sorry but wouldnt you think that putting four widescreen plasma televisions three flatscreen desktop computers an inground pool taking up half of a backyard and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a bit too excessive for any family sure these families have been through a lot sure they deserve nicer things that what they had previously hadbr br but honestly the things that ty pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhoodbr br another thing that really irks me about this show is how ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family or the familys condition telling a wheelchairbound person that he or she is so strong or very brave really does get old after a while that may sound rude but believe me watch this show and youll see what i meanbr br all in all this show is overrated if you want to watch it go ahead this comment is just a headsup for what youd be watching
