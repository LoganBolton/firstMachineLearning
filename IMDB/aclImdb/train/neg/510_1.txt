this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio the plot is simply stupid the dialog is written in clich√©s you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this the acting is ridiculously bad especially that of rod cameron the choreography is silly and wholly unerotic one can only pity the reviewer who saw 23yearold yvonnes dance as sexual its merely very bad choreography the ballet scene in the films beginning is especially ludicrous if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywoods turkeys this is for you i bought the colorized version on vhs making the movie even worse yvonnes heavy makeup when colored has her looking like a clown all the time and shes the best part of this film what a way to launch a career
