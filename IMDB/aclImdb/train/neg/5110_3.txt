i occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes i try to enjoy it for its basic idea which is helping a needy family but several factors get in the way for me every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted which they are and tears flow seemingly on cue the attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me the fact that everyone who donates something to the house be it sears or whoever has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying probably the biggest problem i have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family now i know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for disneyabc but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights isnt life difficult enough for the average person why do i need help finding things to feel sad about why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative i know what is being done for these families is good but they are also being used for ratings you cant tell me they arent being coached sometimes on the crying i guess when i see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the us could not afford for their children it really bothers me i cant help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of disneys money instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen tv and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food clothes education and medical insurance i know so we can be entertained and have a good cry in terms of money i feel the same about oprah i dont think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses yes her recent reality show did good things but when she gave 30000 to each losing contestant im sitting here thinkingthats a years salary for many many peopleif theyre lucky dont get me started on game shows so i realize that extreme makeover home edition is doing good but forgive me if i see it as more self serving than giving of itself is there anyone out there that feels similar
