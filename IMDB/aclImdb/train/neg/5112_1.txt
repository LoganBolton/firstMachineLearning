awwwwyes it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by abcsears and has their home renovated thats where the humanistic appeal ends i liked it early in its run but now this show has become disgustingly excessivebr br ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on the people at habitat for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief for example is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or have his bed trickedout with low rider hydraulics does the mom really need her dilapidated nonrunning and rusted out old pickup truck restored and pimped by some of the best customizers in california a new one would have done the job quite nicely and probably for a third of the price do people really need a sixtyfive inch plasma screen in every room of the house and then theres the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills even after the zaniacs at makeover leave somebody still has earn a living i doubt the friendly folks down at social services will see the humor in all of this largessbr br this show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for abc and a tacit commercial for its sponsors
