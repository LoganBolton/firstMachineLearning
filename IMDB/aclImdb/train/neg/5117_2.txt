i want to state first that i am a christian and that i do work in the film and tv industry so i understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard im all for positive uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life that this is a fallen world and that things dont always work out  even for followers of christ im glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt christian message for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face a movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes exposition aplenty and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least i believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across im sure the kendrick bros will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well maybe they could direct someone elses screenplay as their next projectbr br  sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one hoosiers field of dreams etc can inspire in a multitude of ways if you would be interested in a pgrated film that inspires give steven soderberghs king of the hill a look all truth is gods truth
