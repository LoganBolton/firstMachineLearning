i am a christian and i say this movie had terrible acting unreal situations and a completely facade front for christianity you might as well watch remember the titans and at least not mix christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this filmbr br 1 the school was in georgia and was a white academy school i did not notice a single black student or player in the school i deal with the white christian academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation this is troubling when the movie is about christianity and christ changing liveshow about changing the hearts of segregation note i loved the token black coach like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black giants players br br 2 the uncritical acclaim by everyone christian about this movie can i get a couple people to say that it was bad acting bad filming bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies if we were to compare this to another football movie would it have the same charisma and energy br br 3 the halfbaked christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending if christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change then dont wonder when no one will listen to what christians have to say we want to sell christ as a cureall he doesnt need sold and he doesnt need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles no wonder everyone considers christianity to be antiintellectual with this unreal presentationbr br i recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people to most it will not be it will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension most importantly to me it is not christian by any means or stretch it has values but it falls short as a pullyourselfupbythebootstraps message as shallow as positive thinking if you live alongside people who struggle andor those in third world living conditions this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion
