i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at air as it was know as back thenthank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i dont have to sit through the whole thing it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey the pay was goodattention to detail was not a strong point for this one but who was going to knowthe funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speeda lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and timebut every one was having such a good time who cared
