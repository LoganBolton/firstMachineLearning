ive been scolded and scorned by fellow christians for stating my disappointment with this movie i get hounded by statements like these i cant believe you didnt like it it was made totally by christians everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie it was made by a church and not hollywood we should spend our money on movies like this they only used 100000 to make the film this is by a real church and christian school in georgia a preacher wrote and directed it so apparently the reason i should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by christians that is all that is needed for me to love the moviebr br look i got the movie without knowing anything about the background of the film i had never heard of it and had no idea  other than football  what it was about i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax dont worry there have been other cheap movies and other expensively made movies that have earned less respect from me it isnt about the making of the movie it is the end productbr br the writer acknowledges that god doesnt say yes to everything we pray for in the way we want but he wanted to show by having faith god changes our lives that is true however god can change our lives and were still infertile god can change our lives and we dont get a raise from our job god can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy god can change our lives and our house is still stinky why didnt he portray that in the movie others voiced their concern to the writerdirector over the matter but apparently he was defensivebr br i did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots i like the idea of going to god and recognizing his awesome power and our weaknessbr br the writing and directing were very weak it is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development all we really get from the coachs wife is she is not pregnant well until the end of the movie it seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into i have a cripple father and i cant play football well but ill kick the winning field goal even though ive never kicked a real field goal before another problem was the christian school itself umm i have worked for two christian schools went to one myself and have had many nieces and nephews in other christian schools all in all ive had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones none of the problems that i have seen in all of these schools were addressed i saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor it would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how god can workbr br i will close by stating that every work  either written or drawn or played on an instrument  shares the artists world view the world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of people who pray the right way win ball games get new cars conceive when they couldnt get a raise and get their house fixed  all within a short time span i know i should love the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason
