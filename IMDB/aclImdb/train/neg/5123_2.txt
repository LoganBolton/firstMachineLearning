its interesting how 90 of the highvote reviews are all comprised of random username from united states no state pride who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies i would delve further into this suspicious trend but alas this is a review of the movie and not the reviews themselvesbr br let me start by saying that i am both a christian and a true avid movie fan this means i have seen a great many movies from good to bad and can wholeheartedly claim that facing the giants is in fact not a good movie it has good intentions but fails to meet many if any basic standards that i associate with a quality filmgoing experiencebr br the acting mostly terrible palatable at best hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise mebr br the dialogue clumsy cheesy the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit youd see performed in sunday school or youth group function the rave review robots revel in the absence of meaningless words but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world and the complete absence of it is palpable lets just say the mean ol head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than oh no when things are not going his waybr br the plot mindbogglingly predictable it has been commented that this movie is not a hollywood clich√© and yet its like it was pulled directly from making an underdog sports movie for dummies including the mandatory quasiromantic subplot for the ladies and just had a christianthemed coat of paint slapped on it im not lying or bragging when i say i had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented herebr br the directingediting it too was patterned almost exactly after the generic underdog sports movie template still acting aside there werent many noticeable goofs so at least facing the giants was technically competentbr br the message ask jesus and he will grant all your wishes part of me hoped that this movie would end in the teams eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole if we lose we praise you part because in the real world you will fail at one point or another and its good to be prepared for that but in the world of facing the giants if you fail clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating another interesting question being what if the eagles came across another team that had gotten religion would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and lastminute saves or would the universe simply have exploded br br the bottom line for the hardcore conservative christian parents crowd lamenting the evils of hollywood facing the giants will be another mediocreatbest christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern filmmaking for everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else and a warning any attempt to show this to nonchristians will lead not to conversion but to derision i give this two stars one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget
