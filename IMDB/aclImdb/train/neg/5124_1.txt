i watched this film in youth group where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it then some adult couple at a churchrelated christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance and now my household is stuck with the film though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap i cried bitter tears over these sad events and heres why first off this film has good intentions especially if youre a christian like me this movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in god and that itll make your life better not so bad right eh it turns out a be a problema big one this movie was made by a church so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for christians as possible it is all blackandwhite no gray areas gods grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing and it comes instantly to all those who do his biddingbr br this is not the god i know this is not the christian life i am familiar with the god i believe in is a powerful and trustworthy god but he is not one that grants my every wish i follow him as best i can though the going is often hard yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and selfcontrol a lot easier than anyone should ever find it i cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from badside to goodside in the course of a few structured movie scenes and when i do follow his commandments as laid out in the bible i certainly dont find myself showered in blessing as these characters do the largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that i have done the right thing everything else comes with long messy arduous workbr br but take the example this movie sets grant taylor coaches the football team at shiloh christian school which has had 6 losing seasons in a row he may lose his job over it and he and his wife are low on money as it is they want a baby but the doctor tells him he is sterile oh and his car doesnt work and the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents whiny after their million losses and bad at kicking field goals this is sure one rundown community herebr br but wait grant taylor decides hes going to trust in god for everything and he passes on his faith to his team so far so good not for long as they begin to obey blessing literally pour in on them suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents the school has a big revival the team starts winning every game they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league coach taylors job is reassured the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present which by the way is the epitome of shallow fairweather employers he gets a raise his wife get this even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm and that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters wowzers woot yay praise the lord etcetera etcetera br br yipe just yipe nobody in my church has ever experienced christ in a such a cutanddry manner yes there have been miracles aplenty in my family as well as gifts and creature comforts and i attribute them to gods grace and lovingkindness but god isnt some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad he is by and large a mystery his gifts come unexpectedly often when you think you dont need them but you really do its a long hard slog to the road of fulfillment and things never turn out the way you thought they wouldbr br this movie has good intentions but because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism it tanks tremendously to a 110 the bad acting and sports movie clich√©s seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushesbr br to all you future churches planning to make a movie dont be afraid to show real life even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix however much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat nobody has learned anything substantial from it give us the meat the bones the real stuff true life applies to everyone not just christians and thats one aspect facing the giants didnt manage to grasp
