as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie then i watched it the acting wasnt the best thats forgivable its the message thats not give jesus your life and everything will change  youll tackle better make amazing catches stop fumbling start making touchdown passes and even make the playoffs all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into allamerican athletes i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals but wait thats not all youll get a brand new truck a 6000 raise and you and your wifes struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy  twice then youll win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than hes ever kicked before  and into the wind no less  all because god wanted him to make it then youll win the state championship again the next year none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadnt chosen to follow jesus will all their heartsbr br heres what i took away from the movie god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it  and its all about making our lives better easier and more enjoyable he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games which bible is this story based on ill bet saint stephen wished hed known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus it would have saved them all a lot of trouble
