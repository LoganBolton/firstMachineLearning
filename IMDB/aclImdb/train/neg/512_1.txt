it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films id like to argue that instead of banning challenging controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be stroker ace this film is awful with a capital a it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in quite a feat for for a man with cannonball run ii cop and a half and rentacop on his cvbr br the waferthin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace reynolds a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle ned beatty the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are lugs jim nabors aces dimwitted pal and pembrook feeney loni anderson a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by acebr br hal needham the director of this lowgrade garbage was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chasesraces some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts unlimited but with stroker ace he reaches a career nadir the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair the humour is weak and infantile throughout and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable even the outtakes during the closing credits which can be found in all the reynoldsneedham collaborations are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasnt much fun to make stroker ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude
