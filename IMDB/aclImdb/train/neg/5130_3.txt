janeane garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film calling it among other things antifeminist she has also said on her radio show she hates making romantic comedies because she doesnt believe in them i wholeheartedly agree with janeane here this film is a trifle at best she does her best but overall it was just another boring unbelievable romantic comedy that has no basis in the real world whereas there will be some who will say suspend your disbelief one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from hollywood janeanes character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness which makes her look unattractive while umas character is filmed in lighter tones which probably displeased janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film that really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two as many have said here and on other comment threads janeane is not ugly but in fact quite beautiful i havent read one review where someone said uma was better looking having said that though i believe that ben chaplins character would more than likely stay with uma not janeane many men dont like really intelligent women and many women dont like really intelligent men and sadly ben probably would have stayed with uma and despite the directors attempt to make janeane unattractive it doesnt work her natural beauty comes through anywaybr br i think a lot of janeanes male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the ben chaplin character and actually scoring with janeane janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here real life is always much more complex than hollywood can imagine so take a cold shower gentlemen this is the role that janeane is best known for and thats a shame as this really isnt that good of a film
