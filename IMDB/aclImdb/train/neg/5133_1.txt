i had no real expectations going into this movie and im glad even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been disappointedbr br where to start first i think 15 of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark junglefield i get it theres scarecrows i think the title scarecrows was sufficientbr br second not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences theres too many times where i was left going wtfbr br third the movie takes itself seriously im all for a bmovie with buckets of blood screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse but those movies often know theyre bmovies and even flaunt it like dead snow hilarious scandanavian zombie flick or evil dead 2 but this movie seems oblivious to its crapdombr br finally there should of been more blood andor nudity yea i said it if youre going to have a crap horror movie make with the killing and if youre going to have one hot and one semihot girl one of them needs to show some sideboob at a minimumbr br so like the summary says skip scarecrows and just poke yourself in the eye youll thank me
