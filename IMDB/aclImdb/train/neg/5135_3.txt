i think scarecrows are creepy so its a pity this movie doesnt make more of them br br a bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive when they move on the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows it is as alfred hitchcock says a bomb under a table goes off and thats surprise we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and thats suspense
