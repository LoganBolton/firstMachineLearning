i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it well i cant imagine anyone liking this movie because its just bad bad badbr br its obvious that whoever made this movie doesnt know a single thing about horror the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows the two genres automatically cancel each other out because first theyre criminals and who cares about criminals and second because theyre stupid criminals to boot having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesnt work here wheres the horror in that i wanted the criminals to die horrible painful deathsbr br but the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres which could have been original if handle well never gels were simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible tv like and worse offense of all whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if were watching some sort of radio show this part was really bad the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea i cant tell you how annoying that wasbr br as ive already mentioned the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid for instance when someone suddenly shows up gutted and filled with money and straw yep straw in his huge open wound the others ask what drug is he on after they shoot tons of bullets in him unable to kill him hes been zombiefied by the scarecrows dont ask get a freaking clue morons ive never seen such stupid people in a movie and then theres the girl i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting even though the criminals couldnt have done it what a dimwit she was but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick theyre not scary nothing much is explained about them theyre just a plot device in this plot device filled moviebr br mr wesley filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop doesnt elicit anything but sheer boredom and that scene with the talking head in the fridge thanks for the laughterbr br all in all this had to be one of the worst movies ive seen recently and ive seen a lot of movies these days between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows id rather watcher silo killer again yep scarecrows is that bad
