burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions hed show up party with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck it didnt seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crapbr br no film epitomized this more than stroker ace which makes cannonball run look like a classic and cannonball run ii look watchable save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde its embarrassingbr br if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it wont be any worse
