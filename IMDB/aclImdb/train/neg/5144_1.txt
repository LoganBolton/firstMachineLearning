the orange tone to everything was just yucky oh yeah the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orangetinted with orangetinted people meanwhile to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body she plays a fullimmersion video game which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay she apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company lots of nonspeaking pauses later the story drags on slowly she uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and i can only suspect a microsoft future releasebr br meanwhile i the viewer ask basically why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life oh yeah playing games is fun but what is the point when youre almost starving while she is piddling her life away playing some lousy evenmoreorangetinted lame fullimmersion video game her dog runs off probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention to it and feeds it regularly or is stolen from the woman while she is ignoring her lousy orangetinted realitybr br meanwhile she obsesses over some game her gameplaying team lost the entire uninteresting movie yawn so she wants to be the best of the best go get them ash catchem got to bore us all golly this main character sucks as a human being as well and has no redeeming qualities aside from her physical beauty which she could barter for some manner to escape her crushing povertybr br so she reaches the real level and it at least not sucks horribly and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate mentally living in the real level finally the sucky boring bland orangetinted movie is no longer a tedious chore to watch but has the potential to say something along the lines the main character is trapped in imaginary computergenerated poverty and she is actually in the real world now perhaps she will do the murder deed and live in the real world now well she kills the guy and he vanishes in a digital effect wow thanks idiotic director you suck you suck so very much directorbr br here the director had an iota of a chance to redeem himself slightly by burying this lousy lame moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twistbr br the director could have said the real world is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to make it better it wont be some cruddy orangetinted poverty land a clever way to make this sucktacular movie a agonizingly slow lesson on basic civic pride for the 1 of the viewers that havent found something actually entertaining to watch at this point or are moviemasochistsbr br nope director the director had to screw this all up by tossing in some cruddy digital effect and ruin all chances of redemption for this awfully lousy movie which was a waste of money a waste of time and a waste of viewer trustbr br after that it ends good riddance i hope the director chokes on it im putting this hack on my avoid at all costs list for any other films his name is attached to
