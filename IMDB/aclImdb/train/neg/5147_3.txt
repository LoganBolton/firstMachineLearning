blue desert may have had the potential to be even a halfway plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character lisa roberts courtney cox not been so stupid when she is the victim of another attack on the streets of new york comic book artist roberts moves to a small town out west in her first days there she meets the suspiciously crazy randall atkins craig sheffer playing this part well who will eventually not leave her side fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop steve smith db sweeny whos character does not seem convincing enough leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers smith needs roberts cooperation because as he tells her atkins is an excon and guilty of sexual assault but the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away beforebr br the movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough there is such confusion as to whom roberts should trust however much of the intended suspense appears too forced because roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might and her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly particularly in the finale perhaps sweeny was the wrong choice for this role too baby faced in ways that kind of recall kevin andersons persona evident in his character in sleeping with the enemy or if lisa roberts was written as a stronger character this might suffice as well in the meantime the film is not all that great even as a lowbudget bthriller
