i thought this was a great idea but boy was it poorly executed we do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are but virtually no specifics about any of it works the producers dont seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a throughline which is not to say they didnt try but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the ring cycle as the programs narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an operabr br we see lots of things happening but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why theres little sense of who is who or how the various production departments fit and work together for instance several times we hear about a problem of some sort  one expects then to see the problem and its consequences andor how it gets resolved but instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else generally pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets br br overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that youd see run under the closing credits of a show rather than anything worth watching for its own merit
