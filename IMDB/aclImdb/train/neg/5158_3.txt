sometimes making something strange and contemporary doesnt always work to everyones advantage while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didnt work this film was so hideously slow and pointless not even robin williams could save this garbage its obvious barry levinsons dream fell flat on its face but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop
