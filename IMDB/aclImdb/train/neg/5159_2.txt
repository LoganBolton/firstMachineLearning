watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfactionnonebr br the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil so how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly its because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoevermuch like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasnt enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade schoolbr br the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on i really am unsure why it was made in the first placeit certainly wasnt made to provide any sort of entertainment
