ridiculous fluff that compounds its error by trying to have meaning joan this time as a congresswoman agatha reed chairwoman of a committee dedicated to investigating the high cost of food says congresswoman reed the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long im going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant shes all business but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night the parallel to joans real life is unmistakable here as it is in all joan movies the degree causes much consternation on campus that would make it the most broadminded institution in the history of education  but joan is unaware of this as she arrives the college president jim merrill played by robert young at his handsomest happens to be joans former teacher  and lover it was with him that she spent the night out all those years ago but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married naturally this highprofile event will be covered by life magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be yet another of joans old lovers  this one she hung out with in china during the war and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame eve arden playing joans assistant woodie is at her butchest and most smartalecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job if you didnt like her so much but you not only like eve in this as in all her roles you adore her she is so droll and nononsense youd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater eve tells her it looks fierce but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings she joan sees youth  herself at 18 eager expectant  a little frightened asking what is life what am i but of course if we actually go into depth about joan at 18 the truth may be a little different br br for me this is the major problem in watching any joan movie you can call her characters whatever you want to but its always all joan all the time so since what were always seeing is joan being herself its easy to dispense with characters names its just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 joan had already been around the block several times many men would have described her as eager and as far as being expectant she had already had several abortions at this point but thats a personal problem and i digress but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as and then joan does this or that or we see joan as when we are not literally watching a home moviebr br there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks it fails what also fails is an attempt at early50s political correctness in the story joan has written a book about free speech and made a film no not the one about the plumber and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical dr pitt who is about to be fired for his views which are shockingly similar to joans this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one to be sure but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion
