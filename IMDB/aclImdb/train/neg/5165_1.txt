i was looking forward to this ride and was horribly disappointedbr br and i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park ridesbr br the roller coaster part was just okay  and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride br br it was visually dull and poorly executed br br it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland and failed in every aspectbr br it was not thrilling or exciting in the least
