just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the thing in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be tellingbr br for me this just didnt come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking something it never really is it doesnt help that the final revelation is less a scare then an oh as on oh thats it maybe if i hadnt been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldnt have compared it to so muchbr br id take a pass
