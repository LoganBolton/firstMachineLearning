when i saw this at a shop i thought it looked really good and original like wolfs creek meets texas chainsaw massacre and i mean it only cost three quid around 6 to be honest i dont think it was even worth thatbr br it seemed like the directors the butcher brothers couldnt decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror it ended up with a clich√© ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldnt care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasnt neededbr br the only good part really was the middleend i wont ruin it for you but that was the only good partbr br overall a pointless watch it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes if you want an artsy filmdont bother if you want a slasher movie dont bother the film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening
