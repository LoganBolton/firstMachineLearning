the hamiltons tells the story of the four hamilton siblings teenager francis cory knauf twins wendell joseph mckelheer  darlene mackenzie firgens  the eldest david samuel who is now the surrogate parent in charge the hamiltons move house a lot franics is unsure why is unhappy with the way things are the fact that his brothers  sister kidnap imprison  murder people in the basement doesnt help relax or calm francis nerves either francis knows something just isnt right  when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same againbr br cowritten coproduced  directed by mitchell altieri  phil flores as the butcher brothers whos only other film directors credit so far is the april fools day 2008 remake enough said this was one of the films to die for at the 2006 after dark horrorfest or whatever its called  in keeping with pretty much all the others ive seen i thought the hamiltons was complete total  utter crap i found the characters really poor very unlikable  the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over its 85  a half minute too long 86 minute duration the theres the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud theres this really big sustained build up to whats inside a cupboard thing in the hamiltons basement  its eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy is that really supposed to scare us is that really supposed to shock us is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll is a harmless looking young boy the best twist ending that the makers could come up with the boring plot plods along its never made clear where the hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work except david in a slaughterhouse  i doubt that pays much or why they havent been caught before now the script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror  it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective a really bad film that i am struggling to say anything good aboutbr br despite being written  directed by the extreme sounding butcher brothers theres no gore here theres a bit of blood splatter  a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you couldnt do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup  a camcorder the film is neither scary  since its got a very middleclass suburban setting theres zero atmosphere or mood theres a lesbian  suggest incestuous kiss but the hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale  theres not much here for the horror crowdbr br filmed in petaluma in california this has that modern low budget look about it its not badly made but rather forgettable the acting by an unknown to me cast is nothing to write home about  i cant say i ever felt anything for anyonebr br the hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull  boring from which it never recovers add to that an ultra thin story no gore a rubbish ending  characters who you dont give a toss about  you have a film that did not impress me at all
