this is so bad so very very bad the acting is the biggest joke in history dont even bother to see it i did ff it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning i really dont understand peoples taste im a horror movie fan and im not fastidious but i do have a limit maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of the hoast but thats it so i recommend you dont waste the 15 minutes youll be able to watch i mean the acting is better done by monkeys and the big brother with the parental role is just awful dont they pay characters in cmovies no i must say its not the first time i think a horror movie is bad but its absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with portrait of a vampire cabin by the lake the hoast
