without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling unoriginal elements party of five gone maniacal then genetically unescapable theres little rooting interest because the singular nonhomicidal element is a secondrate bland awfulacting wes bentley mopester in fact all of the acting is skin deep even though the darkhaired women appeal the salaciousness is kept to a minimum no nudity here also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood all sensations are kept at a teasing safe distancean unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is butcher only the soundtrack the droning angsty altcountry and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing lowangles that adds to the malaisebut for a film that calls itself horror i did not even get close to flinching once perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square and a sustained focus on playfulness through the familys maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest
