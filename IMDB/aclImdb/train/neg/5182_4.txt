like most of the festivals entries hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution although impressive for its obvious low budget the film falters in its final twist and becomes dreadfully long during its drawn out and obvious conclusion the film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died they kidnap people  drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement theres some nice darkly humorous performances from mckellhar and firgens and the rest are just soso the film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter but for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment the next half isnt so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap its a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every levelbr br 5
