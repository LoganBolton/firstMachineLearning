this is the first of these 8 films to die for collection that ive seen and its certainly not made me want to see any of the restalthough ive heard at least a couple of them are decent i dont know this wasnt terrible but it didnt really do much for me your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing mom  dad died the family sold the farm  moved to san francisco  where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible the best part of this was the creepy goth sister who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves anyway of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on this family is sort of like the whitebread version of the sawyer clan theyre nasty  they do bad things but they aint go no soul i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this and i guess i dont know what i missed but i found it to be very mediocre  i wouldnt recommend it to anyone really 4 out of 10
