im not going to approach and critique the theories of raw i mean this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is wellmade and not a site debating philosophybr br having said that this video really blows its one talkinghead shot of raw after another some of it is archival video so you can see how he has aged over the years and thats pretty cool but otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonousbr br its a strange comparison but i kept thinking of the sunday afternoon when i watched some of the barbra streisand star vehicle funny lady another really bad movie after a while i was so odd on barbra i kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldnt appear in you know a meanwhile other characters in the movie were up to something else moment but it was all about barbra well this video is raws funny lady br br so if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of raw while he prattles on with his theories assembled in a lame structure that doesnt add any interest or insight then be my guest for me i couldnt take it after 20 minutes
