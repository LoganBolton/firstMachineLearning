this series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing made ian mcshane code name diamond head instead of code name tree diamond head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue which mcshane proved he could do with the lovejoy series roy thinnes the actual diamond head is really only soso in the role mcshane is not really that good as the bad guy tree france nuyens character tsotsing cant seem to make up her mind as to whether shes the hapless victim or the toughandreadytofight woman she really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of diamond heads lover after viewing an episode or two i ended up not caring what happened to anyone tree gives us a lot to hate him but diamond head gives us nothing to like him unfortunately the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960s
