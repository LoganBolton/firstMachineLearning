think of this pilot as hawaii fiveo lite its set in hawaii its an actionadventure crime drama lots of scenes feature boats and palm trees and polyester fabrics and garish shirtsit even stars the character actor zulu in a supporting role oh there are some minor differences  roy thinnes is supposed to be some frontline undercover agent and the supporting cast is much smaller and less interesting but basically the atmosphere is still the same problem is hawaii fiveo another qm product already existed at the time and had run for years it filled the market demand for hawaiibased crime dramas quite adequately code name diamond head may have been intended as the hier to h50 as the older series eventually dwindled awaybut it comes across as a superfluous 2nd rate copy it doesnt suck but its completely derivative and doesnt do anything as well as the originalbr br there is some decent acting talent involved here thinnes is an old pro and he gives the role his best shot and he isnt bad but thinnes is only as good as his material and his director ian mcshane is in here as an evil spy master named tree and mcshane tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in but hes phoning his part in here frances ngyuen is reasonably exotic looking but her astounding skinniness opaque features thick accent and wooden delivery arent the stuff of which dreams are made relying on her to supply the romantic interest for thinnes was probably the series biggest mistake at least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with marsha brady and peggy lee as our love goddesses give her another 30 lbs and a year with a dialogvoice coach and she might cut it zulu is well his usual self  enjoyable in bit parts but he isnt a person who can carry a feature by himself br br in addition the plot and dialog are strictly bythenumbers with nothing to distinguish them from any other quinn martin production and by this point the american tv audience had seen a whoooole lot of qm productionsi think cn dh was one too many and it sank without a trace it wasnt the really the actors fault and i hope they walked away from this with a decent paycheck and one more entry on their cvs br br mst3000 revived this for their treatment in their sixth season and they had a lot of good natured fun with it worth seeking out in that version if you enjoy the mst approach to movie japery and lampoon but i cant imagine anyone caring about this pilot for any other reason
