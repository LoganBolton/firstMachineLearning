it doesnt take long to see why code name diamond head didnt make it onto the network schedules the tv pilot movie doesnt get past the credits before its obvious just how bad its going to be maybe i missed something because the plot didnt make a whole lot of sense based on what i got out of the muddled mess a terrorist or thief or something named tree ian mcshane goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon the worlds dullest secret agent johnny paul roy thinnes is out to stop him there might have been more but trust me  it really doesnt matter anywaybr br action movies should have action suspenseful moments should have suspense and dramatic moments should have drama theres none of that in code name diamond head ive seen others use the word turgid to describe this made for tv snoozer  and its better than any one word description i can come up with none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about and roy thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable his charisma is just slightly north of a slug ian mcshane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it but unfortunately for everyone else involved it doesnt appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member now if mcshane had been cast in the series lead well then you might have had somethingbr br im quickly discovering that these gawd awful 70s madefortv movies make great mystery science theater 3000 episodes and that goes double if quinn martin was involved very funny stuff from mike and the bots so while i may only give the movie a 310 i rate episode 608 a 45 on my mst3k rating scale
