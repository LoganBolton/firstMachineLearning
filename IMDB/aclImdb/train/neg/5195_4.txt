i had heard and read so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series like entourage sopranos or mad men but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one didnt make it past the first six episodes br br the writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing the dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip  it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laughbr br the characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing i absolutely hated the addition of the brotherinlaw who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator and the removal of the hodes daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clich√© i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewers loyaltybr br episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldnt get past many of the technical flaws in the story linebr br add to that i heard that season two wasnt as good so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play outbr br if youre a fan of good casting and writing i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course youre stoned and then all bets are off
