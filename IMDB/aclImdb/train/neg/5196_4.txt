though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series bulldog drummond escapes this is a weaker escapade in both a plot thats less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesnt have the charisma of ray millandbr br that said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying also john barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguisesbr br anyway its another endless night for bd as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining
