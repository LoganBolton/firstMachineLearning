this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but i really cant recall when ive seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the conflict card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown inbr br possible spoilerbr br the 40orso minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end br br avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflictbr br
