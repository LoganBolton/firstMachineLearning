this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and meanspirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonists character was as slimy as they come the sickroomhothouse atmosphere lent itself to overthetop theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately ive been to spain and realize this is not realistic in addition the use of samesex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their rolesas if they were trying to distance themselves from this messi guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killedthis film might especially appeal to you
