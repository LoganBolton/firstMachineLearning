trigger man is definitely the most boring and silliest movie ive ever seen in my life my aunts holiday videos are more fascinatingbr br the actors seem to be recruited at uglypeoplecom they do not have any talent to act in a convincing mannerbr br they walk and walk and walk through the forest theres more walkingaround than in all three parts of the lord of the rings together after the first hour i began to read a porsche brochure while watching trigger man along the way awfulbr br a total waste of time and money id give that movie 0 stars out of 10 since this is not possible i have to give 1 star
