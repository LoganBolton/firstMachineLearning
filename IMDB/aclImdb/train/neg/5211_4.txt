ha without a doubt tommys the evil one here i dont know why but for some reason little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches and since theyre kids they wont die because theyre annoyingwellexcept for asylum of terror but those are few and far betweenbr br anyway onto the movie cant find this movie on dvd sure you can all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for 15 but you also get 49 other movies what a bargain pff ok im done advertising for these cheesy movies lets just say this movie aint worth the 15 bucks on its ownbr br so we have a chemist scientist yeah cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter hes trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 34 of the moviebr br to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she was never married scandalous but of course tommy is one of the most irritating charactersno i take it back he is the most irritating character far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peters work and gloats over him while hes in the hospital thats right even as an old cripple you can still be the villainbr br so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes hes the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal however at the end he ends up deevolving into a lizard yeah i know dont ask the ending really doesnt make any sense and if youre hoping for any really good payoff youre not going to get itbr br this isnt a horrible movieits just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list youre not in for a snoozer but youre also not in for a great movie just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food because this movie isnt going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soonbr br metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10
