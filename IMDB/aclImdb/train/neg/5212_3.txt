i unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a mill creek collection and one night i just decided to watch it though not expecting much as the beginning credits roll around im surprised to discover this film was made under the filmirage company filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as troll 2 ator the invincible and quest for the mighty sword so i was compelled to watchbr br as the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent even though it was unoriginal the gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent but after a while into the film the pace started dragging and i found myself thinking okay someone better get killed soonor someone better mutate at the onset of this drag when i was having these thoughts though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated however as noted the gore and effects werent very good what made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing example first dr houseman would be at the zoo then hed have a flash back about possibly killing someone finally hed wake up in a cold sweat in bed making the audience ask was he dreaming he was at the zoo like the movies pace these scene transitions got progressively worsebr br i could try to say the character development of dr houseman was pretty good but towards the end of the film that is once youve seen what the doctor has metamorphosed into hopefully youll laugh which really is the only reason to see this movie at least once this movie unintentionally runs like a longwinded jokebr br the costume of the um thing that doctor houseman becomes can also be seen in joe d amatos quest for the mighty sword which was made in the same year youve gotta love filmirage movies theyre always reusing the same stuff
