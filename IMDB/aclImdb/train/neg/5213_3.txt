as others have mentioned this movie is similar to the fly both versions and the lesser known scifi flick altered states the big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it metamorphosis did not have these advantages metamorphosis is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the rolesbr br the story follows scientist dr peter houseman gene lebrock an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death when the university he works for threatens to cut funding he decides to inject the antiaging serum into himself as a result dr houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard and oh yes watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy it really is so bad that its good some of the lines are classic what was it a nightmarefrom the pastbr br many of the reviews that ive read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are im just going to go ahead and spoil it the good doctor goes from being a shuffling halfman halflizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected godzilla costume when the police finally gun him down in the final scene some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die and the movies heroine sally donnelly catherine baranov evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of dr houseman the camera then gives us a closeup of the lizards face this is i assume the directors way of showing us that the lizard is evil yes it is goofy but i fell over laughing so i cant complainbr br i watched this movie because it was a part of the chilling classics 50 movie megapack that i purchased im sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on dvd if you have recently bought the boxed set and havent watched this movie yet it really is worth your time even if i did just ruin the ending for you it might also be possible to find this movie online for free
