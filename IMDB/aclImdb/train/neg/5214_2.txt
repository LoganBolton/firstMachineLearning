metamorphosis i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and metamorphosis is the seventh movie in the set released in 1990 metamorphosis seems to be a remake of the atom age vampire which also featured a scientist striving for similar results set in modern times metamorphsis is not my kind of horror moviebr br a university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging pressured by the administration to publish his papers and produce some results or risk losing funding the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig at first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner br br the acting is stilted and the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film the score is pandering and the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious its absurd its ridiculous Â– at best br br as others noted the end turns into a 30 minute gag which is seemingly endless without giving too much away id call this one dr jekyll and mr hyde meet the creature from the black lagoon meets home alone
