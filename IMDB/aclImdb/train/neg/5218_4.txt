all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place dialog riddled with biological technobabble chintzy sets balsawood acting a horrific late80s casio score and an overall look that suggests anything on the scifi channels programming schedule circa 1993 though metamorphosis starts off with a lot of promise the film unravels into bland idiocy and mst3kstyle cheese as clark kent wannabe doctor peter houseman gene lebrock is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects but when he tests his vague experiment on himself he transforms into a vaguelydefined creature that bears more than a passing resemblance to dr freudstein from house by the cemetery the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously lowbudget production though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason but overall metamorphosis leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise i cant help but agree with one characters closing remark it was a nightmarefrom the past
