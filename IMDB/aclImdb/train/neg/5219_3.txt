metamorphosis hold a tiny bit of cultvalue simply because it was written and directed by george eastman this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe damato production during the late 70searly 80s wouldnt it be interesting for avid eurocult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around barebutted in erotic nights of the living dead all the time i thought so now unlike the movies he starred in eastmans own metamorphosis is kind of disappointing in the gore  sleaze departments there are a handful of nasty murders cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies a guest appearance by sleazequeen laura gemser on display but its mainly a talkative movie the handsome  eloquent dr houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process but if he doesnt come up with detailed reports any time soon his research will be stopped so dr houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins needless to say and like the title implies he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker in other words his research sucked like the other reviewers already mentioned this movie borrows a lot of ideas from david cronenbergs the fly Â– the dramatic romance sub plot included  but doesnt add any originality from its own the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff goldblums character in the fly whereas dr houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible the rapidageingsyndrome aspect also reminded me of ruggero deodatos sadly underrated giallo phantom of death only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didnt inflict it on himself the physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films though few scares or excitement to discover here instead the movie features loads of bad acting poor lighting lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot feel free to skip this one
