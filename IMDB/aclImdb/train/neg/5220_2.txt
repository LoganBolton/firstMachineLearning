a young basketballplaying professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging hes pressured into concluding his research because he hasnt published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him i thinkbr br he does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy shes the one who had been demanding results from the researchbr br initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened additionally he starts to appear very unhealthybr br since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else you wont believe your eyes  either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what hes turned into incredibly theres a further change in store  the end of the movie is really really absurdbr br about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it but she has a very small partbr br id once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main characters eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie im definitely getting rid of it
