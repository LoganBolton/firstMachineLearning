pretty awful but watchable and entertaining its the same old story if youve lived through the 80s vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the states ateam meets death wish my favoritebr br time goes on the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble no wait  in fact the friend is dead and it is his dad thats in trouble our first hero joey is killed by an exceedingly horrifying super pointy meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his fathers small store from the local protection gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war desperate for help the father talks to sarge the leader of joeys old unit from vietnam when sarge shows up for the funeralbr br well the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the old gang saddles up for the city you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the moviebr br the one thing that drove me crazy is that sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning and about how theyre really good at what they do when they plan ahead but joey wouldnt have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in vietnam in the first place if the unit hadnt been messing around then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs they do it again for no reason at all they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present phh i raise my hands in disgust foolishnessbr br there is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure its real every single one of them hmmbr br what are you going to do keep watching i guess the movie isnt too horrible to watch but it is a tease there are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening the most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie  the explosives in vietnam joeys death battle and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside poor teddybr br i guess my main beef with this movie is that i feel let down by it even the confusing subplots with mystery helpers and their bizarrely crosspurpose motives wasnt enough to save it at the end but someday maybe itll all come right and theyll make a sequel ha ha ha ha
