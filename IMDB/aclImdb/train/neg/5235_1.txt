i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this films link with the eighties but i really wouldnt say its an accurate depiction of most peoples lives in that era  even on the poorest bradford estates it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time plenty of righton artistry for small small audiences but enough wellconnected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience youll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in gregorys girl br br i would be tempted to call this a kitchen sink drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry however as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading filmgoers  i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it steer clear my friends it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates it isntbut it is grim do the washing up instead
