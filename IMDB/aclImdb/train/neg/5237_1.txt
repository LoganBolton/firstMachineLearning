one of if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s br br this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who seduces two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his fauxposh wife has nothing to redeem itbr br in turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial br br perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script its no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbars only work to make it onto the screen complete and utter rubbish on every level
