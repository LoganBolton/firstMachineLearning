i dont understand the positive comments made about this film it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got madebr br cartoon characters abound  sues foulmouthed alcoholic layabout irish father being a prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic  except briefly for sues asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are ive no idea why either rita andor sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob  but given that they do why should i be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is if that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on filmbr br i didnt like the film at all
