i watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that i read about it here by othersbr br they definitely saw something in this movie i didnt see thats for surebr br the movie starts off at a good pace and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting then it begins to get logged down and draggy not to mention completely unbelievablebr br eventually you find yourself saying what hes going to do that too just how far is he going to go with this thingbr br the plot begins with jeff goldblums character john going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine there is a robbery and a new store clerk auggie rose gets killed during the robbery br br john gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy this seems a little much but wait theres morebr br john becomes totally obsessed with auggie rose br br for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense john who has a very good life a beautiful loving girlfriend a secure wellpaying job nice house nice car expensive suitsdecides he wants to be a loser like auggie rose was and experience life in a low paying job living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous peoplebr br why this dimwitted halfbaked film got favorable reviews ill never know sure goldblum does a good acting job  he always does  and his looks have improved with age  but unless you have a big infatuation with jeff goldblum and have to see every film hes in i wouldnt recommend this turkey its approximately two hours of your life youre not going to get back  and believe me  youll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over other than being grateful youre not still sitting there watching this filmbr br
