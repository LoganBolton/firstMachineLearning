as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around  but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesnt fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own  its a neurological drama  it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a persons brainbr br its the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deafbr br no small feat for such a sort of a moviebr br the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage
