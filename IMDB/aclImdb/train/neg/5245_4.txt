i am a current asl student  was forced to watch this movie in class and what i got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film the film is obviously leaning towards to pov of the common deaf perception their is no middle ground also the film didnt make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic ie deaf people who were born hearing and later went deaf is it right or wrong in that instance the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w a capital d not that this is bad but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly unbiased
