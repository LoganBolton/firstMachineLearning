die sieger was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in germany i watched it last night and i must admit that i am deeply disappointed if that is supposed to be the last best hope for entertaining and challenging german action cinema well then there is not much leftbr br die sieger tries to be sexy daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind the characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected which doesnt happen too much the act against their nature that makes it hard  for me almost impossible  to follow them or even identify with thembr br most of all i think the film is very bad cast there is not one character in whom i believe maybe the superior officer at the swat unit  but thats about it those people that try to look like or act like special units like elite cops  i dont believe them not for a secondbr br the story is not so bad after all but i think its badly told you dont get to know the bad guy at all  for example and when after a very dark show down karl simon the good guy asks his already dead opponent why  what for i did ask myself that very same question knowing that dominik graf wouldnt have the answerbr br i sincerely hope  no  i believe that germany can do better even with action films
