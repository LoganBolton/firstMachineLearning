i absolutely adore the book written by robin klein so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the makingbr br but i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didnt capture what i loved about the book  the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way in which she views the worldbr br from the start of the movie i realised that things werent the same as i had imagined in the book so i just went along for the ride it wasnt all that bad i guess miss belmont was totally different to what i had imagined her to be i didnt think she would be one to smoke and drink  jean kittson who plays her is hilariousbr br on its own i thought the movie and its actorsactresses in it did a good job but alas im such a fan of the book one of my all time favourite books that i couldnt help but feel disappointed p
