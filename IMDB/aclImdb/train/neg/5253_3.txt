the name frau of the main character is the german word for woman i dont know if that was intentional or not but if sure got some giggles from the german audience at the fantasy film festival last year when it was shownbr br but those were the only giggles the movie got not that it was aiming for giggles its a horrible movie for heavens sake a horrible movie in more than one meaning its a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer definetely not for the faint of heart and it wasnt even necessary to show all the things that are shown im not even going into a moral obligation because movies dont really have that kind of task or function discussion of what is shown here but this is a new low on the whole torture movement that has grown in the last few years
