only minor spoilers except as notedbr br ive enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro whose superb devils backbone set in civil war spain was the finest horror film of the last decade its no surprise then that this film is both wellmade wellacted and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere but its also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to seebr br what actually is the purpose of all this we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voiceover are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence set more than a decade earlier we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and controlfreakery if i cant have you nobody can oddly enough that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree which appears completely different in both motivation and execution what happened to him in jail to cause this change we have no idea though we do later discover as an absurd sort of afterthought that he obtained a law degree while imprisonedbr br in britain in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases the terrible question arises what about the wife did she know or suspect what was going on this is a question that this film could have asked and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters but banally the answer to the question is quite clearly no she didnt even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate the film still manages to bungle it all we actually get sketched perfunctorily out at the end is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place where christies wife says you know what i mean thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horrorbr br major spoiler in this paragraph in the meantime we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again how exactly did he achieve this the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police but how this all works or why or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds remains a mysterybr br i actually dont believe serial killers are like this the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff but  lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right they are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply inadequate people not the creepily charming mastermind presented here closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie or indeed even man bites dog though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satirebr br this film has little suspense and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers either generally or in the specific cultural milieu of spain this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women and oddly what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory just one explicit shot properly timed would have been infinitely more shocking and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear very very creepy im sorry to be rude i love horror films and can tolerate even the most extreme to the extent even of worrying my partner but i think anyone who finds this film good or interesting even id find myself edging away from the purpose of a horror film is to scare you this is just lasciviousbr br it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed i have to give this film more than one star just because its competently executed but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made
