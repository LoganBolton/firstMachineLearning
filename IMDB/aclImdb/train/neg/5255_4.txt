visually speaking this film is stunning it has some delightful black comedic moments but on the whole the plot is very clich√©d as is its seeming message if youre a fan of overthetop violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw youll love it if youre looking for something at all highbrow steer away i saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06 and i only chose it because i was looking for something disturbing ultimately it isnt disturbing just grinding and unpleasant to sit through if you genuinely want to be challenged go see something like the lost if you want to be grossed out or tell your friends about a really messed up film then this is for you
