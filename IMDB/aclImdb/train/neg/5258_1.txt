well i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the familythen the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees etc etc etc they go to that town which no one know it exists blah blah blah and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you dont understand what is that moviei have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst honestly it doesnt have a description at all and i wish i didnt see it
