this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching everything was unbelievably clich√© and retarded the acting was horrible too the camera work wasnt bad but that still couldnt redeem it the writerdirector of this film must suffer from downs syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the kris kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled disappearances i dont know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least 20 for my time pain and suffering in conclusion the directorwriter of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street
