disappearance is set in the mojave desert as jim harry hamlin  patty henley susan dey plus their two kids katie basia ahern  matt jeremey lelliott along with ethan jamie croft a friend of the family are travelling along they stop at a roadside diner  ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called weaver noone claims to have heard of it but its definitely there  the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out  take some pictures once at the town they take some pictures  have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car wont start  they have to spend the night there while looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared the next morning  their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn what is weavers secret will the henleys ever leave there alivebr br written coexecutive produced  directed by walter klenhard i have to say that disappearance is one of the most frustrating films i have ever watched for the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller  horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history the script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms  i was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on from the families car mysterious disappearing the four recent graves the thing in the abandoned mines the supernatural sandstorm the sudden  unexplained disappearance of ethan  his just as unexplained reappearance the sheriffs sinister motives the compass in the car going crazy the crashed plane the townspeople denying weaver existed  the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near weaver in the 40s but they are all tossed out of the window  for all we know could have been totally separate random events everything was coming along nicely  was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming  instead i was treated to the most ambiguous strange surreal  downright frustrating ending possible if nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before  leaves the viewer with more questions than answers its almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didnt know what to do with them  just made the ending up on the spot i just felt i put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward  in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salutebr br director klenhard does a reasonable job here the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere  the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation its well made but what were they thinking with that ending nothing fits nothing makes sense  its just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour  a half leaves you confused  wanting to know more despite being a horror film theres no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here  there the film actually reminds of the hills have eyes 2006 remake for large parts as that is what the film is setup to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the filmbr br technically the film is good with high production values good special effects sets locations  cinematography set in america but filmed in south australia the acting is fine from a decent castbr br disappearance is a really odd film for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens  the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers i really cant see anyone making head nor tail of this i really cant
