a bickering american family vacationing in the west discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs and a deadly presence is stalking them i generally love mysteryhorror films like this cube spielbergs duel and the birds are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more apparently disappearance writerdirector walter klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer i personally think he got about half way there then the film just sunkbr br the actors are all kind of just hohum their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways is anyone else absolutely sick of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds at least give them some kind of justification for doing sobr br as far as madefortv films go its an above average fair for sure director klenhard should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking theres a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see i wonder if that was realbr br no gore to speak of and the creaturesor what ever the hell it is thats after these peopleare never shown not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are mutants aliens ghosts or ancient evil indian spiritsoh that really narrows it down for us or where the come from br br there are lots of clichés here too why is it that townsfolk in these kinds of films are always really really dumb why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct why why why how bout a new scenario folks br br disappearance tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways its too familiar to us fans of directtovideo horror fodder hey ive seen much worse films and disappearance aint bad its just too averagebr br 410
