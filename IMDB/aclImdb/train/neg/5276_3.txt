no this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach fairy godmother and the glass slippers but if i were to elaborate i would have to spoil it for you which i wont but dont let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic its one of those movies that start off promisingly before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline and thats real horrorbr br yoonhee to jiwon and hyunsoo shin sekyeong are your ideal mother and daughter ones a successful plastic surgeon while the other your dutiful obedient and beautiful teenage daughter their relationship is like hand in glove so close youd think of them more as siblings rather than parentchild but things start to go wrong dont they always when hyunsoos friends whom yoonhee has operated on start to go berserkbr br perhaps its a warning to audiences and for those koreans ladies who dont bat an eyelid when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed the only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow i thought kim kiduks time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itselfbr br its a tale of two halves the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which i admit did get to me now and then however the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbojumbo melodramatics and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably wont buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin withbr br the leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role but hey im not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously id recommend you to watch this only if youre a fan of mediocre korean horror on vcd watch out for those face offish moments
