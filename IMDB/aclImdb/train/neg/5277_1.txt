i caught this on showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful whos your daddy stars brandon davis as an adopted high school senior chris hughes a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun it is ruined by inept directing from firsttime director andy fickman a clich√©d and predictable screenplay and acting that is even bad by directtovideo standards even the normally funny charlie talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend ali landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud 110
