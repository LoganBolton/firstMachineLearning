when a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie i rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie we couldnt have chosen a worse moviebr br the movie may have been alright with a few changes first off the comedy was painful physical gags were poorly performed and placed the fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love if he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable there were some funny jokes i believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parents porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn but to best sum up the comedy i will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid he wears a puke stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is donebr br to finish off the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickeringbr br oh btw there are two good elements that the movie possesses kadeem hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or underappreciated the other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful mrs ali landry her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shamebr br dont waste your time even renting this one it didnt appeal to me and i was part of the target audience 18 male
