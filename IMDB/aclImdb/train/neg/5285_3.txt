somewhere on this site someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen one should simply read them i agree with that however we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers strike brings to mind that without good writers its hard for actors to bring their roles to life the current version of jane austens persuasion shows us what happens when you dont have a good foundation in a wellwritten adaptation this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters with the exception of the bizarre parade  kissing in the street scene in bath the 2007 version shows a twitty anne who seems angstridden the other characters were not very developed which is a crime considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about and mrs smith annes bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in bath   twittering away as many of the characters seemed to do the strength of character and the intelligence of captain wentworth which caused anne to love him in the first place didnt seem to be written into the rupert penryjones wentworth ciaran hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look than pj was able to do with his poses all in all the 2007 version was a disappointment it seemed to reduce the novel into a hand wringing costumed melodrama of debatable worth if they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into austens work they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare adapt it to the present at least bride  prejudice was taken out of the historical  locational settings and was fun to watch as was clueless this wasnt persuasion but they didnt know what else to call it
