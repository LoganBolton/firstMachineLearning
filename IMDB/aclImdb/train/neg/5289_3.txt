i love jane austens stories ive only read two of them pp and ss but after having seen this adaption im reaching for persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story and also because i refusing to believe jane austen could have written such nonsense for me i thought that if you base a film on a jane austen novel you cant really go wrong it will turn out great pretty much by default i was wrongbr br first of all where are the characters that you sympathise with and like you have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not deliver sure i wanted anne and wentworth to get together but only because thats what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together instead i had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the tv and to continue watching it to the endbr br anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end i really have no idea why wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to she was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone elses instructions rather than having a mind of her own this can still work for a lead character if you do it well this wasnt done wellbr br the other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which mary was the worst with a fullblown narcissistic personality disorder where mrs bennet in pp had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas mary was more of a freakshow more loathsome than funnybr br wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy for the most part of the story i was just wondering what kind of person he was and why hes in love with anne as surely hes the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more alive actingwise not too much to say as i reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how goodbad the people acting were anthony head was excellent but as soon as i saw he was in it i expected no lessbr br also found the story very confusing it wasnt until the end of the movie where it seemed as if elizabeth was not annes stepmother but in fact a sister im still not 100 on that the whole annewentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy they had been together but then broke up and theyre both bitter about it how come i was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone but it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow unimportant how can it be unimportant when its the very core of the story there was also a lot of namedropping but no real feel for who the characters were this louisa person for instance who was she a friend family what it wasnt made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another lady russell was there a lot but why mrs croft and wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as mrs croft looked old enough to be his motherbr br the final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but i didnt really think about it because i was too busy yelling get on with it already at the tv because annes lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met wentworths have some hesitation there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minutebr br then theres the issue of camera work as a regular movie watcher you dont pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it i didnt decide to do so here but i still noticed them to me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job a lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when theres a really important point to be made in this adaption it was overused and therefore lacked meaning the handheld feeling on occasion also didnt really work in a period drama the camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary not to mention the running itself this was the only austen adaption i caught in itvs austen season makes me wonder if its worth watching northanger abbey and mansfield park or if i should just read the books and leave it at that im sad to say this is a jane austen adaption i did not enjoy maybe ill watch the 1995 version instead the bbc are renowned for having done beautiful austen adaptations before after all
