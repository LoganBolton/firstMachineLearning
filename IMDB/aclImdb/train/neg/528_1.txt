i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel especially a beloved one like evening but when i saw that the books author susan minot was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film i thought that evening would be a good adaptationbr br if you enjoyed the book dont bother with this movie it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one anotherbr br here our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris harris is the son of the housekeeper buddy is a drunk in love with ann andor harris i dont think a single character made it from the book to the screen oh it just gets worst with every passing momentbr br and really didnt we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in to scenes of our heroes grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights simply does not work on film this film is a disaster skip it
