i cant recommend this film as a date movie gary oldmans semiautobiographical account of life lived on a south east london estate is a violent beckettian account of one of dantes circles of hell frankly at the centre of it is ray winstone who has done this sort of character before but never as well the film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar  thats all  and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration selfloathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie its an acting masterclassbr br of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and winstone is matched by kathy burke as his longsuffering wife who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour charlie creedmiles does an able turn as the fuselighting druggie son billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for gary oldman directs close up on the actors maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor 410
