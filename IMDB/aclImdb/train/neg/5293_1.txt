i picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had keanu reeves but after 5 minutes of watching i noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time its fake and not convincing it doesnt end there almost all the characters act so badly its laughable the only acceptable acting was by alan boyce david but the guy commits suicide early on and you dont see him again you never even know why he did it everything about this movie screams low quality i cant believe how such a thing gets released i was tempted many times to stop watching in fact i did half way through it i decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the imdb to check what others thought about it i found zero comments not surprised so i decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it the only good thing going for me was the highschool rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but thats not worth itbr br very bad acting and directing terrible movie
