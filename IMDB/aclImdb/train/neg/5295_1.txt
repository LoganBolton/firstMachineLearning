a teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide it leaves his family and his best friend keanu reeves asking a lot of questionsand blaming themselvesbr br good idea badly handled for starters this has been done before 1988mostly in tv movies and after school specials aside from some swearing and dialogue hence the pg13 rating this added nothing new the outcome is predictable and reeves attempts at acting were truly painful to watch hes good now but not in 1988 aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathybr br that aside the movie is dull i saw every scene coming and every surprise was telegraphed i basically couldnt wait for this thing to get overbr br i have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it it bombed badly it still looks lousy almost 20 years later the subject is worth handling but its been done better with better acting in countless other movies ordinary people comes to mind you can skip this one
