im not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre but even by the standards of lowlowbudget exploitation this one is really lame even on a nudityandgore level its incredibly boring there is some of both but its all sort ofmeh before the home video revolution it might not even have been released theatrically though it might have after all plan 9 from outer space played in theaters there is precisely one good and competentlydelivered line in the entire movie i assume they stole it from somewherebr br the acting is among the worst i have ever seen i mean even ed wood had a couple of competent actors and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy which can be fun to watch anyway most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate here those who dont read their lines like cigarstore indians sound like they learned them phonetically and this film does have one distinction it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie then laughably overplotted for the endingbr br update i should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception she is by no means wooden not that shes good but she certainly isnt woodenbr br even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness but with this one there doesnt even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage aboutbr br and you know the funniest thing they clearly expected to make a sequelbr br its so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way i sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it
