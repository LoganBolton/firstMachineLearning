it really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there this is by far not one of the worst out there still not a good movie but not the worst nonetheless go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst the film has decent camera work and editing which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher filmsbr br the film doesnt deliver on the onscreen deaths theres one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck but all other deaths are hardly interesting but the lack of onscreen graphic violence doesnt mean this isnt a slasher film just a bad onebr br the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements done in a tongue in cheek way for example after a kill charlie goes to the towns welcome sign and marks the population down one less this is something that can only get a laughbr br if youre into slasher films definitely give this film a watch it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers but not by much the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious you may forget the movie you may remember it ill remember it because i love the name
