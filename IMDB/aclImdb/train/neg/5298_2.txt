i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no ones heard of and could be a possible gem i saw this and since im a fan of violence and gore i got it it got the rating of em which means extremely mature thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else i got it the warning on the box said extreme violence extreme langauge and nudity the extreme violence struck my fancy the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick it had one or two gory scenes but ive seen worse in a pg13 movie of course the amount of gore in a movie isnt all that counts right you have plot also well the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it dont rent it i speak the truth i cant imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say im gonna rent that again it had its moments where it kept you going but im never going to see that film again
