this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing  characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes  musicians cant be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast  some greatlooking sets  costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life shell end up  shudder  alone i felt queasy i cant believe this movie made it to theatrical release its the sort of fare one expects from those womens cable channels that i always pass right by when channelsurfing i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this films target audience but boy does evening miss its target
