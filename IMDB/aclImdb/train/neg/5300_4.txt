im one of the millions of columbo addicts all over the world and just watched thisthe episode that started it all on british channel 5 it is fascinating to think what sprung from this soso movie and i can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of columbo and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous  classic series that said this particular movie is not as good as the rest except for the embarrassing final episode  the patronising british episode if columbo had been made as per the original pilot it certainly would not have gone on for very long or be watched and loved worldwide in this film lt columbo is smartly dressed drives a normal car has a partner doesnt talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive theres also none of the catandmouse chemistry between columbo and the villain watchable but only for the novelty of seeing how columbo started out
