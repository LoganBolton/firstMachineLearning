the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep engaging powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show among them is this film that is based off a very popular and wellacclaimed play the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation which comes as a doubleedged sword on one hand who better to translate the play than the original writer on the other hand who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense with a frustrating ending unnecessary dialogue questionable directing and of course the inability to provide substantial answers it is a growing trend among these highcaliber films to not answer all questions it provides and this has to stopbr br doubt is like a joke without its punch line like a book with the final 20 pages missing like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next doubt just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men doesnt really end it doesnt provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending yes that was the intent but this isnt a test of humanity its a copout i do not pay money to see an unfinished work i pay money to see a beginning middle and end and pray that i dont fall asleep during the three acts we are forced to become the writers of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each otherbr br this little drama is about a nun meryl streep who seems very sure that the wellbeloved priest philip seymour hoffman is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church the first africanamerican boy in the catholic church the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyones backs the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently which attracts the notice of a young teacher amy adams the story is set right after the assassination of john f kennedy which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each otherbr br doubts strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the everengaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over streep seems to be oscarworthy in every role shes in and here she is no different as her sternness and coldhearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church hoffman excels yet again as the priest by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers when these two argue you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched but lets not forget amy adams enchanted and viola davis law ad order for their superb job either doubts casting ensemble is among the best in 2008br br yet like previously stated its the writing and directing that ruins this film especially when dwindling down the third act questions pop up but they arent answered characters pop up but provide no real enhancement towards the plot kids behave different but we never truly find out why there are awkward angles in the cameraworkandtheres no actual reason why john patrick shanley the writer of the play had one previous film in his directing repertoire joe versus the volcano whether sheer arrogance or stupidity we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation utter annoying chatter that bores to no end there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted thanks to mr shanleybr br bottom line the lack of an ending is a stupid trend thats just as irritating as the seizureific camerawork in action films it doesnt matter that we have a great talented acting cast or decent cinematography or a good story being worked upon or good usage of sound and music because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesnt even finish the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate because we have the original madmen behind the projectbut he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and highprofile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end sideways cast away no country for old men burn after reading are a few examplesbr br newsflash end your stinkin movie please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank like walles depressing backstories instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness confusion and mental anguish have a beginning middle and the end please as a critic i prefer my films to be whole not incomplete doubt feels incomplete which is why it gets an incompetent gradebr br someone has to break this stupid trend
