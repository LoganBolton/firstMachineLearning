ok i am blessed i have seen two very strong stage productions the one in new york with the original cast and another at the san diego rep rosina reynolds and monique gaffney you rock compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable ive been plodding through the dvd for the past two evenings and am still not finished way too much extraneous dialog and waaay too many added scenes and people yes the four major performances are quite good esp ms streeps but comparing stage to film is definitely an example of less is more the thickening of the play to satisfy filmgoers need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice please please please go find a stage production somewhere near you
