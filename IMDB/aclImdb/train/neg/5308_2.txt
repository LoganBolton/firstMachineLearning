nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time its being brought to you by the neverinevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesnt click as science fiction its plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all thats nearly bare to resist give me a fing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didnt set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldnt make this one great id like to point out another film called the assault 1996 by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why topnotch 1stperson femme fatale action movies dont translate well in america sorry fellas
