i dont what that other review was talking about this definitely isnt a bimbo movie in fact i dont think there was one decent looking girl in it no its just cheesy poorlydone ed woodstyle science fiction schlock and its bad i cant even begin to tell you how bad it is i saw it late at night on cable and i was in shock the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow to me though the music tops it all a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone do not rent this thing but if you ever see it on cable watch it youll be amazed at how bad a movie can be
