intergalactic criminal kol ross hagen has been sentenced to death and awaits execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose but tonight theres going to be a jailbreak and kol flees on a convenientlyplaced escape pod and flies towards earth which apparently is nearby there he confronts a group of teenagers who look thirty and a game warden john phillip law who help protect him from his worst nightmare the bounty hunter and executioner android or more properly gynoid the alienatorbr br from the cover of the box i was confident this was going to be an awful movie but as awful as it turned out to be it was a ton of fun as well probably at least partially because i was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome the director fred olen ray who has specialized in making over one hundred lowgrade films most notably hollywood chainsaw hookers does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects bonus pj soles appears as tara obviously at a low point in her careerbr br sure theres plot holes why are there hillbilly rednecks in california allegedly los angeles county if i understood the warden correctly whats up with the space womans tacky blouse why is there a subplot about the ship captain forcefully trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere what the heck is quadrant 5 how does chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will shortcircuit an android yet land mines do virtually nothing why does kol look like a drunk native american football player with emphysema and the lund guy robert clarke does his character even have a point does the game he plays with the captain have a point does this movie have a point but the biggest mystery is the android or gynoid the alienator played by teagan clive what is an alienator why does it look like daryl hannah from blade runner only much larger because see if something is a cyborg its part human but if its an android its all machine this was an android so there was no reason to make it look human it could have looked like anything yet the person who designed her made her the size of a linebacker with david bowies hair and a leotard that shows me just a little too much if youre going to make a female android wouldnt the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in mission not accomplished they say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes but i think i found a huge exceptionbr br if mystery science theater 3000 were still around today this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get haranguedbr br beyond the buttnasty alienator sorry teagan female weight lifters are gross the film is alright maybe theres not much of a story and maybe the characters arent really very interesting and maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason  what use does a killer robot have with a deer but overall i actually liked the movie i wont be pimping it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest dvd copy which im sure is just packed with amazing special features  not but i consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future
