for the initial 20 minutes or so i was watching it on a ps2 so ive really no idea how long it took alienator sets up an interesting premise i dont think ive seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before however interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the alien is a huge bodybuilder woman in a steel bikini yes alienator is patently ridiculousbr br dont think i hold that against it in the world of shlockhorror patently ridiculous can often be a good sign however the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it alienator is funny as hell but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent setpieces by the time the movies finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on itbr br add to this the fact that the alien just kills people by vaporising them as opposed to doing any slashing as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot youll laugh at alienator but at it not with it if thats your thing then go ahead and check it out
