a singularly unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the thencutting edge rock n roll explosion with the middleclass sensibilities of a suburban sitcom the result is a jarringly dated mishmash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music but will at least keep their parents satedbr br a quick glance at the promo writeup on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content tom ewell is a drunken agent overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow hi honey im home the blurb sites him as so funny in the 7 year itch it sounds almost like an excuse what other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else it reads like so funny in the 7 year itch  but hes rubbish in thisbr br mansfield a beautiful girl with rumoured 50inch assets is unfortunately a bargain basement monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock her wooden delivery combined with ewells ott doubletakes make this a comedy partnership from hell for her part the sell gives us jayne mansfield whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the films biggest laughs as you can see a movie sold on the idea that its lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things most of this humour is men literally falling over themselves their glasses cracking upon site of mansfield etc only the freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its u certificatebr br for the musical side the most adenine of players are chosen would you really care to see eddie fontaine offer i love your eyes i love your lips they taste even better than potato chips in a song called cool it baby only the incendiary little richard breaks out of the mor though is forced to sing some of his more dadfriendly songs in a fourminute sequence and how come all the acts sing without a single microphone attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conceptionbr br technically the picture was quite advanced with special effects including a ghostlike julie london and deluxe color which now looks flat and artificial in fact with its reds that bleed and fakelooking flesh tones it resembles a colorised movie direction though isnt outstanding and the sound quality is also quite poorbr br perhaps it comes down to it being so old a time when men still smoked on screen sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance all of which happen here yet some like it hot the african queen ben hur and many many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today so the good at the time argument doesnt really stand up at its heart the girl cant help it is a cynical and patronising venture that doesnt bear close inspection 410br br
