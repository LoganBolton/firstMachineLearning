susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt im certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers im not one of thembr br ive seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijnbr br young mr rijn contributes the worst performance in the film in fact one of the worst acting jobs ive seen in a long time no wonder hes not gone anywherebr br i will say that seidelmans eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot but her work with her live performers didnt measure up im not sure she had that much raw material to work withbr br look fast and youll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustlerbr br if you like punk rock you might sit through this for the soundtrack ill stick to bing crosby
