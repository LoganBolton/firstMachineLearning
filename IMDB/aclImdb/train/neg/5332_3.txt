ok the portrayal of the stereotyped indians in this story is just plain wrong i do agree that elvis looks rather good here but yeah his skin color does seem to change during the movie i was thinking okhe was never that tan in real life its some of the most obvious brown indian makeup that i have ever seen its as bad as the indians on ftroop and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americansbr br this movie is ok but typically lame story and mediocre songs like in all of elvis later films he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible i keep thinking thank god that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out it is cool to see character actors joan blondell katy jurado lq jones henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie thoughbr br burgess merediths indian makeup is absolutely awful its the worst of the bunch for sure what were the filmmakers thinking was mr meredith doing this one just for the money or what i do love certain elvis movies though for example love me tender jailhouse rock viva las vegas i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv costars mary tyler moore and ed asnerchange of habit in which elvis plays an innercity doctorbr br oh well at least elvis made a few good films but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good onesbr br ill always love elvis thank you thank you very much
