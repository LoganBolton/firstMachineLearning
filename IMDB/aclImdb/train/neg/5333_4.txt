a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy elvis presley plays an indian bullriding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks desertspread in arizona where government suits have just invested in the familys herd of cattle which is in dire need of a stud what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages his social commentary isnt exactly pointed but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell the general wackiness gets way out of hand and theres too much hoopin and hollerin to sustain much interest as for elvis hes loose and frisky throughoutand while its nice to see him having fun onscreen one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point this shambles of a picture has a distinct whatthehell feel to it and though spirits are high the returns are mostly low 12 from
