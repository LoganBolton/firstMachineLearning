after a few lean years 1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis not only did he make that celebrated comeback tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  speedway and live a little love a little therefore personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away joe which at best emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering sure burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing  as respectively a dopey indian father to elvis character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr presley too  but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado as merediths mexican wife the two jones  henry and lq  and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is merediths stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day br br while there is a surprising if not unwelcome given their usual blandness lack of songs there seems to be no shortage of freeforall parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs as can be expected the typically western arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point on the other hand the climactic destruction of the house episode is one weve seen too often since and doesnt work too well here
