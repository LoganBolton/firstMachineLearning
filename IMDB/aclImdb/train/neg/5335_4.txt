its been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy and id forgotten just how idiotic it is id place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presleys very worst movies presley plays joe whitecloud a halfbreed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the brokendown shack where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez none of the three offer anything of substance  comically or otherwise the government has invested in the familys cattle but theyre lacking a bull elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs and is pursued by a young boycrazy gal and her guntoting mother this is just a real slapdash of a mess and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and dont make this much easier the one thing that puzzles me however is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film hard to believe considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies
