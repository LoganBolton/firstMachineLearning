theres so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just cant stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen heres a side you havent heard yetbr br elvis presleys movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i dont have to think when i watch them that means i dont have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easygoing rock n roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them allbr br in my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad its goodcategory now if youre like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate 1960s camp experience its so bad that its almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it cant possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end youre so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just dont know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because its so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it 1 out of 10 though  once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic
