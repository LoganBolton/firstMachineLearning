i knew that evening was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a chick flick but that your companion would survivebr br survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours  it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach  well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short filmbr br theres a monty python film about a knight who just wont die he ends up a wriggling why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt shes not worried about having been a wideeyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderessbr br obviously being a girlie film theres a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcyheathcliff character im not a woofter so i cant claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour hes a bloodless cypherbr br as you might gather the main characters arent much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse theres a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isnt the role of hamlet  why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girlfriend would have told him that facefungus didnt flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without itbr br i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery  if youre dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing youd expect in a beach cottagebr br apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action youd have thought that theyd have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldnt be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they cant know is nearby but we do as the audience if they dont have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the directors excuse is that it is supposed to be a halfremembered dream sequencebr br another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didnt think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties
