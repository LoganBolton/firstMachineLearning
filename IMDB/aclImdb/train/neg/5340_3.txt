spoiler alertbr br i love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an unbelievable role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but its convoluted unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away rene z tries hard with an underwritten part and so does patricia arquette the detective whose name i cant remember the one thats not chris penn is a big sweaty over actor see it if youre not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you cant follow it and so confusing you cant understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise rent the usual suspects
