i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times unlike other meyer films the sexual antics are down to a minimum some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadfulbr br the film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts its as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation blackploitation by having a higher moral message meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil however because they cancel each other out you end up with nothingbr br because it so bad in so many ways it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste perhaps because it is so bad we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable
