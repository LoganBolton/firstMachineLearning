this crap is like watching paint dry im so disappointed because i was so eager to see itbr br there simply is no meaning to this film if it were never made no one would notice or care its hyped up because of all the big names in it but if nobodys were in nobody would give this film any lovebr br seriously i was at the point where halfway through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think hurry up and die already this is like the joy luck club without any of the friggin joy its the oceans 13 nothing but a bignamed cast of motherdaughter movies and completely anticlimaticoh until its finally overbr br im sure theyll all be nominated for oscarsbr br  4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk
