yes talk about bad sequels rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the oncefunnyandentertaining honey i shrunk the kids the concept basically plays the same way as the first film but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore if you think this sounds interesting think again the movie is boring at best right down an embarrassment at worstbr br first of all the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis the actress playing his wife has changed the actors playing the kids have changed the ones playing the neighbors have changed you name it they try to make us believe this is the same family but the results are puzzling to say the leastbr br second the story is a rehash of the first one with not one bit of originality all the few jokes and theres barely any and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from honey i shrunk the kidsbr br third problem the special effects im sure this has been done on a smaller budget but they are pathetic way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series youre supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area but youll probably end up cringing most of the timebr br fourth problem to locate the action inside the house is just boring only few things happen and when they happen they are not thrilling at all the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature the grass and the bugs that live in it in this one the adults which come up as rather boring compared to the kids deal with dust a cockroach and a cockroach trap disgustingbr br i dont know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disneys executives except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new im warning you leave this tasteless cashin garbage where it should stay getting dust on the shops shelves
