i had the privilege of attending a special screening of the absence of light at a horror convention in ohiobr br first off you know youre in trouble when the director introduces a film saying now keep in mind we didnt have much money not that nobudget films are bad but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse the results are always poor and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleepfest br br actually absence of light marks a first in the world of underground cinema its the only time ive seen a dreamcast of talented genre vets actually bore me charismatic actors like david hess tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish nonames who are their characters what are they talking about who cares its all so dull youll cease to care about anything or anyonebr br after thirty minutes of this endurance test i gave up and walked out of the theater not surprisingly so did most of the cast members in attendance br br any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this with a little luck this movie wont ever see the light of day
