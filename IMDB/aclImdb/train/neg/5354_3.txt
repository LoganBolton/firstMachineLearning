absence of a good plot absence of decent acting absence of good cinematography absence of decent looking special effectsneed i go on review may contain spoilers the actors appear to be reading their lines and not very well at that most of the actors were acting like they were in a second grade play the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second gradersits not really all that convolutedits just so simple and dumb that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted nope its not its exactly as simple as you think it is i understood the film thats how i know that it stunk most of the film just had people sitting around talkingreading their lines trying to look sinister the narrator was annoying the special effects were laughable i love low budget movies i also like carolyn munro tom savini jack scarry and michael berrymorejust not in this movieyou can tell they werent getting paid or werent getting paid much because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it i love tony toddhowever he was only adequate in this movie in fact tony todds performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes seriously i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment if i had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this film i would have been pod and demanded my money back hopefully the people who made this will do better next time
