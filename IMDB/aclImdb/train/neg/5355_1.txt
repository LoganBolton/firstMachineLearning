now i dont hate cheap movies i just dont see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dads camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv  tapesbr br maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasnt maybe i hate it because its cheap has the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic characters ever and the really really really worst showdown in the history of films ever even tom savini cant save thisbr br seriously this one is a complete waste of time
