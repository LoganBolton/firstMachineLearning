i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it reminds me of a cgrade porn movie with one major difference no pornbr br the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable at the very least the pacing should have been picked upbr br while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it many of the action scenes were just pointlessbr br it was a complete waste of my time
