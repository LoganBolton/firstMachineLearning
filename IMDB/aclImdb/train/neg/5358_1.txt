its obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts well i dont know anyone involved and ive seen the final cut and it is pure garbage the only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends none on screen for terribly long its as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like tony todd tom savini david hess and michael berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks this is an ultracheap shotonvideo wannabe xfiles with terrible acting from a cast of nonactors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century there is little or no action its all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot ther computer fx are a joke but there arent enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way after about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking youll find yourself reaching for the fastforward buttonand not letting go absolutely worthless
