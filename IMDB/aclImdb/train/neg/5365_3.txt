private practice is being spun off the fairly successful and well written greys anatomy the cast is fabulous the premise might even work but the writing is just terriblebr br the prepilot disguised as a greys anatomy episode should have been my first warning the plot was just blah i thought maybe it was a fluke so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodesbr br as i was watching the pilot i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more theres supposed to be excitement flash great writing intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season amazingly this show had none of thatbr br thinking it was a fluke i just watched the second episode hoping for the best and although marginally better it doesnt come close to what it needs to be interesting cant miss tvbr br i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch not worth the effort imo and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season pass this one up folks
