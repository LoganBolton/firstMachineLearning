ive watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting considering medical facts that can be learned but this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the shows characters everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone even during office hours which is ridiculously unrealistic there doesnt seem to be one solid lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show  everyone is broken up and on the prowl  hardly a true reflection of all americans indeed there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and its truly fulsomebr br then we are presented with endless little moral dilemmas and theyre generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesnt agree with the allknowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice for instance in one of the latest episodes were presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because were supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupidbr br and i think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats prolifers addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds the general feeling was that if you opposed abortion youre a freak  hardly the popular sentiment in the us two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression whats more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in the script could have been written by planned parenthoodbr br all in all this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and farfetched medical situations throughout the whole show
