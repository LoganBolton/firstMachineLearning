i have seen every episode of this spin off i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is greys anatomy thus i have continued to watch im afraid the second season lacks the charm the chemistry and more importantly the drama of its predecessor greys anatomy the relationships seem contrived and the acting is soso the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived unfortunately pp is not so i loved kate walshs presence in ga im afraid kate walshs life in la is simply not interesting
