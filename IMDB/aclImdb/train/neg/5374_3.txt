the crimson rivers is one of the most overdirected overthetop overeverything mess ive ever seen come out of france theres nothing worse than a french production trying to outdo films made in hollywood and cr is a perfect example of such a wannabe horroractionbuddy flick i almost stopped it halfway through because i knew it wouldnt amount to anything but french guys trying to showoffbr br the film starts off promisingly like some sort of expansive horror film but it quickly shifts genres from horror to action to xfiles type to buddy flick that in the end cr is all of it and also none of it its so full of clich√©s that at one point i thought the whole thing was a comedy the painful dialogue and those silent pauses with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments made me groan i thought only films made in hollywood used this hackneyed techniquebr br the chase scene with vincent cassel running after the killer is so overdirected and overdone that its almost a thing of beauty the climax on top of the mountain with the stupid revelation about the killers with cassel and reno playing buddies like nolte and murphy in 48 hrs completely derailed what little credibility the film had by thenbr br its difficult to believe that the director of the crimson rivers also directed gothika which though had its share of problems doesnt even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked confused film
