the choke aka axe in the uk is a slasher produced supposedly as a straighttodvd movie i say supposedly because the title of the movie does not have the v in brackets to indicate that it was a made for dvd movie even though it does have the appearance of onebr br the plot is simple Â– a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by onebr br i think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece but this does not excuse the faults here even straighttodvd movies such as bachelor party massacre which has a very low imdb rating have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the socalled so bad theyre good movies however the choke falls far short of being either a serious slasher such as halloween or being a so bad its good movie such as the nail gun massacrebr br the movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill the blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget but from there onwards its downhill all the waybr br there are so many faults in the choke that i could spend all day talking about them but a few obvious ones stand out and ill go into thembr br the aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops there seems to be only around 8 people left and yet theyre all meant to be locked inbr br the characters in this movie are not likable at all most of the band members are aggressive foulmouthed morons or just downright weird no one really cares about what happens to them and even their supposed friends forget about them when theyve been dispatched the highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church seriously he spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason but sadly even his presence cant save the moviebr br there are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation as in other straighttodvd movies such as crocodile and grim weekend the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all there are plenty of overthetop outbursts mainly from the male characters and one nearly results in a fullblown fight in fact the format could be said to go as follows characters walk aroundmurder takes placecharacters walk aroundmurder takes place you get the ideabr br the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the fword being used perhaps this was meant to be funny but it just comes off as sad and more to the point we have all seen this done a thousand times before usually to much greater effectbr br the movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all the dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger a maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons they make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves and much of the time they dont even pretend to be scaredbr br in the same vein as drivein massacre the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed with the exception of the final murder when the killers identity is revealed a random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question there is no one seen stalking the characters at any time in drivein massacre this served to make the film funny unintentionally of course but here it is not funny at allbr br and as another reviewer has pointed out the soundtrack includes music that is very bad even for those who like punk rock the extras look uncomfortable dancing to it the score at the end there is no music at the beginning consists of a band of sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the moviebr br dont misunderstand the points made in this review this reviewer likes bad movies such as the nail gun massacre and bachelor party massacre as much as the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th but it seems that the choke tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either and even as straighttodvd movies go this is a poor effortbr br on a positive note the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes but when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivionbr br fans of the traditional 1980s bmovie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie and fans of the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th should do everything in their power to avoid it
