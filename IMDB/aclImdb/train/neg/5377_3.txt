the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called club 905 owned  run by guy johnson andrew parker lead singer dylan sean cook  guitar player mike jason mckee plan to tell the other band members bass player london brooke bailey  drummer nancy tom olson that they are both going solo  their services wont be needed any longer once at the club dylan prepares but mike doesnt show up  the gig turns into a disaster then just as the band think things couldnt get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar that all the doors have been locked so they cant get out  that they cant trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off onebyonebr br produced  directed by juan a mas the choke is a standard bythenumbers teen slasher that really doesnt have anything going for it the script by jessica dolan  susannah lowber not too many horror films out there penned by ladies has some surprisingly good characters in it  some nifty dialogue but while its much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect its so slow  boring that even a few interesting characters cant come anywhere close to saving it as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clich√©s are used from the isolated location the victims cant escape from the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up a few murders  a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like scream 1996  be surprising but doesnt make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically they couldnt have done some of the things they were supposed to  to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on  even though i dont want to boast i was spot on then theres the fact that the makers of the choke felt that its audience would be entertained by showing endless well it feels endless while watching it scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious the kill count is low at first they all decide to stick together good idea but then they all just randomly decide to split up  go their separate ways bad idea when theres a killer on the loose the pace is lethargic the kill scenes are unimaginative  to top it all off the twist ending is poorbr br director mas does alright the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping the gore levels arent really up to scratch theres some blood splatter a guy with a hole in his chest a few dead bodies  someone impaled on some metal poles most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything since the film is about a rock band theres quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible horrible rock songs used on it i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution its not scary theres no real atmosphere  the lack of blood  gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so badbr br with a supposed budget of about 1000000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look shot in a place called spokane in washington apparently the acting is one of the films strongest points as its generally pretty good all round i mean noone is going to win an oscar but it aint half badbr br the choke is a throughly routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever  a criminal lack of blood gore violence nudity  dead bodies i mean if a slasher hasnt got any sex or gore then whats the point those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for right
