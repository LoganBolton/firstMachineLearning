released on dvd in the uk as axe the choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department the story is almost nonexistent resulting in a film which comprises mostly of people wandering around a dark building with the exception of two characters who are quite obviously destined to be the films survivors everyone is thoroughly objectionable meaning that the viewer couldnt care less when they get slaughtered the deaths arent gory enough unless a brief shot of a pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns your stomach and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flickbr br the waferthin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the worlds largest nightclub there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms unlike any club ive ever seen where they are picked off by an unseen assailant for a low budget effort the production values are okay and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors but with not nearly enough genuine scares a reluctance to get really messy this is a slasher so wheres the graphic splatter way too much dreadful dialogue particularly from the notdeadsoonenough drummer and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style the movie quickly becomes extremely boring
