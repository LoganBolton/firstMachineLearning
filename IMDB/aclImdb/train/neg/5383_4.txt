i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts the true test is whether it is good from start to finish which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review most of us would agreeeven those like me who enjoy reading many blogsthat blogs cant compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons likewise fem cant compare with good film making for a number of reasons and i actually believe its a poor example of independent filmography from start to finish fem feels like a pieced together vlog heck even myspace gets some pimping if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15i dontid go watch it fem while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media is so personal that it is without an interesting story its like watching the mundaneness of life which i think most would agree is very naturally boring and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it their very postmodern film about making a film cue my yawnbr br ultimately i come away not caring the least bit about any of it im shocked that im actually interested in taking time out to write this review even its not that fem is downright bad because it isnt it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybejust maybesomething of interest is about to happen its rather that its just downrightmediocre i feel so indifferent about it that its almost fitting of an oxymoron passionate indifferencebr br i hope the creatorsactors in the film get out of debt from their efforts theyll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with lifebr br see this movie if youve got time to waste and nothing much you want to do otherwise pass it by and dont worry that youve missed some great undiscovered talent you really havent
