all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they cant release their film through a mainstream distributor consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesnt justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good otherwise dont waste your time  dont believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you wont have to waste money still the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their selfindulgent miniseries otherwise theyre one hit wonders who never had a hit
