i dont know where to begin the cast is full of people whove never done anything before or since debralee scott is listed on cover boxes but does not appear in the movie at all the writing is quite bad even for college films its obviously very low budget with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editingbr br the characters are pretty typical for college films  timid guy nerd suave black guy tough guys guy with mustache attractive girl small town girl etc the featured teacher is about whats youd expect middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easilybr br if you want to see a college flick stay clear from this one its so bad its not even funny
