while being one of the stars of this film doesnt necessarily give me sage insight i do know quite a bit of what was first thereand what ended up on the screen i remember seeing the original cut of incoming freshman and being very pleased it was funny sexy raunchy all the main requirements of a drivein film you have to remember this was shot and released before all the restanimal house porkys etcso in its own way this flick was truly ahead of its time for whatever reasons the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film and then edited in should i say shuffled the most random scenes ever the fat guy the people with goat headswhat the heck was all that im sure it was put in for additional ta but it was so slowly paced it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt but all in all its a fun memory for meespecially in that im able to say that the worst movie ive ever seenim in
