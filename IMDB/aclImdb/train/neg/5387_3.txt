in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting it never got therebr br the people are going from one point to another point with really no point if there was one it was very dull there was no action suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless so there was no caring what happened to thembr br all together the movie was pretty boringbr br i give it a 310br br i like that it wasnt shaky choppy camerawork and if there was music it didnt annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous
