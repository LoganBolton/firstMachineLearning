theres a good movie lurking here but this isnt it the basic idea is good to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse but the logic is so muddled that its impossible to get involvedbr br for example our four heroes are understandably paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion thats wiped out virtually all of mankind yet they wear surgical masks some times not others some times theyre fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person other times they seem completely unconcernedbr br worse after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new killorbekilled world these people constantly behave like total newbs they dont bother accumulating proper equipment or food theyre forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere they dont take elementary precautions when meeting strangers and after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race theyre as squeamish as sheltered debutantes you have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long and even if they did why anyone would want to make a movie about thembr br so when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions its impossible to take their soulsearching seriously their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sensebr br on top of all this we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of chris pine his portrayal of an arrogant young james t kirk might have seemed shrewd when viewed in isolation but in carriers he plays on exactly that same note arrogant and boneheaded its impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic rangebr br on the positive side the film looks excellent its got an oversharp saturated look that really suits the southwestern us locale but that cant save the truly feeble writing nor the paperthin and annoying characters even if youre a fan of the endoftheworld genre you should save yourself the agony of watching carriers
