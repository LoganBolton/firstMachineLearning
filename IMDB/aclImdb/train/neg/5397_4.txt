i think this is one of the weakest of the kenneth branagh shakespearian works after such great efforts as much ado about nothing etc i thought this was poor the cast was weaker alicia silverstone nivoli mcelhone but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the bards work and cut out some of the play to put in the musicaldance sequencesbr br you just dont do shakespeare and then mess with the play sorry but that is just wrong i love some cole porter just like the next person but jeez dont mess with the shakespeare skip this and watch prosperos books if you want to see a brilliant shakespearean adaptation of the tempest
