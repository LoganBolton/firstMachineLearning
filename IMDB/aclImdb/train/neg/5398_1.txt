this selfindulgent mess may have put the kibosh on mr branaghs career as an adapter of shakespeare for the cinema released 4 years ago not a peep of an adaptation since i just finished watching this on cable  holy god its terriblebr br i agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill that being said ill take the risk if only because loves labours lost is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr branaghs directorial abilities in the past branagh has always been a pretty lousy director grindingly literalminded starstruck unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors he loves his american stars but loves himself more making damn sure that he gets all the good linesbr br along those lines the sad fact remains that loves labours lost is scarcely worse than the interminable ghastly bloated hamlet from 1996 in fact this film may be preferable if only because its about 13 the length branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeares to the milieu of cole porter george gershwin fred astaire yada yada so he sets the thing in 1939 leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of thirties standards wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during im in heaven and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing himself included the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didnt call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies i dont even blame the cast to paraphrase hamlet the screenplays the thing no one could possibly come off well in this hodgepodge the illustrious rsc alumni fare no better than alicia silverstone who could possibly act in this thingbr br branaghs first mistake was in thinking that loves labours lost was a play worth filming trust me it isnt its an anomaly in the bards canon written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers  not the usual audience for which he wrote hence theres a lot of precious and tedious wordplay references to contemporary scholastic nonsense parodies of lylys euphues    in other words hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience hell it doesnt appeal to an audience already predisposed to shakespearean comedy the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately updating it with any gimmick that comes to hand which begs the question why botherbr br branaghs second mistake was in thinking that shakespeares creampie of a play could be served with a sideorder of gershwins marmalade clearly the idea or hope was to make an unintelligible elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time but again this begs the question why botherbr br
