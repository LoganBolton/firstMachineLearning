spoilers all too often hollywoods shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text films including branaghs henry v and 1993s much ado about nothing are powerful pieces of work watching loves labours lost therefore its such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so hideously thrown to waste sadly loves labours lost is awful the king of navarre alessandro nivola and his friends have forsaken drink and women for three years to focus on their studies plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france alicia silverstone and her entourage arrive soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the princes mindbr br from the start you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by ken branagh the plot is still there and the script remains but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste classics like the way you look tonight lets face the music and dance im in heaven are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just dont belong herebr br aside from weak singing we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of rolesbr br the main eight actors four men  four women are all equally dire and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy spallbr br in fact only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and thats the consistently magnificent nathan lane lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester costardbr br theres little else to be said really loves labours lost deserves mild praise for branaghs original take on an old tale unfortunately though thats where the positives end weakly acted performed sang and constructed loves labours lost is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made a poor disappointing choice by branagh and heres hoping his next effort is better
