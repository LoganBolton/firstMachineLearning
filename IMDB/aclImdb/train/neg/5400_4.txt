this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story two tabloid reporters one seasonedmiguel ferrerand one not so accomplishedjulie entwisle begin to believe that a serial killermichael h moss may actually be a vampire stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally but by way of a black cessna he seeks his victims the gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale keep in mind that mr king had nothing to do with this film i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night
