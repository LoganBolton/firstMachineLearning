my first opinions on this movie were of course badi was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects moviewhat i got was actually not that badthe special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decentthe acting wasnt that bad and overall i had fun watching this movieits still a pretty bad film but its not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and im pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasnt that goodoverall its a film that should be avoided but to me it wasnt as bad as i was expecting it to be
