this review is mostly all spoilers if you plan on enjoying this film dont read this reviewbr br  thats the problem with kids tv nowadays its all so patronizing and condescending wow that was fun wasnt it no it wasnt and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well and that is what flight of the reindeer is all about admittedly i havent seen flight of the reindeer in a few years so i might be hazy on some points but i remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the timebr br  essentially the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for christmas now the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal i think it was bullfrogs anyway through this book mr lecturer  family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the north pole now if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept but mr lecturer isnt me so i guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where hes gone of course things go awry and before he knows it a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and hes stranded at the north polebr br  are you still following this goodbr br  his family of course are devastated i would be too i mean what a sucktacular christmas elsewhere mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white rather than try to escape immediately as i would have done he greets everyone there with open arms this hidden civilization of midget monsters and he greets them with open arms ooookayyyy they feed him this story that they are the elves of santa claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist and mr lecturer accepts all this he even accepts that santa claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever theres just one problem  they dont want him to leave the world cant know of their secret existence after all before theyd know it thered be a mcdonalds and a starbucks on every street cornerbr br  still with mebr br now mr nice guys family find the book and assume hes gone to the north pole boy wouldnt they be embarrassed if they found out hed just gone for a brisk walk before the audience knows it theyre jetting off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet meanwhile mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave i cant remember exactly but i do recall him holding santa claus to gunpoint a fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via santas sleigh with santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes mr whatever through some marvellous coincidence finds himself flying alongside his familys plane that is looking for him so he jumps on to their plane the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever afterbr br  the fact is there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it and its that charm that is utterly devoid from flight of the reindeer there isnt much wrong with it nothing which insults the intelligence well obviously there is but its a kids film and thus can get away with such things or anything particularly offensive but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either it just doesnt feel christmassy and for a film that is all about christmas that it a pretty major flaw but hey i dont think flight of the reindeers target audience mind about that why should they theyre all so doped up on sedatives they probably couldnt spell christmasbr br  i give it three out of ten if it was a tvmovie then id add another two stars onto it we all know how bad they can get
