all for love  as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend  is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleons army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison  theres also a storyline involving a murder br br i will be honest and confess that i wasnt too taken by the movie since im not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and its got a good cast that features miranda richardson  anna friel  richard e grant  michael gough and jason isaacs  the costume design as you can expect is also excellent br br ill be very surprised if this movie doesnt get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime  captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and theres a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen  you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what theyre doing
