this is one of those topics i can relate to a little more than most people as i hate noise  have no idea how those in big cities new york especially how people get any sleep at all it astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days the basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic its too bad thats about it tim robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes especially with the absolute supermodel looking margarita leiveva he didnt seem to really be altogether there my biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning  talented actress to boot margarita levieva she doesnt have a lot to do but she is supermodel beautiful even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door it makes me sad that there can be people such as paris hilton  kim kardashian in the world wno redeemable skills or talent to have more fame and success than this talented beauty i didnt care for much of this film because the script isnt very good but am glad i got to see some new talent i hope that producers  directors think about margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film if they can make megan fox a star cmon she isnt that hot  her acting talent is worse than madefor disney channel tv shows from 1 film it should happen easily for her as she is gorgeous  has talent id recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable heres hoping this makes her career  if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years
