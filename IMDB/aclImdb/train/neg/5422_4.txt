what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who cant deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer particularly car alarms its an odd idea for a film which has about as much creative credibility as death wish it is clever at points particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel im too stupid to be understanding this he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion we read it and dont get it eitherjust then a car alarm goes off throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises though all in all it does little to help us understand our hero who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeperinto his persona br br the filmmaking itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems shoddy editing and visible boom mikes no noise isnt allbad william hurt is at least colorful at least the ending doesnt fall flat overall it drives home a logistical point one you havent probably thought of at least i hadnt though all in all ninety minutes long it couldnt have ended sooner the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it startedbr br this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival but probably wont get picked up for distribution check it out on dvd if youre really partial to someone involved in the project otherwise skip it
