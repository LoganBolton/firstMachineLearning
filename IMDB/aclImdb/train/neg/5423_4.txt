ive been using imdb for a few years now but have never written any reviews before however this movie so disappointed me even with a modest score of 64 at the time of writing that i couldnt keep quiet anymorebr br noise is the story of a new yorker tim robbinswho is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alterego as a as a vigilante the rectifier and vandalizes any cars he finds with a caralarm soundingbr br i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms car alarms car alarms car alarms there is really no other focus when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of robbins character br br yes were all annoyed by noise nobody likes the sound of car alarms of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle and this movie uses that fact and pretty much that fact alone to sell this movie i say pretty much because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship including a completely needless threesome which is obviously thrown in for those moviegoers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie honestly its eyerollingbr br robbins character very shortly into the movie becomes completely unrelatable it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry carbashing dude into this hero of the little guy the rectifier however the transformation doesnt take place he just renames himselfbr br i could go on for a while annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie and the selfsatisfied smirk which never quite leaves robbins face doesnt help either br br overall i think its very obvious what this movie is trying to be as its pretty much shoved down your throat but in my opinion it fails in a big way just one guys opinion cheers
