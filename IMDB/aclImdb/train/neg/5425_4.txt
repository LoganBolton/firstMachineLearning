i got mirror mirror mainly because yvonne de carlo was in it i thought she was great in american gothic but sadly she didnt have a very big role in this film it starts off ok and the pace moves along nicelybut by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull thats not to say that this is a boring film but its just very average and nothing spectacular i didnt like the posession side of it and there were no decent gore scenes plus the main story was very confusing and the ending doesnt make much sense at all i did however like the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentorsbr br i wouldnt particularly recommend mirror mirror to horror fans  its nothing to wet yourself over
