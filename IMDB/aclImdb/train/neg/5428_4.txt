another priyadarshanvohra flick another movie that was seen for tp rather than actual desire the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie akshay paresh and many others but needless to say i had low expectations from this moviebr br i was happy with the casting in general except rajpal yadav who once again annoys to no limit he does however extract some laughs but these were those standard slapstick nonoriginal jokes in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner for an extended period who are considered greatbr br which brings us to the other instrument the dumroo hardly requires any talent it has no variations and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances hmm sounds like rajpal yadav good analogy but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the dhol doesbr br this movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played sometimes the dhol was played sometimes the dumroo sometimes both together but mostly the dumroo played alone and the monkey danced and like any 24 year old sooner than later i got boredbr br the movie has some good dhol good moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying dumroo entertaining initially then tolerable then irritating the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on mere bhains ko anda kyun mara if you havent watched it watch it on filmy it comes in the evenings and is really quite funnybr br this movie had its moments the actors did a fine job except rajpal yadav who can act though ive seen him in main meri patni who annoys more than entertains ive said it many time and ill say it again i really think sharman joshi and tushar kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multistar comedies especiallybr br some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each otherbr br but after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added this mean that once the girl was in the following 4560 mins was increasingly torturous the climax was so bad its almost good category i mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatablebr br the movie is also extremely predictable theres hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gagbr br the movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump down or up and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girlbr br most of the really bad scenes were towards the end one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition the last 1015 was especially distatefull and completely spoils this moviebr br i didnt find tanushree datta quite the siren she was to play and her acting talent is in serious question especially in view of her nonappealing looks if you cant be a hot and cant act how much time can you survivebr br technically also this movie was weak with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and cameraworkbr br the songs except the title track were no good either when the songs played in the 2nd half i could feel the collective gasp from the audiencebr br in all a movie thats just ordinary merely because of the cast and the very low expectationsbr br avoiding it wont be a bad ideabr br and if it has to be watched watching it on tv for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointedbr br s lots of stale jokes rajpal yadav last 45 mins and last 15 mins especially bad technically bad songsbr br s tries to be more than what it was not the regular cast im happier for it tanushree dattabr br s some good scenes towards the beginningtitle song good acting and cast except rybr br total 4510 im trying to be objective here i dont like rajpal yadav or tanushree datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations so im giving it the benefit of all doubts on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4
