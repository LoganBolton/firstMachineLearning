the movie starts with a nice song looks like a thriller with arbaaz khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy with the routine stupid idiots like golmaal with tusshar sharman kunal and rajpal acting like grown up kids their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring there is a bored sub plot of tanushrees brother being killed towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of hera pheri and wait there is also a long chase in payals housebr br the film is so boring that it makes you fall asleepbr br direction by priyan is very bad musicpritam is routine except the first songbr br cinematography is bad the film has a cheap look throughoutbr br rajpal yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isnt loud and over the top like other films but no he becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times tusshar should not speak in a film his dial delivery is terrible sharman is the saving grace he is the sole actor who acts very well in this film kunal khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult but doesnt impress much tanushree is bad as always arbaaz khan gets less scope and is usual payal is a non actress murli sharma is terrible
