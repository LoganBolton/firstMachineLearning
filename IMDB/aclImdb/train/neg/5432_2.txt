a battleship is sinking its survivors hanging onto a nearby liferaft sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacksbr br even though noel cowards name is the only one that you notice during the credits everything thats cinematic in it is because of lean and on technical terms its very good david lean just knew films from the getgo there are many moments where cowards studied dialogue takes a second seat and leans visual sense takes centre stage try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end and that whole scene the tracking shot towards the hymn singing the scene where were inside a house that gets bombedbr br noel coward is one of the worst actors ive ever seen hes totally wooden not displaying emotion character or humanity you can see it in his eyes that hes not really listening to what the other performer is saying hes just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own linebr br 710br br its episodic a bit repetitive and the flashbacks overwhelm the story theres no central story that they advance just give general insights into the characters still its an interesting film worth a watch  and a good debut for lean its not a very deep or penetrating film and its definitely a propaganda film but its also a showcase for leans editing skills  its all about how the pieces are put together
