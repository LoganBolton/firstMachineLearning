noel cowarda witty and urbane manwas friends with louis mountbattenmr cowarda longtime admirer of all things navalwas commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of mountbattens shipin a peculiarly british way it was considered that a film about the royal navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propagandait was also considered a good idea to have mr coward play the part of the ships captainamang the many qualities needed to command a fighting shipthe ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated point songs does not come very high up the list at admiralty houseor at least one would hope nota captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike mr coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at drury lane and binkie beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tamemould and direct a ships crew in wartime must be brought into questionhe folds himself languorously around the bridgepatronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officershe only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home much is made of the warship as a microcosm of british societythemeand the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneyscanny northerners etcwithout whom no war can be foughtthey spend most of their time on board smokingmoaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up never mindtheres plenty more where they came fromonce ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smokingmoaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up by contrast mr coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown uphehis lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnamesthat nice young master johnny mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships mr coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its masterhe marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheekpresumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion so yeswe do have a microcosm of british society herebut perhaps not in the way the makers of in which we serve intended at the end mr coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past himgoodbye edwardsit was a privilege to sail with youhe enunciates as if he was reciting how now brown cow it may have been david leans feature debutbut the hand of noel coward looms large right across this picturehe was a funny and clever manbetter suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry songhe had a talent to amuseno doubtbut he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue being noel coward was a fulltime jobhe had no time to be a real person
