i am quite a fan of novelistscreenwriter michael chabon his novel wonder boys became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson his masterful novel the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay won the pulitzer prize a few years back and he had a hand in the script of spider man 2 arguably the greatest comic book movie of all timebr br director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces such as the gutbusting dodgeball and the genius short film series terry tate office linebacker and with a cast including peter saarsgard sienna miller nick nolte and mena suvari this seems like a nobrainerbr br it is literallybr br jon foster stars as art bechstein the son of a mobster nolte who recently graduated with a degree in economics jon is in a state of arrested development he works a minimum wage job at book barn has a vapid relationship with his girlfriendboss phlox suvari which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passionbr br one night at a party an exroommate introduces jon to jane miller a beautiful smart violinist later that night they go out for pie and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul if you do it will make this night indelible jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by yet none of them look him in the eye i imagine it must be what death feels like he saysbr br the next day janes wild boyfriend cleveland saarsgard kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill and soon jon cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol this doesnt sit well with phlox who pushes jon for a more personal relationship namely letting her meet his new friends and his father the film then attempts to take us on jons journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father phlox and his deadend job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and janebr br there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film hes completely uninteresting he has no ambitions passions or goals he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met at the outset this isnt a problem but he never gets any more interesting hes a completely passive character he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himselfbr br consequently the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party have sex and get in arguments in other words much ado about nothing what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside sweeping cinematography ponderous voiceover with characters staring off into the distance lots of sex scenes both straight and gay big arguments more angry sex a chase scene and a tragic death but it doesnt seem to matter ironically at one point jane confused at a number of jons aimless actions asks him whats going on jon what is this all about yes jon do tell we in the audience are dying to know toobr br the title the mysteries of pittsburgh must refer to the characters themselves because thats what they are they are all facades onedimensional standins for actual people the film never lets us in we never know what makes any of them tick we see them do lots of things but we dont know why and the absence of why is one of the worst things a movie can have
