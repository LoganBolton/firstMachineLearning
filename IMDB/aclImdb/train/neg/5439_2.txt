cecil b demilles 1922 parlortoprison tearjerker manslaughter finds the lovely leatrice joy as a goodatheart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with her recklessness leads to imprisonment which in turn leads to her regeneration thomas meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in lydia joy but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released it is up to her to rescue himbr br if the plot doesnt sound too bad youll be floored by the woeful presentation the quality of demilles direction is very low and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him the photography is standard and flat and the editing is hardly more dynamic one could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes evening gowns golfing costumes motoring costumes piles of furs that its subtitle could be fashions of 1922br br one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting which is mostly flat and wooden when it is not it is merely routine silent gesturing rolling eye balls twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements what would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films is here merely dull to watch the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally she is convincing and endearing in tearful closeups as long as you dont read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak like i said everybody else is droningly routine joy meighan even julia faye her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardombr br the worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it meighans character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of america is declining in its moral stance and going right back to the decadence of rome insert absurd flashback this movies moralizing has been described as victorian but its further than that it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didnt take it any more seriously than modern viewers couldbr br this movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a typical silent movie with its archaic moral structure wooden acting and bad direction demille shows that he could be a terrible director with no sense of pacing camera placement or skill in handling either script or actors i cant imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously boring slow and idiotic i recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only
