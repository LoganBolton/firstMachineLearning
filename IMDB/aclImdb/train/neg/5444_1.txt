it was 1974 and it starred martin sheenbr br that alone says what to expect of this moviebr br and it was a movie according to the movie slovik had reformed got a good woman and didnt want to fightbr br in real life slovik may have been a naive innocent or he may have just wanted to manipulate the systembr br whoever slovik was or wasnt is for history to decide but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting and the movie took sidesbr br with no regard to servicemen who were in viet nam either in 1974 as willie nelson would say lets tell the truth it was about the viet nam war not wwii eoes was as propagandistic as gung ho was in the fortiesbr br according to this movie slovik stated his position plain and simple he had a nervous problem heck i have a clinical nervous condition and trust me if i had done military duty it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on kp duty or latrine duty with no problembr br if we believe the teleflick slovik didnt have that option no doubt because of his criminal historybr br whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer ive learned that movies from this decade or that decade in dealing with service or military duty will pretty much take the same stance over and overbr br 1940s and 1950s serve your countrybr br 1960s and 1970s mock your countrybr br this is the historybr br the whole movie seemed predictably hollywood to me he refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotionbr br such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowfulbr br im not a catholic but i thought the recital of the hail mary by ned beatty and sheen at the end with the lords prayer was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it fasterbr br i dont see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at tricky dick nixon and the viet nam warbr br i hope it was all worth it for slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example
