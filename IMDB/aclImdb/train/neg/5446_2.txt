for loyal duran duran fans who want to watch a good music video skip this one the producers decided to get creative and make this 80s video something of a scifi story involving the evil barbarella villain from which the band got its name br br what makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80s duran duran songs confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted but we have to suffer through some cheap spinoff story hosted by an evil dr mario its almost too much to bear 210
