the idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked late night shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that when we do get to a point it is so monumentally moronic that i kept thinking i must have misunderstood it but i didntbr br sean tells the story of an osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so didnt realise they were sharing his friend asks but what about the weekends sean doesnt have an adequate explanation sean then tells the story of his own similar problem which is that he isnt sure his girlfriend is still living at home as he works during the night and she works during the day so they never see each other this has been going on for three weeks but his friend doesnt ask yes but as i said before what about the weekends you must see her then it doesnt make sense what are you going on about sean are you on medication or something but lets be generous and assume that they both work seven days a weekbr br we see sean checking to see if the soap and towels have been used in fact bizarrely he starts to carry the soap around with him but what about his girlfriends conditioner and shampoo sanpro and moisturiser toothpaste and toothbrush lets go to the kitchen what about food and drink is any missing has any been bought in the bedroom has the shared bed been made or not are her clothes being used and exchanged for clean ones is the laundry basket fuller in the toilet is the seat up or down i mean good griefbr br and to cap it all paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home why doesnt he just phone herbr br but it gets worse in the last act although noone told vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them lennys love interest and seans girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group there isnt even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidencesbr br to be fair the dialogue is ok but not nearly good enough to make up for the weak characters or annoyingly lame storybr br i heard one of actors interviewed and he promised no guns no drugs no corsets i thought great but after halfanhour of tedium i was yelling at the screen i want guns i want drugs i want corsetsbr br it wouldnt have taken much to sort these problems out but on the official website the director boasts that the film wasnt scriptedited thats all you need to know
