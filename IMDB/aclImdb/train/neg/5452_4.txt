as far as films go this is likable enough entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story i would have really quite liked it had i not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set inbr br glasgow in scotland yet every character is english save for seans girlfriend who is dutch scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs  roles as a scottish woman  as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life i really dont think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented scottish actorsor at least got english ones who could toss together a decent accent the futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult
