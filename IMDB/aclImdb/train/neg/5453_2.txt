ok i caught this film halfway through butohdeargoditsoundsliketheyreallreadingfromscriptsbr br especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting scripting and general plausibility it quite clearly appears to be a cashin on human traffic but whilst that is not the best film ever it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnestyethopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash
