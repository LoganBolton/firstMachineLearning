wow this film was just bloody horrid so bad in fact that even though i didnt pay to see it i still wanted my money backbr br the film is about nothing intelligible its a mishmash of scifi cliches that were done better by much more skilled film makers the performances especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing ed wood sort of way speaking of ed wood hed be proud of the characters dialogue its just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor on top of that it doesnt make sense nor does the plot or lackthereofbr br the visual effects are okay but not enough to go oh wow thats cool and they just seem to be thrown in to be cool rather than be a good plot devicebr br the soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood again it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to be coolbr br which brings me to my final point perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot story and dialogue instead of trying to be cool he wouldnt have made such a dorky cliche of a short filmbr br
