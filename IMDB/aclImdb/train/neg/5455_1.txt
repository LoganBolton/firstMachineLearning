saw this piece of work at a film fest in ca my god what was the director thinking film professors should use this film as a case study on what not to do when making a short film first off this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the film takes place partially in the waystation some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere where nothing really takes placebr br the acting is beyond bad so bad in fact that i almost thought it was a comedy the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films there is one or two decent performances including the guys who played jacob and fenner but its like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue which bordered on absurd the writer whom i assume is also the director writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villainbr br the overall production value is pretty good but to be honest with a film this bad its easy to overlook it the production design is pretty good although the waystation looks like any ordinary bar the costumes and makeup are okay and i understand the production was working with a low budget its just when the characters speak or they try and push the plot forward the film unravels into a muck of crapbr br as ive said this film is god awful its like the directorwriter watched a lot of scifi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this my only hope is that he used other peoples money on this because if he used his own hes a total sucker
