this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why shes not such a bad person after all give us a break heres my question to the filmmakers if letourneau were a man and vili were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer hell nobr br imagine switching the genders in this film and then youll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead wed likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sexbr br lets call a spade a spade letourneau is a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts shes a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy
