this movie is a pathetic attempt apparently to justify the actions of mary ann letourneau in order to do this they cast a 19yearold well probably not in order to do this there was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out if they had even been allowed to do them  as they should mary anns boyfriend was my nephews age making her a pedophile sixth grade people the definition of pedophile doesnt have to include many children  all you need is onebr br i really dont care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage she had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to the reason given is that she is bipolar rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication its understandable then that she was not thinking rationally one hopes that she now understands her actionsbr br now that she and vili are married and have two children together i pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearlybr br all that aside penelope ann miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role
