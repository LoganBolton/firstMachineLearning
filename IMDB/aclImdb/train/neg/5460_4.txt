curiously season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the maninthemac and also fade into murderbr br furthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard herebr br this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversationbr br columbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughsbr br the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crimebr br ironically what turns out to be arguably columbos worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next 5 minutes are hilarious  its just that columbos hair is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstylebr br sadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes br br for columbo completionists only
