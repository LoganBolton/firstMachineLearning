typical tromatrash this smutty 80s flick is considered one of the highlights of lloyd kaufmans notorious production studio alongside the toxic avenger released one year earlier the toxic avenger is far superior if you ask me but this demented splatterflick is nevertheless endurable as well just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door the events take place in tromaville a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and they certainly arent lying the safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard to say the least even homer simpson never was this nonchalant and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school the first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house oh the humanity shortly after however the nuclear leaks also affect the schools weed plantation and thing really start to get messy after smoking a joint at a party the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum class of nuke em high is bottomofthebarrel horror filmmaking with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and makeup effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless if you enjoy watching faces melting away getting crushed or splitting in half this is definitely a mustsee unlike the aforementioned the toxic avenger this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens like for example when chrissy and warren try to figure out whats wrong with their hormones the crude humor isnt as effective as in toxic avenger and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish proceed only if youre an avid tromafanatic
