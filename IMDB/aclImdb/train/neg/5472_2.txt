all day now ive been watching dinosaurs and all day theyve had the same fundamental problembr br they dont believe in firearms they just dont seem to have been told about them or something bullets bounce off of dinosaurs maybe its because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder and the laws of physics were just different back then aah no come on if theyre close enough to chemically operate today theyd have to be vulnerable to fast even subsonic lead projectiles its that simplebr br look the toughestskinned reptiles on the planet today alligators and crocodiles are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire theyre nothing magic you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs they dont take armorpiercing bullets or anything special small bullets penetrate them they just dont kill them somewhat but not really large bullets are preferred because the challenge as with most game is to kill the animal with one shot so it doesnt run hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvestedbr br most animals including predators are easily repelled by gunfire between the noise and the pain of even a nonlethal wound most will run away an exception are big bears which are so fearless that theyre merely enraged by mortal wounds cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded weve seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions a big cat will run if it can but if it cant it will charge as a final act of desperation where a trex would fit in this spectrum is unknown their behavior simply has not been observed with these larger animals safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile andor applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge with a trex of course this could be a serious problem ive seen a trex skull they have one in the museum downtown and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach small bullets would still penetrate them they wouldnt just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill br br so here we have cortez and his men this is before the famous mexican campaign apparently captured by american natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid it appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of trexes that terrorized the continent in the day rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt  kill them ok maybe they dont have m16s like the guys in the carnosaur series but they do have flintlocks crossbows pointed sticks big ones made from trees and swords maybe thats a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto but theyve several guys and id quickly bet on them over a dinosaur oh wait theres a cannon about a 4incher thats just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus skull so they lay a trap with a squad of men cannon pointed sticks in a ravine and lure the first trex into it using a pretty brown girl as bait cortez points out that theyll not have time to reload so theyll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim trex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire and we see both a crossbow bolt and the cannon ball bounce off forget it end of credibility a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez torso armor and a 4 cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship this would also certainly get through the hide ribcage or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet do you think a whale could withstand a 4 cannon ball and heres trex still standing not even bleeding so cortez lures it to the ravine where it falls onto the pointed sticks which i guess by magic penetrate it and kill it yaaay pointed sticks br br the dinos arent completely invulnerable to gunfire  they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol this runs it off so its not as mean as a bear or a buffalo at least in the moviesbr br they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb  made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones my money would still be on the cannon its engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowders energy in one direction  toward the target a bomb is a much more diffused application of force a real bomb not a gourd bomb has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure think pipe bomb vs firecracker a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof trust me on that one
