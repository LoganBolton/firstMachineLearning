tyrannosaurus azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous spanish explorer hernando cortes ian ziering has landed in mexico with six of his best men including lieutenant rios marco sanchez they intend to claim the land in the name of the spanish  maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises within minutes they have their first sight of local aztec savages within minutes after that cortes  his men are captured  held prisoner if that wasnt bad enough it turns out that a couple of tyrannosaurus rex live there  like to eat the locals in an effort to win their lives the spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas  ulterior motives its not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out forbr br directed by brian trenchardsmith who coincidently made one of my all time favourite exploitations films turkey shoot 1982 which i throughly recommend to one  all  also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of aztec rex the title was changed by the scifi channel when they aired it maybe as the original title tyrannosaurus azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film this is yet another idiotic  cheap looking scifi channel creature feature  thats all you need to know really based on  around the real spanish conquistador cortes during his expedition to mexico the film definitely doesnt strive for historic accuracy although i will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately tyrannosaurus azteca is still just a creature feature with a bunch of people running from some poor cgi computer graphic of a monster despite its period setting not too sure what else i can say despite being set centuries ago the usual clich√©s are here the characters are the usual cardboard cutouts make stupid decisions  the selfish one the heroic one the backstabbing one the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten  the pretty woman are all here  easy to spot the film is predictable silly dull  doesnt really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace  theres one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you the story isnt that good  has plenty of holes too this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few daysbr br now i have seen  commented on plenty of scifi channel creature features  usually the cgi computer effects are terrible  while tyrannosaurus azteca doesnt exactly buck the trend i will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards theres a few decent gore effects here too theres a cut out heart a guys leg is bitten off theres some blood splatter a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur theres a few dead bodies seen  someone is stabbed with a spear the trex gets to eat a couple of people too the production values are really cheap the aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from styrofoam  those spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist they could have simply stepped out of it  run away it was so lowbr br with a supposed budget of about 900000 i cant see where the money went shot in oahu in hawaii in apparently fifteen days the acting isnt great from noone i have ever heard ofbr br tyrannosaurus azteca really isnt any better than any other cheap scifi channel creature feature despite an almost interesting  unusual premise that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not at a guess probably not
