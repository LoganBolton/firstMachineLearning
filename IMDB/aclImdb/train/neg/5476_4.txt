i dont know if this is one of the syfy channel original movies but thats exactly what it feels like a cheap low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly it contains laughable effects lame dialog and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it funny how many of the kids from 90210 are doing cheap tv movies nowbr br ian ziering plays cortes who we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of native people while conquering parts of north america here he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic but as a slimy opportunist his character would probably be killed off if this werent loosely based on a historical figure in this story cortes is on a brief surveying mission trying to find something of value to prove he deserves financing to further explore america he and his men find a small tribe of aztecs plagued by dinosaursbr br the actual hero of the story turns out to be lt rios who proves to be honorable resourceful and wise he knows the right thing to do in every situation which puts him at opposition with cortes as well as with the young ambitious aztec shaman of course the native girl who is supposed to marry the headstrong scheming shaman falls for rios furthering his anger towards the spanish outsiders so its all pretty clich√© the dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease despite taking place in an area that seems wide open the story pretty much takes place in either the woods or the aztec village for 95 of the time so it isnt visually exciting eitherbr br i didnt even recognize ian ziering they gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent and somehow he disappeared into it he doesnt look or sound spanish for a second however making the casting choice wrong in every way if this movie had been released theatrically he would have been singled out for a razzie no questionbr br overall forgettable
