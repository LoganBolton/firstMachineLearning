it was 1 am in the morning and i had nothing else to do dont judge me pleasebr br were back in time during the spanish settlements a group have made their way onto an island it doesnt take too long before they encounter a large reptile which gobbles up their horse soon theyre captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the reptile gods the cg sucks it reminds me of the cg of early console video games the encounters were lame the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit otherwise its just a middling effort
