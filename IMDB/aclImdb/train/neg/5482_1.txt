epsilon aka alien visitor is not what i expected this is a nobudget australian film with no special effects other than speededup film and quick scene cuts the female alien who comes over immediately able to speak perfectly accented australian can blip from place to place or time to time and alter her perception of the flow of time to match the faster humansbr br an elderly grandmother tells her two granddaughters about a story a wandering man told her 40 years before when an unnamed she came to the planet naked and completely disoriented unable to recognize which star in the sky she came fromshe meets a man alone camping in the australian outback apparently bewildering him she is here by mistake and gets angry when she is told she is on earth the earthlings are known as consummate despoilers of the environment and a metaphor for the most insulting thing imaginable to the rest of the universe those who breathe the foul air but do nothing about it sticking their heads under the sand like an ostrich in another amusing metaphor earthlings are frogsbr br from there it is entirely a film about dialogue as the perplexed man tries to understand shes peculiar psychology and viewpoints even as she calls him unintelligent and quaint the man begins to realize maybe its humans who are irrational and not thinking straight yet while waiting to be beamed up back home she sees that this human is not entirely faulty in his thinking and even falls in love with himbr br the dialogue about perspectives is in spots interesting but it is all layered with a heavyhanded environmental message and a lowbudget feel there are only two main actors who blip around various deserted scenes and the evil despoiling humans on the planet are never seen at all the environmental message offers no solutions but paints one or two dire metaphors about what will happen to nature and man if something isnt done the logic also doesnt hang together the rest of the universe has given up on earth yet one space woman caught on earth by mistake manages to effect some positive change by the conclusion of the movie what would a battalion of aliens deliberately sent here manage to achieve against pollution and waste
