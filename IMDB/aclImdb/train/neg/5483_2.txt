i just blew four dollars renting this movie why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film im tired of our media justifying a film simply because its canadian and low budget its like they expect canadian films to be lousy so they give it a good review regardlessbr br now about the movie the acting was below average with the exception of the lead male character who was actually pretty good the film quality was poor which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget the script was absolutely horrendous an example is the story which revolves around one of the lead characters a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang whose only purpose is to randomly destroy suvs supposedly many of her gang members bicycles are destroyed in these activities i dont know how she cant afford to just buy new ones since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from vancouver to torontobr br anyway the point of the story which isnt revealed until well over halfway through the movie is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable  as no one will want to live in the areabr br  need i say morebr br shame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film telefilm for supporting it and the globe and mail and georgia straight newspapers for giving such biased reviewsbr br a film shouldnt get special treatment just because its canadian
