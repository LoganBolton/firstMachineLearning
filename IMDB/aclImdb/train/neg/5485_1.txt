without reiterating what was said above about this movie i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this filmthe castlocation and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etcit had a vague shadow of dont look now about the storyline from the beginning a stay in different surroundings italy again to dim the heartbreak of lossor perhaps thats how i saw it so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european countryand i sat there and sat thereand guess what nothing actually happens and i mean nothing you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuousyou are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on its headthe eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys had great scope to take the movie in another direction the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect when the credits started to roll unexpectedly you cant help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish
