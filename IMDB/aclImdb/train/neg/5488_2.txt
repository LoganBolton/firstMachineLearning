why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cashbr br the film isnt clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy its a muddled muddy messbr br there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language  but in the end the girls just want to go back to yanklandbr br there are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads  but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply isnt clearbr br there was also a yank woman in the film it wasnt clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliabr br a pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesnt have the charm of an utterly ghastly film
