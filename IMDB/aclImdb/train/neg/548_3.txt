i saw the 75 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented she said she had seen it before its funny and sad i cried the first time i saw it she gushed maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 75 out of 10 but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a 3 any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me the characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived it is over dramatic and the songs arent all that great my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary we get it laxman isnt the sharpest tool in the shed if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isnt meaningful just a bit embarrassingbr br spoilerbr br generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told too many plot holes to count at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who dont watch them that avidly but it just got tedious it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the endbr br spoiler over perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen but not much at all i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny i didnt shed a single tear nor did i feel like it rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending i dont recommend this movie if you want to watch something good i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad
