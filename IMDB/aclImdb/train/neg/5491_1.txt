we should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there only five others joined before the movie beganbr br there is nothing at all to redeem this movie the acting is awful especially ms hurley the script is banal the effects weve seen a million times the film direction the worst that weve seen meandering and disjointed noone laughed including the kidsbr br we left after 25 minutes it would have been sooner if my wife hadnt gone for a hotdogbr br do not waste your money on this film if theres nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks popcorn and hotdogs and do some people watching youll have a much more enjoyable timebr br
