i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such thirdrate dross as waqt for starters the storyline is totally implausible  spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some selfsufficiency so what does he do he promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges i honestly am not joking here in the meantime his dad is dying of lung cancer but keeps it a secret from the son but he survives long enough to see his son become famous to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own handsbr br the acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess  no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film as usual for indian films the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real worldbr br to be honest the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film the actors such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood
