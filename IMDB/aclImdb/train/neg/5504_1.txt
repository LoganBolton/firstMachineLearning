there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever madebr br why must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another  cases in point mister magoo the avengers  awful br br christopher lloyd whom i normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role his manic portrayal of our beloved uncle martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal his ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon characterbr br the director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and onetake slapstick had some similarity to comedy apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pantsbr br fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script i think the writer used its a mad mad mad mad world as an example of a fine comedy script as manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap  in fact  suddenly it looks pretty good in comparisonbr br what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children i just am not sure whose children it was made for certainly no selfrespecting cardcarrying child i knowbr br if they had to remake my favorite martian why didnt they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic br br unfortunately imdbcom cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travestybr br one good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid  i think
