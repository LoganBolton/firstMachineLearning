after the superb aankhen2002 which was a remake of a gujarati play he comes with waqt which too looks like a stage playbr br in stage plays we have characters shouting overacting here too the samebr br the first half shows amitabh almost kidding the 40 akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerdbr br the film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fakebr br even his reason for hiding his sickness his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by akki is a put offbr br some emotions do touch you but most are too over the topbr br rajpals comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half br br direction by vipul shah is too overdone though some scenes are good music is okaybr br amongst actors amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes akshay kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes his chemistry with bachchan is matchless rajpal is a highlight he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do this is her last film with akki so far shefali is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan
