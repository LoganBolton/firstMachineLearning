rodney dangerfield isnt the main character of this movie hes barely in it most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes one running gag is that a character is named jerk off there are also lots of erection jokes where the punch line is someone has an erection this movie is as funny as kirstie allys british accent is convincingbr br this movie started off like a weak action movie five minutes of back story and then bam unfunny jokes but aside from the terrible writing the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible also this movie does the old bad comedy clich√© of having lots of wellknown bmovie actors harland williams gilbert godfried randy quaid and phil la mar these are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than rodney even though hes billed as the main character dont be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks even that is too much
