i must agree with the very first comment this movie sucks very very hard despite having a very big blist cast the cover of this film for those who arent watching it on comedy central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get tries to put the blame on dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every hasbeen comedian from the 80s randy quaid check ed begley jr check the voice of lisa simpson she can now say that maximum overdrive wasnt her only horrible flick double check and so many many othersbr br the saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with alreadytold jokes nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny youre better off watching paint dry this is definitely directtovideo scrapingthebottomofthebarrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage throw an oldtime star on the cover and youll get some money back off of the rental considering the days of video rental are changing consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbagebr br the only use this movie has if youre having trouble falling asleep itll get you there
