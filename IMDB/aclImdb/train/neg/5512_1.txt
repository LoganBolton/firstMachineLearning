put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1to10star scalebr br bill cosby and ray romano have been at the top  in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually  with their television series yet each has had no success in bigscreen offerings this has also been true for other tv personalities  perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10minute skit or at most the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a halfhour programbr br this film however doesnt have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv snl or anywhere else on a screen or stagebr br its origination date is listed as 2002 but release date  to dvd only  is shown as 2004 it also was filmed not long before rodney dangerfields death so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirsbr br id never heard of it but found it when turningon my set and frankly became fascinated by it some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse  so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10 plan 9 from outer space is the best example  and the bruce jennervillage people opus cant stop the music is anotherbr br unfortunately this flick falls short even there even if rodneys earlier work as well as some of his fellow castmembers fell short of citizen kane or casablanca there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interestbr br unfortunately this presentation doesnt seem to possess even a minute or twos worth of such material
