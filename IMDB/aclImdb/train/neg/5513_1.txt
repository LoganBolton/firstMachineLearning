ive noticed over the years that when a rock star makes his final album before his death that album if its not his best is usually prolific in some way and worthy of a listen at least the album is usually good enough to cement a legacy however when it comes to comedians especially mainstream comics who star in their own vehicles their final movie is usually god awful john belushi had neighbors john candy had wagons east chris farley had almost heroes phil hartman had small soldiers and rodney dangerfield had this moviebr br back by midnight although it may not have been dangerfields very last film is weak in every sense of the word it wrapped filming in 2002 according to this website and its safe to say that it would have stayed on the shelves if dangerfield was still alive i have been a big fan of dangerfields since i was in my early teens and it pains me to see how rotten this film wasbr br what amazes me the most is that a number of other talented people took part in a movie with a very weak premise to begin with dangerfield a great comedian who usually played his comic persona on film is a prison warden who houses a close knit group of inmates when the owner of the prison coloneltomparkermeetssamwalton billionaire eli rockwood randy quaid cuts funding for the prison the warden sends a group of inmates to break out of prison rob rockwoods eponymous convenience stores of consumer goods and break back into prison with the loot by taking whats in the convenience stores they are i guess taking what they believe rockwood owes thembr br with this flimsy premise the movie sputters and stalls frequently on top of that the jokes that you think would be this movies salvation are not even close to funny not even from mr no respect himself that is incredibly disappointing too because youd expect a movie with oscarnominated  randy quaid kirstie alley gilbert gottfried ed begley jr yeardley smith and others to be at least a little bit funny instead quaid plays a character weve seen before in countless other comedies alley plays a british heiress with an awful british accent could this movie not afford an actual british person and every joke was poorly set up and poorly timed by virtually every member of this ensemble it was just not a good comedy in any sense of the wordbr br back by midnight was rated r mainly for language and one scene of nudity the irony in this fact is that many of the jokes are so audience insulting that even kids if you edit out the language would walk out of this film the physical gags are also incredibly predictable especially when alleys pet monkey torments quaids character when the monkey grabs a pair of scissors and jumps on quaids couch who wouldnt know where that gag was goingbr br being a directtovideo comedy of course i didnt expect any oscarwinning material on here the truth is though dangerfield has made some great timeless comedies before easy money and back to school are hilarious still and were definitely not oscarworthy in the slightest however theres a difference between making a dumb comedy thats funny and making a dumb comedy with the latter kind of comedy it seems like the filmmakers dont even try which is precisely the case with this lame excuse for a wasted 90 minutes rest in peace rodney but add this film to your batch of forgettable comedies like meet wally sparks 1997 and the godson 1999 this film dare i say it is not even worth seeing
