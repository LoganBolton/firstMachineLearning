i dont know about you but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york and as far as i am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of catbr br as magical as jerrys exploration of the big apple might be for the other tj fans who have commented here on imdb i couldnt wait for this selfindulgent rubbish to end so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvdbr br in fact the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost buys the farm hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road
