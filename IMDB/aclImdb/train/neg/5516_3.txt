i am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy attempting to be a new millennium crosshybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshalls sentimental direction and mark andrus dark rather confusing screenplay the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel who have driven all the way from san francisco to smalltown hull idaho where grandmother georgia lives the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgias taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17year old has become an incorrigible hellionbr br the setup is clear enough but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees probably due to her offscreen reputation and her scratchy smokers voice lindsay lohan makes rachels promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes  as a petulant resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughters state of mind she does what she can with the role on both fronts but her efforts never add up to a fleshandblood human beingbr br at close to seventy jane fonda looks great even as weatherbeaten as she is here and has the star presence to get away with the cartoonlike dimensions of the flinty georgia the problem i have with fondas casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of oneliners and maternal stares between this and 2005s execrable monsterinlaw it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her it should come as no surprise that the actresses male counterparts are completely overshadowed garrett hedlund looks a little too surferdude as the na√Øve harlan a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his twoyear missionary stint cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lillys husband an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movies endingbr br there is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose tripleplay role of the wounded widower lillys former flame and rachels new boss as town veterinarian dr simon ward laurie metcalf has a barelythere role as simons sister paula while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos some of andrus dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd none all too exciting marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor there are several deleted scenes including three variations on the ending and a gag reel a sevenminute makingof featurette is included as well as the original theatrical trailer a sixminute short spotlighting the three actresses and a fiveminute tribute to marshall
