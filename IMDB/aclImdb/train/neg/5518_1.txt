i havent seen this  dont plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsayunless  until poor little rich girl straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007br br in fact i dont know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsays recent movies i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she cleans up her act all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies br br up to this time movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production now lindsay will probably have to go to auditions  actually compete for any role her reputation is currently poison  quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is inbr br sooooonow lindsay is going to have to deal with not being wantedis she going to be able to handle thisbr br i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv showbr br all of the foregoing is merely my opinion i have no inside information
