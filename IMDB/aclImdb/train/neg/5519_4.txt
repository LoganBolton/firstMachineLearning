okay so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out that is actually not the case its about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and its up to her mother to believe if shes telling the truth or notbr br to be honest i really enjoyed the concept of this movie they had a really good plot and a really good theme of a lovehate relationship between mother and daughter i did not however enjoyed watching lindsay lohans acting in reality this movie would have been great if they had someone else perhaps a better actress the character of rachel lohan is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real lindsay so it takes away a lot from the filmbr br i do however think that if you put lindsay aside you will enjoy this film the ending is pretty great and sad
