ive been going through the afis list of the top 100 comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the 90 movies on the list ive seen but of any movie ive ever seen drunks are funny sometimes dudley isnt liza almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afis top 100 comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill especially if youre as drunk as arthur
