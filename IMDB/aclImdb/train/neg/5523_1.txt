georgia rule has got to be one of  if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least 710 times throughout its grueling two hour coursebr br advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women  jane fonda as the matriarch felicity huffman as her daughter and lindsay lohan as the rebellious over sexed scantily clad granddaughter the viewer thinks this will be a clich√© light chickflick about growing up and coming together as a familybr br talk about false advertisement at it worstbr br after many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctors office weekly to have her diaper changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohans character being sexually abused by her stepfather georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema  the ungrounded horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a dramacomedy then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums sideways junebug and so on and so onbr br the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation say that the movie the 40 year old virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care br br throw in a yellow parakeet dermot mulroney as the flattest most nondimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy tootanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and youve got georgia rulebr br i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etcwho have a lot more talent and arent getting noticedbr br dont see this movie  my rule br br and if you must get sufficiently drunk before hand
