revolt of the zombies is bad there is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie it is dull lifeless poorly acted and poorly scripted ive often complained that the original dracula is a little slow for my taste well this movie makes dracula look like a roller coaster ride the 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutesbr br the story an expedition is sent to cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through zombification one man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him once this happens he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences thats it thats the whole storybr br for most of the movie i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead he looked so familiar i had plenty of time to think this over nothing was happening in the movie just before the zombies revolted it hit me it was dean jagger i had seen him recently as the general in white christmas this is how i entertained myself throughout most of the moviebr br im just glad i didnt buy the dvd for this movie king of the zombies is on the other side and its a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie for what its worth ill give it a 210 i wont go to 110 because believe it or not ive seen worse
