i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldnt take anymore it felt as though id watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit metheres nothing new here ive heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
