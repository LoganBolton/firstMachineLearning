the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie ive ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions and he succeeds at least at first a love triangle complicates the story somebr br this really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who werent the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didnt seem to help the film much eitherbr br while i have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone its bad and not in a sobadthatitisgood kind of way
