before the release of george romeros genredefining night of the living dead zombies were relatively wellbehaved creatures they certainly had much better tablemanners in the old days but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the moviegoing public judging by this film none whatsoeverbr br the story is about an expedition to cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie armybr br this film is basically a love triangle with zombies but seeing as this is a 30s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesheating variety we think of today they seem to respond to mindcontrol rather than insatiable appetites and quite frankly the revolt is somewhat underwhelming too the whole thing is really very dull aside from the lack of horror there isnt any overthetop melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained it seems unlikely that this couldve provided much entertainment even 70 years ago see it if you have to see everything with zombie in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one
