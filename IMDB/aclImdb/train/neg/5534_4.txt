im working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set i am watching them with my soontobe sevenyear old daughter which makes most of these movies a laugh riotbr br i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies after watching white zombie which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema think clive barkers serpent and the rainbow and james bonds live and let die funeral scene not night of the living deadbr br however even though the title includes the word zombies it is little more than a love triangle involving anthropologist armand louque who is smitten with claire duval who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson what a yawnfest my daughter fell asleep halfway throughbr br i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for  the allies or the axis but i guess that doesnt really matterbr br i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie but of course those were his eyes from white zombie serving as the mindcontrol device for the zombies
