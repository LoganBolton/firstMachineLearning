revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features im tired of people arguing that its not that bad and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 i suspect this isnt true its not like iqs have risen sharply in the last 7 decades the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today why just try watching the first scenes and count the pauses between things happening the awful choice of when to cut to closeup the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue im going to make some teago outsideread my book now are you yes i am that sort of exchange happens several times normally i would love that being a huge fan of bad movies but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away this sort of disinterested potboiling timewaster is far worse than energetic imaginative mindblowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians those who claim that this is better than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment its bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom which is far worse
