this is not really a zombie film if were defining zombies as the dead walking around here the protagonist armand louque played by an unbelievably young dean jagger gains control of a method to create zombies though in fact his method is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living peoples minds turning them into hypnotized slaves this is an interesting concept for a movie and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of dr mabuse films including dr mabuse the gambler 1922 and the testament of dr mabuse 1933 here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc√©e claire duvall played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo dorothy stone which is really the major themebr br the movie has an intriguing beginning as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there at some type of compound where we get great 30s sets and clothes he announces his engagement to claire and then barely five minutes later she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal clifford greyson robert noland its unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact this would have been a great movie for mystery science theater 3000 if they hadnt already roasted itbr br its never shown how louque actually learns the zombification secret but he then uses it to kill his enemies create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards we wont see such sheer force of will until john agar in the brain from planet arous 1957br br finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america louque agrees but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his powers to gain her love he does so causing the revolt of the title in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him greyson embraces claire and we seem to be at the end of a parable whom the gods would destroy they first make mad br br so really then its not that bad of a film despite the low imdb rating it currently has on repeated viewings  one can see the artistry in the well formed script dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness  is that really his own hair we remember him more for his bald old man roles in white christmas 1954 x the unknown 1956 and king creole 1958 the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better earlier film white zombie 1932 in which hapless robert frazier as charles beaumont uses zombification to win the love of madge bellamy as madeline parkerbr br if you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds id start with white zombie 1932 king of the zombies 1941 i walked with a zombie 1943 night of the living dead 1968 the last man on earth 1964 and its two remakes in the modern era of classy films there are horror express 1972 the serpent and the rainbow 1988 28 days later 2002 and its sequel as well as many many others too numerous to mentionbr br this one is not really a zombie film judging this movie on its own terms its more of a semigothic romance as such it ranks a little below some of universals bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s so ill give it a 5
