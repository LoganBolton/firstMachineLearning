well first off if youre checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead 1968type film forget it this is about zombies in a more psychological sense where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will but who must instead follow the will of another the zombies here as little as they are in the film are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general as in wartime it is quite a stretch to call this a horror filmbr br the film is set during world war i a french cambodian contingent had heard strange stories about zombificationsupposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombiesand there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes armand louque dean jagger brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification but he wont talk so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to wipe out the white racebr br one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writerdirector victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script the film begins as if it will explore the zombiemilitary metaphor and maybe even have adventure elements but after about 15 minutes it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle storybr br halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power and a nietzschean will to power the film is interesting on that level but the script and the editing are very choppy this is yet another older film for which i wouldnt be surprised if there is missing footage especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialoguebr br amidst the contrived romance story halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread but little of the zombie material makes much sense louque discovers the secret of zombification but it doesnt mean much to the viewer the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusingÂ—halperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosis googlyeyes from his 1932 film white zombie but never explains what it has to do with anything there are big gaps in the plot including the love story promising interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do muchbr br if youre a big fan of old creaky b movies revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least oncethe acting isnt all that bad and if youve got a good imagination you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps but this is the second time ive seen the film with the first only being about five years ago and i could barely recall anything about itso its not exactly memorable
