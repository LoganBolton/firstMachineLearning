while this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film its surprisingly watchable on several levels first for old movie fans its interesting to see the leading role played by dean jagger no relation to mick while jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor even garnering the oscar in this category for 12 oclock high here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair i never saw him this way before and because he was by far the worst actor in the film this film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesnt mean he cant eventually learn to be a great actor another good example of this phenomenon is paul newman whose first movie the silver chalice is considered one of the worst films of the 1950sbr br a second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all the writing is bad the acting is bad and the special effects are bad for example when jagger and an unnamed cambodian are wading through the water its obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them plus once they leave the water their costumes are 100 dry horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the filmso much so that its hard to imagine why they didnt ask bela lugosi or george zucco to star in the filmsince both of them starred in many gradez horror films in many ways this would be a perfect example for a film class on how not to make a filmbr br so while giving it a 3 is probably a bit overgenerous its fun to laugh at and short so its worth a look for bad film fans
