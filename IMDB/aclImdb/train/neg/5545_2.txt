revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesnt necessarily make lightning strike twicebr br the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled closeups of lugosis eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie films rights owners who didnt want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victimsbr br wanna create a mindcontrolled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your ownbr br the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mindcontrol techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isnt worth spitbr br this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments ive ever seen youd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isnt even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age scifi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films im not sure whose favorite film this would be but theyre obviously an idiotbr br not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films
