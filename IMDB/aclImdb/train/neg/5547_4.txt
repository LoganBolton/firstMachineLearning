revolt of the zombies 2 outta 5 stars no this is not a longlost ancestor to the classic george a romero zombie flicks this is a lowbudget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time but seems awfully routine these days there is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers and a closeup of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them the effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 im sure it had audiences gasping the story concerns the search for the secret of mind control ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves the movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snails pace so it seems featurelength believe me there really isnt much to recommend it you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star wading through a swamp the ending is interesting so id say the movie is worth seeing at least once more than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap 4 movies on 1 dvd compilation at walmart for five bucks hey its well worth the money
