though the title includes the word zombies this film is not what youd expect from a movie made today though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected dean jagger portrays armand louque an officer in the french army of world war i who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons or zombies who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war though on whose side is not certain at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon but eventually french general duval george cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient cambodian city of angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy itbr br the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving louque duvals daughter claire dorothy stone and clifford grayson robert noland all a part of the expedition when louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power that advice begins to transform louque particularly after hes successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city having followed a temple priest into a swamp louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking though its not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication all it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control this comes in handy for winning back his girl and taking graysons early advice as he comments to his servant buna were learning to be ruthlessbr br fans of early b horror flicks will recognize the use of bela lugosis signature eye stare plucked from the 1932 film white zombie also from director victor halperin of the two movies white zombie is preferably superior both in story content and in its depiction of the undead where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening in revolt the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentors commands in fact the actual revolt of the title occurs only when louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for claire they overrun his compound and kill him in the processbr br not to be too harsh on the film it plays out decently within the parameters of its story outline but if youre thinking zombies within the traditional context youll probably be disappointed if you want to sample an early treatment of the subject the aforementioned white zombie with bela lugosi is the way to go
