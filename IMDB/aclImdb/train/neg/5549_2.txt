this might mean the end of the white race gasps a general as a dozen native zombies wander around the battlefields of europe during the great war an expedition sets out tor the longlost backprojected city of kennifangor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousandsbr br it is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad from a previous decade it looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on how to act br br  chapter three emotions br br how to express fear and loathing female clench both fists place fist of one hand on heart open mouth as it to scream place other fist palm out against mouth hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sobbr br how to have difficult heavily emotionally charged scene with exfianc√© explaining your love for someone else do not make eye contact do not move do not show any emotion do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall br br to give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors thus 35 minutes worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutesbr br the revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow released from mental bondage the armies of exzombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window yea lets oh i dunnno yeah lets get him grrr frankenstein must be destroyed  manana though i have just found a bit of hidden symbolism jagger is shot by a native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the natives being shot by the germans at the start of the flick see even downtrodden natives dont want the end of the white race the chase it you can call it that through the backprojected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone roy darcy has a hell of a time camping it up but is totally wasted as col mazoviabr br there is one interesting moment in this film a nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell face after face crossfade into one another it works though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut i guess these must be neg cutters frames between the fadesbr br best watched with friends and in a silly mood
