normally im quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films but darkman iii is so appallingly unengaging that i feel nothing but contempt for itbr br it looks and feels like a tv show and a particularly shoddy one at that the sets are sparse the lighting flat the score and effects disjointed and the camerawork is film school 101 theres no plot to speak of the characters are one dimensional and the actors are sleepwalking most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn in fact the only reward that i got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced roxann biggsdawson belanna from star trek voyager without her klingon bumpy head makeup on her skin tone is about two shades lighter than it is in voyager either shes been bleached down for this role or blacked up for voyager very strange either way
