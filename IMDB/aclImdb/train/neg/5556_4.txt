within the first 17 minutes of director bradford mays darkman iii die darkman die we have already been subjected to a silly recap and accompanying voiceover on the first two films hilarious overacting about three minutes of footage simply ripped from the second film and reedited slightly to seem like new footage and a lengthy advertisement the scarred and tormented title character watches about universal theme parks universal being the company that distributed this film yes darkman iii die darkman die is quite the handful when it comes to cheap cashins on the success of a previous filmbr br this time around the disfigured antihero peyton westlake aka darkman portrayed by mummy actor arnold vosloo locks horns with evil crimelord and lousy husband peter rooker played in a brilliantly overthetop performance by jeff fahey and over the course of the 87 minute film grows to develop an affection for rookers wife and daughter once again learning to care for another personbr br blah blah blahbr br this film is basically just a silly way for the studio to make some more money off of sam raimis original film which i consider to be a great actionsuspense filmbr br oh yeah and there are also a number of silly subplots including a villainess who supposedly was one of the original doctors to save darkman following his scarring and her seducing our hero into thinking she is an ally before revealing her nefarious plot to help rooker create more superhuman powered thugs like darkman apparently she cant just do the same procedure on the thugs that she performed on darkman why i cant really explain it because the movie certainly doesntbr br theres also an assassination subplot involving a district attourney who is threatening to bring down rookers organization and some other very silly things going onbr br but it doesnt really add up this film feels like two or three episodes of a television show edited together more than an actual film the direction alternates between pretty good and downright sloppy a scene where darkman rides his trainlike vehicle and dodges a rocketlauncher is just plain silly and the editing is a mixedbag the film just moves too quickly for anyone to really care whats going on and without spoiling it the final 15 minutes of this movie and indeed the entire series is just kinda i dunno another 15 minutes of mixedbag footagebr br in fact commenting on the editing one of my favorite things in this film is watching for footage reused from the previous films and then looking for footage within this film that is repeated multiple times yes its that cheap its one thing to do a recap at the beginning of the film and maybe repeat a shot or two but in the sheer volume they do it minutes of footage repeated from previous films its just sloppy and amateurishbr br also i have to say that darkmans psychedelic montage freakouts are a bit overdone in this film they are so stylized and overdone that they do work but only in light doses and in proper context as raimi did in the original film here there are at least four or five and they feel very abrupt and outofplacebr br that being said the film is not without some good points a few action scenes are welldone the clich√© story of darkman yearning for a real life works suitably for a directtodvd feature some of the acting is nice particularly from rookers wife portrayed by the beautiful roxann dawson also while no danny elfman composer randy miller composes some nice music that builds off of elfmans original themesbr br but overall the film is too quick cheap and silly to be taken seriously arnold vosloo seems alternatively bored and exuberant from scene to scene and fahey while a joy to watch as an overthetop villain just doesnt quite fit in with the seriesbr br like darkman ii i would recommend this to fans of the original who will surely get a laugh otherwise you need not apply a four out of ten
