i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger stallone and even van damme to certain degree he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career the strange thing about jill the ripper or jill ripsor tied up is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb on the dvd case in the commentaries and this film is not serious to call it campy would be a huge understatement the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact its nothing more than shallow confusing and gratuitous on top of that they put lundgren who is known for action films in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller just the plot and premise immediately make it a bmovie porn at very bestbr br dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes and witnesses and everything else even though hes not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren danielle brett is lundgrens eventual love interest and his brothers widow brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless its on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villainbr br i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasnt any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked to explain how classy and well done this movie is sarcasmsarcasm the back of the dvd i picked up it was really cheap has lundgrens character listed as murray wilson not the name of his character in the film while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on its face trying to be serious considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really bmovie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see itno one else shouldcertainly for any sort of mystery or suspense 310
