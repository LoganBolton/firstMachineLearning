ive tried to like this film really in watching it all i can think is this guy gives me the creeps i would have gotten a restraining order it also calls out codependence in capital letters was this really the conversation before making the movie lets make a film that puts two chronically depressed socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are from what ive seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant selfpity br br the mood of the movie is distinctly 80ish brooding and slow dont get me wrong the film has its moments just very few of them
