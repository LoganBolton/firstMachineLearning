yet another colourful excuse for men in rubber suits to wrestle with each other this time around time travellers from the future arrive in 1992 and recruit a few people to go back with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of godzilla thus saving a future japan from destruction but having accomplished this task the time travellers are revealed to be a bunch of double crossers whose own creature goes on the rampage and with no godzilla to stop itÂ… eek it all sounds very silly and it probably is but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good too unfortunately the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish rather than enjoyably rubbish and the movie turns out to be just as dull as its predecessors look out for the shaky spielberg injoke
