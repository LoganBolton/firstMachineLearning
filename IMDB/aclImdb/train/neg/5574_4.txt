godzilla vs king ghidorah is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudopatriotism here travellers from the future try to ruin japan replacing the local hero godzilla with their puppy monster the threeheaded golden dragon king ghidorah they fail however and in the end godzilla fights ghidorah the battles between the two behemoths are very cool but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about japan is great is really stupid the creators of this movie didnt even threat with respect the enemies of japan making them stupid big blond guys who are easily outsmarted by the clever japanese the good thing is that in the end godzilla and king ghidorah nearly destroyed the both japan and its ridiculous enemies in one actually two spectacular combats but till this battle royale the film was really dull and pathetic
