this is one of those movies in which people keep saying thats a great idea about the worst ideas youve ever heard then they act on them i like it this pictures funnier than any 3 dozen seth rogen projects well so is shoah br br gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own originstories since the 60s but this one goes further what can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck this travesty presents a ww2 suicide brigade on the last of the marshall islands presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the us marines away then the japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard they retreat to the mainland where one of them becomes a business tycoonbr br then it gets complicatedbr br blonde men from the future irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating godzilla before he destroys japan the help is questionable as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closedcircuit tv but hey they shot the script you would think that by the 90s the japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships fortunately for nippon the white guys  you can tell theyre american because they say nucyaler  erred by bringing back in time the one japanese girl left in the future in a touching display of ancestor worship she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a sailor moon backpack turns out these timetraveling fashiondisabled caucasians are just jealous of japans impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world in the 22d century japans going to buy africa which sounds more like a liability than an asset these blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace godzilla with king ghidorah who will destroy all of japan except tokyo a strange choice but tohos been known to go out of its way not to have to build that tokyo skyline set againbr br sure enough we are given the alternate spectacle of fukuoka my garden city and some other heretofore unscathedbyrubbermonster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 13 of a hydra in a surprise revelation we are informed that king ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down wait  didnt the spaceship blondes already destroy godzilla yeah they killed him in the third reel but nobody expected that the japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles  ha ha dont worry we dont keep it in japanese waters  with which to jumpstart a new godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur only they dont have to because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made godzilla whole again oh and godzilla finally gets to tokyo reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition they look into each others eyes and godzilla nods as if to say gotta do it man the tycoon nods in understanding then godzilla blows him upbr br i should also mention here that in order to prevent godzillas revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying japan the japanese girl from the future goes back to the future to ask for help from  yes  a balding white man probably because he pities her as the sole asian character from the 23d century he agrees to build a mechaghidora and send it back to the 1990s so that together these two giant monsters can uh fulfill godzillas destiny and destroy japan in a wonderful nod to those notoriously selfwilled whipping heads the girl piloting mechaghidora has trouble controlling the joystickbr br this godzilla suit design owes much to the sumo  his thighs are flabby enough to double for rush limbaughs and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous but theres more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures which makes up for a lot also features a man with a passing resemblance to robert patrick playing a killer robot yes in the future even the robots will have bald spots plus megumi odaka reprising her role as micki the only japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that its not her fault many japanese directors seem to feel that a seventyfoot screen isnt quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face i did some acting for japanese television and i can tell you they push you to go for it they apparently urge their writers in the same way thank god
