in addition to his tarzan series the prolific edgar rice burroughs did write many other books although aside from the popular at the earths core few of these have been filmed one exception is the novel entitled the lad and the lion brought to the screen as the lion man 1936 an overtalkative static oldhat slowmoving and rather dull movie despite being filmed on real desert locations actually movie is the wrong word the narrative doesnt move but proceeds at a snails pace in an abrupt series of jerks for instance at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear even more frustrating for the keen movie fan are the characters who make an impression of sorts like the lass who plies hall with drugged wine but are enacted by players who are not credited the credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns one exception is australian actress finis barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young master fairy admittedly most of the cast are saddled with atrocious king james dialogue which has to be heard to be believed but the way to play this rubbish is tongueincheek a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the films roster of notalent players maybe director jp mccarthy scotched that idea anyway its sad to see the lovely kathleen burke forced to trade lines with the likes of richard carlyle her dad and jon hall her suitor admittedly mr hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than mr carlyle but that is no recommendation
