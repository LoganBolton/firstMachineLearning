i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982 i remember dialogue from tatum oneal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awfulbr br this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakbr br circle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
