its been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a legcrossing that twisted many peoples minds and now god knows why shes in the game again basic instinct 2 is the sequel to the smashhit erotica basic instinct featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas however fans of the original might not even get close to this one since instinct 2 is painful filmmaking as the mediocre director michael catonjones assassinates the legacy of the first filmbr br the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning catherine tramell sharon stone trying to look forcefully sexy is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder a psychiatrist a horrible david morrisey is appointed to examine her but eventually falls for an intimate game of seductionbr br and there it is without no further explanations the basic force that moves this instinct nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy cclass erotic film sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turnoff part of it because of the amateurish writing the careless direction and terrifyingly low chemistry the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldnt be rated nc17 than the first entrance in the series instinct is a compelling torturebr br to top it off everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film the acting here is really bad sharon stone has some highlights but here she gets extremely obnoxious david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and aroused instinct 2 is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well paul verhoeven how i miss youbr br basic instinct 2 never sounded like a good movie and indeed it isnt some films should never get out of paper and that is the feeling you get after watching this now it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this310
