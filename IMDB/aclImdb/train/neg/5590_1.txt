horrible film about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl boring tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the corniest lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and were supposed to believe he looks good for sixty the acting is bad as is the plot the characters are awful as is the story its really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum hes kind of funny this movie is really a waste of time if you are a tatum fan like me  which is why i rented it in the first place  please dont see this movie she is really bad in it and youll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke it wasnt because of bad news bears and little darlings its known she can act well but still dont rent this movie and if youre a fan of burton rent something when he was good looking and not a fossil
