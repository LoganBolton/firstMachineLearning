it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girlbr br this film has a nice conceptthe modern version of sleeping beauty with a twist it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun the result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate for example the scene when the girlplayed by risa goto finally woken by hisyuki kohara kiss instead of being romantic it trys to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the filmbr br i have not read the original story the film is base on it is the wellknown work by the comicbook artist osamu tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories i wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comicbook for instance how did yuki koharas character manage to get to the hospital in an instantwhen its suppose to be a long busride awayto run away risa gotos character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the televisionbr br there are also some scenes that is directly copiedvery uncreative from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie the famous the lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the roman holidaybr br the film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenagerbr br it is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age it would have definitly been on the poster of this filmbr br
