saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film festbr br what can i say against my better judgment i liked it but it seemed to me that that acting was a littleweak mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy i mean the script wasnt stellar to begin with but the actors didnt make me believe the relationshipsbr br the plot is also predictablebr br nonethelss i liked it the characters are likable and the plot is not challenging or upsetting its sweet the characters care about each other and i dont count it as fifty minutes illspent br br but i dont recommend it
