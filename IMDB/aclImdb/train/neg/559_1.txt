i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say  i didnt expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertainingbr br the original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a smut classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to itbr br however this lamebrain waaaybelated sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well lets put it this way  for a 47yearold shes pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesnt look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original  which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnotbr br the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible  and michael catonjones a typically safe director  one who doesnt always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be seriousbr br i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and its very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending  oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable still predictable though i saw gigli i saw son of the mask  and although im not looking to smear this film i can say with my own authority which you dont have to agree with at all mind you that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failurebr br by the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgytype nightclubbr br basic instinct 2  basically it stinks too
