ive heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it a massive murdering of cheerleaders back in 1963 and 1969 eventually cause a cheerleading camp to close up fast forward to 1982 and bambi a former student opens it back up with new recruits among them candy carol kane glenn judge reinhold and sandy debralee scott one by one they are murdered by the killer until only one remains it is then when we find out who did it and whybr br also in the movie are tom smothers doing a terrible accent as a canadian mountie and paul reubens doing his peewee herman schtick the plot overall isnt very well developed and quite lame but some funny scenes do occur namely the house of bad pies and the strip poker scene the ending seems like its thrown together which is a shamebr br overall good for about ten or fifteen minutes total the rest you can just fast forward through maybe catch it on tv but its not worth buying
