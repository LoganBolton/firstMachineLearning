i was curious to watch this movie a lot of people seem to be excited i also have my beliefs i believe in jesus christ but im opened for any kind of views or opinions it doesnt matter for me if jesus existed in the way its written in the bible if maria was a virgin or not or all the other similar pagan coincidences what matters for me is the idea of salvation the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this worldbr br what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written for example they showed in this movie following sentence big those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me jesus lukas 1927 what they didnt tell you is the context jesus told a story about an evil king there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing he is love after quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people pseudochristians filled with hate the majority of viewers dont check the informations presented so they start thinking jesushatenot good for me or for anybody else this is pure manipulation people please use your brain dont take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie we destroy our own basis our civilization if we start dismantling jesus in this way and the message he brought to us you saw off the branch youre sitting on
