its not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoevens original pantsdown shocker  it always struck me as a glossy wellmade airportnovelofamovie thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist after a decade of antisex aidsinduced hysteria a film about a wildlysexual hotbod who thrillkills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy so the fact that its desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sortof be overlooked all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable that it resoundingly fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch lets state the obvious for starters  sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell what was so photogenic thru verhoevens lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gunforhire michael catonjones whos flat drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot i like sharon stone a lot but if the first film launched her career bi2 could kill it she has no chemistry with stuffedshirt david morrissey  their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch his doughfaced mammas boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering orangeskin machismo of michael douglas supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clich√©heavy posturing and what of the muchtouted sexual shenanigans poorlylit fleetinglyglimpsed as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives  the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed dont watch this film for carnal thrills  there are none and what there is is tragic the film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable the last 40 minutes in particular where you come to the realisation that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure as a failed sequel basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2 as a vanity project it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception as a multimillion dollar piece of hollywood filmmaking its a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst
