this documentary begins with an interesting premise  it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth sadly though after priming us with this the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a nonstop attack on christianity and pretty much focusing on the easy targetsbr br the writerdirector clearly has some issues with the church he is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger and this film seems to be his form of release itd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded but as a whole the movie is disappointing
