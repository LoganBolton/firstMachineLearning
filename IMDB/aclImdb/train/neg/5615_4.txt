i watched dvd 1 only the program proper may have 10 minutes of good information otherwise its snotty putdowns of religious people its as if director brian flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his oppositionbr br also flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues and they take over the movie it never gets back on topicbr br religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings arguments from such victimized people seem irrational and therefore unconvincingbr br antireligious people will want more data we dont need to be told that religious people are nutty any more than american jews need to be told how annoying christmas music gets by middecemberbr br in the best scene the superintendent of flemings childhood christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations that seems like the most honest part of the movie and it was too shortbr br if fleming were a bit more selfaware he might have a good story in him about his own past  current relationship to christianity and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youthbr br and perhaps he could lend his christ never walked the earth material to a more serious documentarian im not studying the writings of saulpaul to find out how airtight this all is but a quick browse of wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discreditedbr br the bonus interviews are pretty good tho they dont bolster flemings thesis much sam harris is a good spokesperson for the antireligious pov and he doesnt go light on those other nonchristian religions harris also has some good and easily googled interviews on saloncom  amazoncom  and samharrisorg
