this will be brief let me first state that im agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians especially xtian fanatics however this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games i just couldnt take it seriously mentioning how charlesmanson thought he was christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil i dont know it was just cheap and childish  made the opposition look ignorant furthermore the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious the delivery was complete overkill i cant take this documentary seriously might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games
