im an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film after watching it however i honestly believe that i could have made a better documentary myself its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources despite his being listed in the credits on imdb i didnt see richard dawkins anywhere its edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects and it doesnt make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial the narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering almost adolescent antichristian sentiment ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someones mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir ie me though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of jesus the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the christian school which the director attended as a child an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this daybr br though tgwwt obviously had a low budget there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of christianity theres certainly a dearth of skepticallyminded religious documentaries on the market and this film could have helped fill the void instead the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him its too bad that his christian upbringing traumatized him but he neednt subject an audience to his coping mechanism
