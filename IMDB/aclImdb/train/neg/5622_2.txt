ok aside from the psychedelic background imagery the info presented here was good the music i could have done without not that it was bad music just that it didnt fit this film at allbr br as for the content of the film the director brings up the oftenlacking pagan perspective on christs existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christs life vs the lives of mythological figuresdeities such as mithra and dionyses then he brings up the chronology of christianitys origins and presents an ok case but not one that blew me awaybr br if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them this film would have been good however at this point in the film it disintegrates into a group of personallygratifying attacks on mel gibsons passion of the christ and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth during an interview with his old principal which during the course of it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses i felt that the director was acting sort of childish he was asking good questions but like the film itself the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private schools rules not christianitybr br all in all if youre just interested in some info watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off
