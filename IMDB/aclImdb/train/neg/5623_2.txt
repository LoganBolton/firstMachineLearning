hollywoods attempt to turn jack londons life into a jack london adventure film isnt a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael oshea as london has some londonesque speeches and its nice to see his bearded jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between londons life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting br br  jack london 112443 alfred santell  michael oshea susan hayward virginia mayo
