in his brief 40 years on earth author jack london managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible this 90minute film purportedly a biography of the mans life but patently fictionalized doesnt even scratch the surface and remains a story very ripe for a modernday retelling here michael oshea in one of his first roles portrays london and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic he is not the problem here nor is a young and very beautiful susan hayward playing his future wife charmian whose biography on london is the basis for this film londons life has here been broken down into a series of episodes which the film skips lightly through so we have brief incidents with london as an oyster pirate a sealer in the bering sea a gold prospector in the yukon and a correspondent during the russojapanese warcolorful events for sure but hardly given anything like indepth treatment and alfred santells direction he also directed one of susans first films our leading citizen in 1939 is lackadaisical at best making things rougher here is a very poorquality dvd with a crummylooking print source and hissy sound perhaps the best thing about this movie rental for me was one of the dvds extras a catalog of all the alpha video films featuring hundreds and hundreds of fullcolor movie posters lets just hope that these films are in better shape than jack london
