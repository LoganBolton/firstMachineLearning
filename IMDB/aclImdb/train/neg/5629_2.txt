i just rented yes i paid money to see this film omg it is one of the very worst films i have ever seen as another reviewer put it ms colagrande get out of films please please never make or appear in another film the lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe no thats not fair to the cantaloupe which probably has more going for it she does not know how to act she affects a disgusted look all the time reminded me very much of my alwaysdisgusted young sistersinlaw from europe she is not charming she is not pretty there is no real story and the editing there wasnt any that i could see its pretty bad when you are watching a film and just to get through it you press forward forward on your remote and still nothing happens i mean i kept involuntarily screaming cut cut what were they thinking well obviously they thought they would make a film together and get paid to make love on screen pretty good deal for them pretty raw deal for the viewer i think im going to throw up now
