i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one mild spoilers starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse the poor of london coming out to sing fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset not exactly faithful to the novel as i recall dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison end of spoilersbr br oliver reed is very weak as sykes doing little more than growling to indicate his evil worst however is mark lester as oliver who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if hes really the main character his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl guess they didnt realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in englandbr br selfrespecting dickens fans stick to david leans amazing 1948 film or the bbc 6hour adaptation from the mid80s avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical
