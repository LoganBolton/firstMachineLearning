i watched the dvd called black widow in the usa and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or i missed a lot the sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity not even a breast but ive read several other comments on imdbcom mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon i did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with unlikable characters and a trite sophomoric plot giada colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or botoxed to the gills and nary an expression touches her face and her name makes me think of supersizing a beverage at taco bell ill have the cola grande it was actually kind of fun it was so bad i got to play like i was in my own mystery science theater 3000 noting things like the fact that dafoes skin is too big for his face its really like silly putty
