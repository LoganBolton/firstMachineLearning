italianborn eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover karl an ultramodern and isolated house in the middle of the woods its winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house but also that of eleonora as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pairbr br what was i expecting a thriller indeed but it wasnt quite so thats just the advertising on the package for ya im quite perplex about everything the title the story and the motivation so how to classify it well this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance boundstory of alienation possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals cowriter along with william dafoe and director giada colagrandes arthouse film is just too clinical distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean although when its sudden conclusion materialises youll thinking why should i actually care what we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments but more so make for an leaden experience as it never delves deep enough like it believes it does the sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic they are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow the base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh but its never fulfilling and i thought therell be more to it then all of this dreary lingering colagrandes direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines but everything feels like its in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views most of the action stays at the one location the house camerawork is potently taut but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes giada colagrande plays it sensually and william dafoe sleep walks the part he looks dog tired while seymour cassel pokes his head in now and thenbr br just where is it heading is anyones guess well thats if you can wait around for it i think ill give it the benefit of the doubt as its definitely not what i was expecting from this indie film
