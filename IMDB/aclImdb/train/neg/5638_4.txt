only one thing could have redeemed this sketch a healthy gunfight between the happy couple the exotic model at the delicatessen and the oldtimer from the motel who was it would have turned out secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rentboy to the guys when theyd shared the rubber house br br in the process they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens resolved most of the snags such as the whore bitch ode on the windscreen the reason why the protagonist had no friends as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon incessant phone calls    and that crawlspace chic the green thumb and his attraction to the simpler life quite the technician with the human body though exabortionist morgue attendant a bit of a heartbeat would have been nicebr br it was fun watching these people move around i guess but eleanoras silly italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes a dick a mind and a pickup truck about summed it up for him i also wished they could have had a bit more luggage eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motelbr br trifling matters you may well say i agree although the niggling bits just didnt add up right in this rush job good owlwrangling though and i really felt cold all the way through
