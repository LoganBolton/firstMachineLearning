i am a huge willem dafoe fan and really sought out this film i had to get a region 5 chinese dvd of it but it is truly one of the worst that ive seen in quite a whilebr br the acting except for dafoe is horrible dafoe and colagrande both wrote and directed this  though he isnt credited as a director and they have no discernible talents for writing or directing stick to acting willem giada get out of the business pleasebr br absolutely nothing happens except a series of completely unconvincing totally without believable motivation acts by these two people that just met in this house colagrandes sleepy i couldnt care less expression practically never changes and the sex scenes are downright lame i actually cringed twice at one of them yuck theyre definitely not the least bit erotic and yet are the only time the film isnt putting you to sleep then its busy repulsing youbr br just awful
