whatever happened to british tv drama from john major through tony blair the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative womenfocused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionalsbr br or perhaps tvnz doesnt buy the good stuff please let that be what it isbr br the writers long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clich√©s niamh cusacks performance is strong on meaningful looks each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve baleful looks however are a poor substitute for depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with br br of course this is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation but thats not as important as the central characters failing marriage and its attendant problems is cusacks characters husband a complete bastard will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up making these the central issues isnt a sign of insight  it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her jobbr br lynda la plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics  evidently paula milne isnt up to the task
