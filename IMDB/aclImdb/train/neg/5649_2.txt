i dont think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i tolerated the first seasonbr br unfortunately this is a show about lawyers who arent really lawyers god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me gag a bitbr br that aside spader and shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying while this might be a compliment in some situations its certainly not here their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first but since thats what theyre doing literally all the time ive realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get trying to intersperse some serious dramatic and even tearjerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest ive been experiencing trying to enjoy the showbr br alan shores flamboyant and gratuitous public service announcements where he spouts off his opinions do not impress denny crane is just annoying i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for cranes speech wearing a colonial outfitbr br im giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the shows attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with carebr br i think the shows writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start the thing is i dont care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more im not a teenager anymore and i think this show is promising if its goal wasnt to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratingsbr br of course im writing this after i realized that its really not gonna get much better than this its a shame because its one of those shows id love to love
