this isnt a bad movie but its the type your girlfriend makes you watch the story isnt bad  it just makes the hour and a half seem so long its hard for me to trash this movie because i really do like the idea of it but it was just to long and thin on story too bad the main character never really seems to change all that much from beginning to end  i mean goes through something life changing and he can barely break a smile i really thought mac was really good his weird quirkiness kept the movie from being a complete disaster maybe i just dont get this film if anyone can explain it to me id love to be informed
