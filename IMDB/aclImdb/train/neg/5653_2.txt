lets put it this way i actually get this movie i get what the writerdirecter was trying to do i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless i understand that the plot was supposed to be nonclimactic and stale that was what the writerdirector was going for a very very very dry humorcomedy with all that understanding i still think the movie sucked it seemed like the writerdirector was trying to recreate napolean dynamite with this movie it had all of the same features even the main character behaved similar to napolean but napolean dynamite was actually funny its script worked this movie is not it has no purpose well let me rephrase that its only purpose is to rip off napolean dynamite and try to capture that look and feel too bad it didnt work
