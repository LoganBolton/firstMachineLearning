i never heard of this film til it played as part of a robert mitchum retrospective at the national film theatre in london almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names  in addition to topbilled mitchum  in the public domain charles mcgraw not long off the killers barbara bel geddes long before dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of theatre set designer norman walter brennan who needed no introduction frank faylen the sadistic male nurse in the lost weekend and the much nicer smalltown mensch in its a wonderful life robert preston still a decade away from harold hill in the music man with tom tully and phyllis thaxter making up the numbers alas most of them were wasting their time i looked in vain for any signature scenes given that it was robert wise on bullhorn by this time hed made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style the story is our old friend the range war and mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the hopalong cassidy oaters on which hed cut his teeth there are no new twists  if you dont count the unbelievable scene when mitchum accuses preston of sleeping with thaxter to gain information about her fathers plans to move his cattle this is perfectly true but how did mitchum know weve seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it on balance not a lot to be said for this
