im a great admirer of lon chaney but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me the story jumps around oddly ive since learned that the film is missing a section and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness some of the intertitles are overly explanatory eg why youre not a child anymorecut back to picture for a long slow beatyoure a woman yes we got it the first time but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear lets hear luigi and his blond girlfriends argument please the plot which involves incestuous desires figuratively if not technically was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch to the writers credit this issue was treated as a problem and a maydecember match is not portrayed as the rightandgood inevitability of some mary pickford films eg daddylonglegs chaney gives a good performance as usual but i think he has been betterdirected in the pasthe overdid it a few times here imho i did enjoy the clown sequences and was very impressed at the stunts loretta young was charming though astonishingly young the film has its moments but so far its my leastfavorite chaney picture
