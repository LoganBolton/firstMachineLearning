a disappointing end to a season that started so well br br exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on tv in any series where as this was rather badbr br well i am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original seriesbr br its almost as if the corporate execs didnt like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up they failed and rather spoilt everythingbr br lets hope this is not a trend for the futurebr br still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done
