when i read most of the other comments i felt they were way too glowing for this movie i found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen its often best to just let things be i completely agreed with the star trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the first star trek movie to the original seriesmillions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the originalbr br the plot is at times incomprehensible it is terribly gory though the recent new zatoichi by beat takeshi is much bloodier and lacks the heart of the originals i didnt mind the blood at all but some may be turned off by it particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads in addition time has not been good to ichihe seems a broken and sad man in this film much much more than usualand thats something fans of the series may not really want to seebr br this was a very sorry return for zatoichi unless you are like me and want to see every zatoichi film this one is very skipable see one of the earlier versions or the 2003 allnew version
