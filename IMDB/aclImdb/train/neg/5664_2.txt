i liked boyles performance but thats about the only positive thing i can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9yearold nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stonehearted cop or an ultraevil villain the raspy voiceovers seemed amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music and whats with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story thats a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges stories so good is his minimalism  they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts i wasted 4 renting this but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake
