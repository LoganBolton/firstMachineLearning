this wilfully bizarre adaptation of borges short story is typical cox his strong visual sense is as usual undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast the film is definitely in the surreal tradition of bunuels mexican period and looks at times like a poor mans take on lars von triers elements of crime coxs apparent preference for single takes jump cuts and ambient sound recording all work against the films effectiveness worth a look but ultimately disappointing
