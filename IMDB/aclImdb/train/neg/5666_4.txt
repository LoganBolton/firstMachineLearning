i respect alex cox the filmmaker i really do hes like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be different a literary punkrocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringeculture and come out into the world ready to take s on but then you see what he can actually do the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer but theres two sides to his proverbial coin he can either really hit it out of the park repo man sid  nancy walker arguably or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious rabbits out of the hat straight to hell death and the compass falls into the latter category and while i respect its mostly original approach to tackling a detectivekiller story it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dullbr br it has a strange enough setup and already irreverent style to follow a detective erik lonnrot is after a killer with a hellfire voice red something and it seems that the killer is leaving disturbing clues with his victims scrawled in blood on the walls are messages that according to eyewitness alonso zunz christopher eccleston looking as if he just walked off shallow grave without changing his look has religious significance in the kabbalah we follow lonnrot on his case and his methods of going after the perp which include following at first a triangular and then compassshaped pattern on the map this despite the protests of the flabbergasted commissioner treviranus miguel sandoval who also looks back in flashforwards sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in garbled but sad descriptions of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the casebr br oh cox has his moments of creativity and interest such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where ecclestons character is taken in by handcuffs for his own protection says lonnrot in case of getting lost in the wrong room and were followed in a long tracking shot maybe the best or just most curious where were taken through very dark hallways with very little direction lost in the maze of turns and oddities among the characters and its never something that isnt fascinating to look at with miguel garzons cinematography a morbid delight but the plot goes through hoolahoops to keep things so offbeat it might as well be beatless alltogether the performances save for a confident boyle and for eccleston at the very end are pretty bad especially sandoval who just seems to squirm in his seat reciting the goofy dialog given to him to speak at the audiencebr br while the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this isnt something weve seen before that its in a society with a good many rioters and architecture suggesting alphavilles next decrepit wave it too fizzles out very quickly whats the conflict here i was never that much engaged with boyles own personal mission to find this killer and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer andor killers going after people like in the building early on cox himself has an amusing cameo and just when i started to think it was leading up to something spectacular with boyle and eccleston in that big not as big as you think building in the south section of the city it suddenly gives us a twist that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope isnt and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery its been leading up to for all of coxs uncanny touches as a filmmaker for all of his opposition to spoonfeeding the audience with a conventional approach which i do respect death and the compass ultimately cuts one off at the brainstem its masturbatory
