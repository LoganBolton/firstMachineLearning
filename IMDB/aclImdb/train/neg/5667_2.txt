had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix id have a couple of hours of my life back im frankly suspicious when i see that a films director also wrote it in this case according to the credits the same guy was writter and director  unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there were a few interesting moments eg judy tenutas scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judyism which led me to rate this two stars rather than one those moments however were few and far between  and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once id seen the whole thing nope though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later the spinning camera technique was overused and essentially pointless i found myself talking to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommended
