the only reason the norliss tapes deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast other than getting to see angie baby in a prepolice woman performance theres nothing else worth seeing herebr br the synopsisbr br  minor spoilers br br david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the norliss tapes  a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernaturalbr br in the pilot episode a wealthy sculptor dies  but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death we soon discover the ring itself doesnt grant immortality instead it only reanimates the sculptors corpse allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their bloodbr br bluefaced yelloweyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you havent heard since you last watched scooby doo cartoons the sculptor attacks his wife dickinson one dark night she escapes and via a mutual acquaintance contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husbands uncanny reappearance on her estatebr br so is this guy a vampire no theres no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard the sculptor doesnt drink his victims blood  he collects it how dont know we only see him attacking never collecting why to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a lifesize statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood once its finished sargoth plans to inhabit the statue using it as his gateway into our worldbr br the final analysisbr br the norliss tapes wasnt picked up as a series for a very good reason it was garbage as you can see from my synopsis the story is a paltry illconceived mess the acting and dialogue offer no better this isnt even a contender for a so bad its good award sometimes bad is just badbr br after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of the norliss tapes i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 101503 i wish i hadnt set myself up for the fallbr br having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago i can only assume any applause youve heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis either way theyve offered you misleading reviews of the norliss tapesbr br pauly orchid  october 17 2003
