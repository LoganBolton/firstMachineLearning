after having seen and loved postal yes i actually loved postal i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvdstore and its supposed to be one of his better filmsbr br while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films ive seen so far including a massive amount of plot holes unrealistic emotional responses and subpar acting it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it maybe he should stick to comedy the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch which ruined my experience altogether there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes but they seem to be there for the shock value alone and lets not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at timesbr br i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then seed just isnt one of those
