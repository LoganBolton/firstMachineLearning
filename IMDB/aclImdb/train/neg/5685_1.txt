the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horrorcult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism youre actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype you know like its popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not let me just assure you that this is not the case uwe boll is a terrible writerdirector and quite frankly a menace to the entire filmmaking industry seed is another most unfortunate of proof that in here boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist like a plot a narrative structure character development tension building seed is a hideous movie full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage i once read that seed was uwe bolls interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks but thats not even close the film inarguably does borrow some influences from saw and hostel but basically its just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence br br the first 45 minutes of seed are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen for you see boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a hyper fast scrolling text explaining theres a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail so you know this will happen later on but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims exaggerate much who wears a bag over his head he watches reallife animal cruelty footage and thus we watch reallife animal cruelty footage thanks for that mr boll and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted when hes finally captured during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed and put on death row the film even becomes more retarded after being buried alive because the electric chair couldnt fry him max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him br br the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad theyre downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic multiple twists and sub plot in seed are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because theyre just too dumb nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him seed is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes personally i refuse to accept that the cast  crew members didnt notice this as well it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to i imagine his yelling stuff like shut up and do as you are told to his actors whenever they remark that the scene theyre shooting doesnt make a lick of sense br br just for the fun of upsetting people theres a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst shes tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room instead of shocking as boll intended it to be this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is seed is horrendous its disgusting its pitiable its  boll
