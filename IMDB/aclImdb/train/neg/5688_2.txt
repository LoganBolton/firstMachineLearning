short version seed isnt worthless its just derivative and inferior and soullessbr br long version if you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguelydefined psychological horror genre this movie will probably melt your face off maybe not but it will give you a good burn the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutalityonvideo and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film hasbr br but thats if you dont have much experience with the genre if youve seen the real thingaugust undergrounds penance for example you will as i did find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the filmbr br other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old i understand this comparison like the video nasties seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasonsthose that are still popular had something special permit me to be ambiguous i think you will understand those that have stuck around had soulbr br take this quote from gabriele crisanti director of burial ground on an interview on the newish dvd we will never have more films like these because today technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold so many things will disappear because small films like these wont be produced anymore today we have great exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold today a horror a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars these films were not so expensivethey are real effects made with our handsbr br perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously but crisanti has hit the nail on the head even at their most seemingly exploitational the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive truth and this is where boll falls short its like hes seen the movies and not understood them everything on the checklist is therebs about making a statement about humanity an obscene torture scene etc but it is as crisanti puts it cold the gore is all cgi the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres and the pacing is sooooo slow man so slowbr br another interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video gamebr br anyway enough bs weak movie
