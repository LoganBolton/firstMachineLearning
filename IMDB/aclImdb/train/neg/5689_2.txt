over the past year uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker cranking out the competent in the name of the king a lord of the rings clone and the proudly vulgar post911 satire postal but then came seed and the counter was reset to zero keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach and im a fan of the guyÂ–his films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision and are never dullbr br spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received seed is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombies successful reboot of halloween the antagonist is maxwell seed will sanderson a mute hulking brute whos slain 666 people and sits on death row awaiting execution after unsuccessfully frying the beast he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him thereand so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhembr br trying to create a newmillennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression ultimately resembling a washedup pro wrestler doing the toolbox murders on a succession of equally boring victims furthermore seeds character and bolls message run contrary to one another the death penalty is wrong sure but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer whos left a couple hundred corpses in his wake i think notbr br meanwhile michael pare acts like a listless longlost brother to james remars character on dexter a cop who sits at his desk a lot thumbing through newspaper clippings and watching pointless stopmotion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seeds lair by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seeds hideout the sequence is so drawnout illconceived the lighting is almost nonexistent and unexciting despite a healthy dose of gore that it almost put me to sleepbr br the shoddy filmmaking isnt limited to just that sequence seed appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly a technique thats more stomachturning than the gore itself these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering almost nonexistent narrative at 90 minutes the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture which might have been bolls intent all alongbr br pure geniusi guess the jokes on me
