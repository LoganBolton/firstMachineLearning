consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll somewhere perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said you dont talk about at parties boll knows that david lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him gore whores metalheads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the teutonic helmsmans output so bereft of originality wit or imagination that hes become the internets bogeyman  an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement boll does his best to ride over these naysayers exploiting tax credits available in germany and canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as zero mostel did with old ladies in the producers the difference being that mostels character knew he was making bowel fill maybe uwe knows it toobr br such is the level of hostility toward each new bollbuster that imdb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before theyve seen it bolls attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined indeed hes probably the only filmmaker thats boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbagebr br this onslaught has made uwe a very thick skinned man so much so that he must feel like hes wrapped in a carpet but one who feels as if hes bullied by the entire world like most people in that situation he lashes out determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding varietys review of house of the dead never too far from the surface this i know you are but what am i strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of postal which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 911 christian fundamentalism jihad nazism and paedophilia such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of peter cook and the visual imagination of chris morris but the closest boll gets to either man is the o in their surnamebr br in seed shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer is there any other kind who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free though if youd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to they pronounce him legally dead and bury him only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolersbr br boll begins his exploration of nihilistic rage with seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes from there were treated to the killers stock in trade  kidnapping dogs babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food were invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are  our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition yes were worthless gormless sadists and worse than that we wont give uwe a good rating on the imdb in short humanity is bunkbr br of course you might think that uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind its a bit of a bipolar piece on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old boll has had to drink for so long while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girthbr br the result says nothing about society and its discontents more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director poor uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasys about dispatching various web critics that its there but takes an avantgarde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread shows that boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements hes made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate i wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun boll told the audience at the films world premiere and he has on that flimsy manifesto succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the directors detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker hell need something genuine to say as well as a better more original way of saying it
