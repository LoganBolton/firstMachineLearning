i cant believe the positive reviews of this movie  i thought it was one of the worst most poorly executed and poorly acted movies i have ever seen and the plot was completely ludicrous sp she starts making out with him while hes tied to the chair puhlease the worst part was that it wasnt even bad in a good laughable way just plain terrible  i couldnt figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo i thought belushi was ridiculously silly  very unbelievable as an eccentric hit man idk i could go on  again i am shocked by the positive reviews the only thing that kept me watching it is that its fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad and the ending didnt disappoint in its silliness either live by the sword die by the sword ridiculous
