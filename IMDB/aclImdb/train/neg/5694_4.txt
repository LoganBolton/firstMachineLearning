ill be honest the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandlers most notably from early edition since he usually plays the good guy i wanted to see him as in a different role out of curiosity the plot itself also drew me in a wannabe hitman tony greco aka mr chandler must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life or rather the death of a witness who will testify against someone in the family the movies was nothing like i expected it was sick i hated the end if you saw it youd know why and there were so many unnecessary parts basically it was filthy and made little sense yes it was a mob movie and yes the guns do go boom but theres more to a movie than that this film acted as if it didnt have the time to go into detail just deal with it and understand it the acting really made up for it james belushi was pretty amusing as the rose sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get she surprised me the most and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to the family if only the script did justice to the actors
