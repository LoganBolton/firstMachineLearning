thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey john carpenter and tommy lee wallace this movie sucks on so many levels its pathetic the first vampires was fun but this low budget retread makes me yawnbr br jon bon jovi the poor mans kevin bacon drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderass guitar case in desperado he picks up some lame hunters along the way including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest to walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so if youve seen the first vampires youve already seen this and done much betterbr br john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately frankly i think hes past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic the only decent film hes done since they live 1987 is vampires everything else is complete crap right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars and now this waste of celluloid where are more greats like assault on precinct 13 halloween 1 escape from new york and the thingbr br carpenter crony wallace proves he cant write his way out of a paper bag with his paperthin script packed with yawns groans and recycled gags from the original did i mention i hated every character in the movie there was not a single memorable character in the whole film how does that happen this film has nothing to recommend it not even the dvd presentation is good the menu looks awfulbr br by comparison jason x friday the 13th in space was a masterpiece now that is how you make a sequel and reenergize a franchise ladies and germs as well as create an exciting dvd menu
