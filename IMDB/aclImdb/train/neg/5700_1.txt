how this film gains a 67 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 20 and clearly should rank among imdbs worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler throughbr br i love the justifications for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider kinsey the woodsman million dollar baby or sideways national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this havent even heard of them since some havent been widely released yetbr br nicholas cage is a terrific actor  when he is in the right movies time after time ive seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mindnumbing films like con air the rock and faceoff when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufmans adaptation he is an incredible actorbr br bottom line  id rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again
