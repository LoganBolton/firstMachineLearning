what a disappointment i hated the mummy but this one was even worse it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time i cant believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas cage wasnt very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around americas most wanted buildings the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasnt very convincing either i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment what a drag i guess ive just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure
