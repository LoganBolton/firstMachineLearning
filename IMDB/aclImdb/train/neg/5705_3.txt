national treasure 2004 is a thoroughly misguided hodgepodge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates how precious is that i ask you a seemingly normal fellow who for no other reason than being of a lineage of likeminded misguided fortune hunters decides to steal a national treasure that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably unintentionally like indiana jones meets the patriot the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a stanley goodspeed regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane but disconnected misadventuresbr br the relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a kings ransom someplace on native soil and then going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout us currency art work is something that director jon turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining couldnt washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country hence we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth bens intentions are noble  if confusing hes set on protecting the treasure for who and whenyour guess is as good as minebr br but there are a few problems with bens crusade first up his friend ian holmes sean bean decides that he cant wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives oh yeah  brilliant idea presumably the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune so ian tries to kill ben the assassination attempt is of course unsuccessful if overly melodramatic it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up and pick on the very sultry curator of the archives abigail chase diane kruger she thinks ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning but true to actionromance form abbys resolve melts quicker than you can say is that the hope diamond the film moves into full xfileish mode as the fbi mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multilayering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive honestly dont those guys ever get intelligence information that is correct in the final analysis national treasure isnt great film making so much as its a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies woven together from scraps the likes of which would make il betsy ross blushbr br the buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors natural flesh tones solid blacks and clean whites the stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements the audio is 51 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made if only as an audience we had had more clarification as to why ben and co were chasing after an illusive treasure this might have been one good flick extras conclude with the theatrical trailer audio commentary and deleted scenes not for the fainthearted  just the thickheaded
