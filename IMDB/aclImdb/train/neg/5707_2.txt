i watched this movie last night on one of the payperview channels and while watching it i quickly wondered why i bothered in all honesty i really did expect something more from this film maybe something along the lines of conspiracy theory why maybe because of the casting i mean nicolas cage and harvey keitel after all not to mention jon voight and christopher plummer now im wondering why did they bother but instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama i was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a l√† the goonies which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise perhaps its because the goonies was clearly targeted toward the preteen and teen audiences whereas national treasure judging from the previews was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audiencebr br suspension of disbelief is one thing its how one can enjoy scifi and horror but i found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracyladen tripe being shoved at the audience oh the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment wow the masons the knights templars you know this could really be true i think the writer really lost me when gates said the founding fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the british and just were did the knights templar come from new jersey oh i forget from france which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in philadelphia during the revolution it was brought there by agents of napoleon anyway you see what im getting at the premise of the movie is interesting and i really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama but it just comes off as another kid flick in grownup clothing in the end i think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degreebr br ive just finished watching several items by werner herzog and istvan szabo its a shock to switch from fine dining to hollywood big mac and friesbr br okay okay if you pant over chases explosions and geewhiz gimmickry youll enjoy national treasure but its the sort of movie well have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out and all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like wow did you see how that thing blew up that was so cool national treasure is that kind of movie
