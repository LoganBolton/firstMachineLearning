well it looked good on papernick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci codeamerican history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable castincluding john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasonshowever these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar and nobody mention from hell or jack the ripperi dont think ive revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour
