national treasure is about as overrated and overhyped as they come nicholas cage is in no way a believable action hero and this film is no indiana jones people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rockerbr br i cant really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for maybe the preteen audience will like it but i found it to be absolutely ludicrous i also cant imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film simply put its just ok at bestbr br national treasure is unimagined and uninspired borrowing what it does have from the da vinci code i would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 and passing on this nonsensebr br the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the declaration of independence and run around all over washington dc and philadelphia with it while never damaging it once while fighting the bad guys and experiencing what is supposed to be nonstop action is absurd i particularly loved the scene with the declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it oh brother br br reminded me of that episode of the brady bunch where they go to the amusement park and mr brady loses his architectural plans except that episode of the brady bunch was much better than this whole film br br the idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the us is outlandish literally there are thousand of undiscovered priceless items in this treasure trove yeah right ridiculous br br even worse the speed and accuracy of which cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be tough clues to these ancient riddles are preposterous oh the humanity br br the performances by cage voight and the other actors in national treasure are as stiff wooden and flat as they come however when youre working with such lousy dialogue its hard to fault the actors 100 for thatbr br national treasure is an ok film to see once i cant recommend it beyond that and would definitely not purchase this over the top outlandish scavenger hunt of a messbr br rent it if you must see it first
