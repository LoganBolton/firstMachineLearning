after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the us propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat its the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and theres also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up shes clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says dont you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like shes a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that its so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy
