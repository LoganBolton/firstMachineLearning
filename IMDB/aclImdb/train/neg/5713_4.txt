theres nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience insteadbr br its only my opinion but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters as far as likability is concerned the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple nicely done unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalkerbr br 1 after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel youre staying at when you drop him offbr br 2 beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assaultbr br 3 dont bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by himbr br 4 while trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps herbr br 5 after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him oneonone no point in being unfair right br br now id never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that its effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety since they are victims of their own doing this kills the enjoyability of the entire film br br in case you were wondering the scriptwriters didnt stop with dimwitted characters since they themselves are surely dimwitted for writing this crapfest they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the windowbr br 1 the stalker kills a cop inside a police station Â– while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet awaybr br 2 the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behaviorbr br 3 the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human beingbr br 4 the suspense scenes had no imagination whatsoever in fact some scenes were direct ripoffs from american moviesbr br the only positive is the decapitation near the end which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife its too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left fieldbr br truly the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves better yet they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
