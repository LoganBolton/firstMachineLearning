whoa nelly ive heard a ton of mixed reviews for thisbut one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing man was he right on the nose this movie was acted by pure amateurs they had to have done one take maybe two on each scene the movie seemed soooo rushed the script was also poorthey had lines that tried to be unique but failed miserably get your meathooks off of me oh man i hate it when movies try to do that it happens all the time with comediesbut with a horror movie and with below average actorsthe results are incredibly pathetic the lines and scenarios were all very predictable but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was again the damn acting it was awful besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth i thought he was greatbr br the movie is about 5 stupid dumbsht tourist who are on a vacation in asia they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sexslaughterhouse sounds like a cool story but watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing there wasnt a trace of suspensebr br i like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this but unfortunately with a huge capital u the movie was incredibly disappointing i did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects the flabby chicks were also so sobr br everything about this movie screams amateur this is ryan nicholsons first feature length and for the most part he failed theres no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror i pray his next movie doesnt play out like another b horror flickunless he tells us thats what its gonna be even after this disappointment im willing to give ryan another shot from what ive seen of him hes a true dedicated man to the genre good luck next time because this was bad news
