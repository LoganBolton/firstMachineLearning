this movie is a lot like the movie hostel except with bad acting and not much suspense the gore elements are there but you dont really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective some parts are just strange like forcing a snake down someones throat whats up with that is that supposed to be scary or gory its just kind of stupid as for torture there really isnt any except for the guy getting blowtorched in the beginning which they dont show anyway the main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast the deaths are all relatively quick yes i did watch the unrated version so overall not the worst gore movie ive seen but not at all good either you wont miss anything if you skip this one
