i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john carpenters vampires los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film jeepers creepers anyonebr br a tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time its not even comically badbr br what we end up with is a dull uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clich√©d acting it just reeks of low budgetbr br avoid like the bubonic plague
