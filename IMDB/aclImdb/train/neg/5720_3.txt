some gorehoundfriends recommended live feed to me and basically i cant really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema the socalled torture porn ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models hostel and saw with its sick  twisted makeup effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked coeds tried up suffering and begging for their lives theres no actual plot to describe five utterly brainless twentysomething friends take a trip to asia one of them has asian roots but other than that i dont really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun theyre clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan a simply apology clearly doesnt suffice as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat yikes live feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook even if youre used to watching independent fanboy trash cinema like this the fat bloke depicted on the cover an oriental sm executioner is admittedly quite cool and hes also the most talented of the whole bunch because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time i wouldnt exactly recommend this pile of filth but hey if you like loud  hideous metal music nauseating torture footage and dimwitted losers go right ahead and watch
