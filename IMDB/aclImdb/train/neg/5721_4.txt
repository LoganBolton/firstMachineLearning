i wasnt at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knockoffs are just as bad or worse  yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7foot leatheraproned butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater doubling as a hideout for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have differed greatly unfortunately most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revengetype scenario so basically it is just a lowbudget hostel ripoff with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say dont bother with this one
