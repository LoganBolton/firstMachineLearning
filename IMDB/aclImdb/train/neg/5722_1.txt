first id like to excuse my bad englishbr br im not a hostelhardcorefan but i liked that movie nevertheless live feed however sucked big time i have never seen a goremovie with superb acting but hey whos surprised the acting in live feed was well not there ive seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something okey but not by students in media or acting school this was no class at all and what about the story a really sad ripoff on hostel and what about the gore what about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you coldsweating that was the most disappointing about the hole movie short quick and no edge more like an execution rather than a torture okey there where buckets of blood but it didnt even look real the slaughtering and the violence reminded more of braindead than hostel or any of the sawmovies and braindead was fun okey i laughed at live feed a couple of times but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer funbr br so instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching live feed watch anything else
