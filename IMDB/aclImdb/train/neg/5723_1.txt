anyone who has said that its better than hostel is talking complete crap believe me im not a fan of hostel but this is just ridiculous this is just another shot on camcorder straight to dvd low on ideas waste of your time i cant believe how many of these films there are and im yet to see a decent one in the 80s video nasties gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this then i guess these films will keep appearing this film is so low on ideas its just amazing how it ever got made the acting is also terrible the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief this waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it unless youre on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time my bestworst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they dont back off you can see that she isnt even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip an absolute joke
