i agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting yes there was a lot of gore and some nudity but it was overshadowed by a slowmoving meaningless plot and dumb ending where was this supposed to be filmed anyway a canadian chinatown or hong kong hostel was a much better movie and i would recommend seeing that instead a technical annoyance i had with the dvd is that if you shut off the spanish subtitles they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again also dont waste your time on the deleted scenes because theres no audio and it just looks like tourist footage
