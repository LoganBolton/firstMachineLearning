2005 gave us the very decent gore porn flick hostel and 2006 gave us live feed a not so decent ripoff of hostel live feed follows pretty much the same formula as eli roths earlier film except this time the dumb kids are in asia rather than central europe the plot focuses on these dumb kids and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble the locals decide to lock them all in a theatre and kill them despite the fact that id heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it i still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director ryan nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film torched but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring the film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of grindhouse cinema which hostel did successfully but it really doesnt come off surprisingly considering nicholsons previous work in special effects  not even the gore is impressivealthough it is a lot better than the acting theres not much else i can say about this filmits bad and not in a good way avoid it
