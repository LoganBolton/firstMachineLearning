live feed is set in some unnamed chinesejapanese asian district somewhere as five american friends sarah ashley schappert emily taayla markell linda caroline chojnacki mike lee tichon  darren rob scattergood are enjoying a night on the town  taking in the sights after a scuffle in a bar with a japanese triad boss stephen chang they decide to check out a porno theatre as you would inside they are separated  quickly find out that the place belongs to the triad boss who uses it to torture  kill people for reasons which arent made clear can local boy miles kevan ohtsji save thembr br this canadian production was cowritten produced  directed by ryan nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well one has to say that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety  success of hostel 2005  the mini craze for torture porn as its become known according the imdbs trivia section for live feed writer  director nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres for my money i reckon he wrote it after watching hostel the script is pretty poor there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing  killing people none was it for the triads was it for his pleasure was it to make snuff films to sell some sort of explanation would have been nice also why did he turn on the triad boss at the end if your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about live feed it seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex sm horror torture gore  action films which doesnt come off i mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isnt automatically going to make your film any good there still needs to be a decent script  story right the characters were fairly poor clich√©s  some of their actions  motivations were more than a little bit questionable it moves along at a reasonable pace its fairly sleazy mixing gore sex  nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effectbr br director nicholson doesnt do anything special here the editing is choppy  annoying he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea  the film has a cheap look about it available in both r  unrated versions i saw the shorter cut r version which really isnt that gory but i am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the unrated version  say that it might be much much gorier but i cant say for sure theres a fair amount of nudity too if thats your thing i wouldnt say theres much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isnt  arent respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it i supposebr br technically live feed isnt terribly impressive the blood looks a little too watery for my liking  entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening it to often looks like it was shot on a handheld camcorder  the choppy editing at least on the r rated version is at times an annoying mess shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in vancouver in canada the acting is poor sometimes i couldnt tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughingbr br live feed is not a film i would recommend anyone to rush out  buy or rent i didnt think much of it with its very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition  which goes nowhere poor acting  less than impressive gore at least in the r rated cut anyway watch either hostel films again or instead as they are superior
