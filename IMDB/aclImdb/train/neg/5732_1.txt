im all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sht how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me if you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it there was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake ill take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day my partner gave up after about 20 minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one i on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better no such luck i havent sen his other movie torched and i doubt if ill bother now
