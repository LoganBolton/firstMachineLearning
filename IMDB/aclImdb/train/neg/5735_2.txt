first of all this is a lowbudget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest and essentially thats all it isbr br plot there really is none its basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color texture etcbr br i believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awfulbr br there are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even brate movies deserve some opportunities blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it but this was simply awful i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against itbr br im all for brutality and shock but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience save your timemoney and chance something else you wont be disappointed
