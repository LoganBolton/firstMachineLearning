first of all the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes arent there enough browneyed actors out there jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves he was a fullblooded jew second of all what is it with old englishlanguage movies that are supposed to take place in nonenglishspeaking countries and everybody has english accents another example is david leans dr zhivago arent there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent the movie often is not true to the scriptures and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesuss claim to be the messiah in the bible when jesus is baptized by john a voice comes from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased matthew 317 mark 111 luke 322 in the movie john the baptist says this the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy as well for example in the bible the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god luke 12638 but in the movie we do not see or hear any angel  mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam and when marys mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her she doesnt hear or see anyone either also in the movie when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem he says you shall not see me here again not until you learn to cry blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord for i and my father are one and the same the correct line matthew 2339 and luke 1335is you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord period jesus never claimed to be god the movie cuts out a lot of important parts the sermon on the mount is very expurgated but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isnt even in the bible a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john it seems like the screenwriter instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind and between the scenes the movie has one gem though  during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son at matthew the tax collectors house i had tears streaming down my face it is the best movie ive seen about jesuss ministry but that isnt saying much because the others are just terrible jesus christ superstar is my favourite movie about jesuss last days the passion of the christ is way too graphic though i like how jesus of nazareth instead of just ending with jesuss death continues on and shows his resurrection
