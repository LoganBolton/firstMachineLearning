a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivorsbr br released in 1993 darkness garnered something of a cult following upon release its easy to see whyits loaded and i mean freaking loaded with gore and its energy and enthusiasm like that found in other nobudget cult horror flicks like the dead next door and the children of ravensback is actually rather infectiousbr br while that may be true thats sadly not enough to save it the film was shot on a super 8 so the image is grainy and dark making things very difficult to see it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet also grating is the soundtrack made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal seriously what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal while one isnt expecting oscar worthy performances the acting is still strictly amateur hour as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatenedbr br in the end im sure fans of nobudget gorefests will love this everyone else though will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs
