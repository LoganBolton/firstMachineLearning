br br i am a bigtime horrorscifi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very x5 low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos red zone cuba benjiand godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead braineating mob the whydidieverseethispieceofzombiedungblues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etcad infinitum infinity10
