when i borrowed this movie from a friend thankfully i did not buy it on the package which truly looked bad and ugly was printed the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager surprise is chased by some vampirezombiecreaturesbr br lighting sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holidayvideo on a ten year old vhssystem if not worse i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promotshirts looked kind of cool i dont want to dis filmstudents or splattermovies generally but ive seen braindead and ive seen a 20dollarbudget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap
