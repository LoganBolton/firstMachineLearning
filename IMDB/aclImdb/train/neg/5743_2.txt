yes i know im one of the few people longing to trample this movie into the dust of oblivionso let me me tell you why i feel this way in truthhad it been advertized as a zombie film or the likei might have enjoyed itbut right nowim totally speechlessbr br spoilerthough im not sure whats to spoil lets start with the first huge flaw if i did not know that the movie is called darkness  the vampire version and had i not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood i would not have seen the connection with vampires i mean fangless give me a breakbr br second bad point whats with the metal it appears that all young people but mainly those socalled vampires are into various kinds of metaljudging mainly by their shirts dont get me wrong ive been into the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years but nobody s going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in iron maiden of all bands tshirts running aroundpretending to be vampires pathetic is the only only word that i could use herebr br third weakness the actors wait a minute what actors you mean the directors wooden friends words would be a waste herebr br yes alright the movie is very gory but what difference does that make it would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the briliant director had not chosen to create an artificial vampire topic in this movie i wanted to see vampiresbut was treated to some stupid looking kids i would have loved to use my baseball bat on the filmmakers should simply have advertized the movie saying cheap bgrade horror with no plot but a lot of gore br br this movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism and it makes me sick
