i have to say i hated this movie i dont like to say that because gerard butler is in it about a half an hour of boring conversation sorry to all who actually care about the plot i started fastforwarding to gerrys scenes i really dont know the ending i was that bored with it if gerry wasnt in it i probably either done one of two things fell asleep or turned it off but gerry is the bright light of this movie as he is with most of his earlier movies if youre a fan of gerrys dont worry hes as adorable and precious as he always is but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot good luck because youll need it either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake br br 410and thats just because the casting director had the sense to put gerry in this movie even though they had no idea of how to spell his name
