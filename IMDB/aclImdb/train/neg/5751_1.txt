the film must have been shot in a daythere are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red pointereven the scenerys green light that blends with the actorsthe plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest inspirationat least as a thriller genre movieeverything that got to do with poe in the moviehas a shallow and childish approachthe film is full of clise and no thrillingif you want to watch a funny bmovie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it as i did but theres no way to take this film seriously
