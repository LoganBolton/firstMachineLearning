i dont usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to startbr br the acting on jeremy londons part was horrible i didnt think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start br br well at least i got good laughs i wouldnt waste my time if i were you
