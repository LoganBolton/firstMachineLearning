though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of bloodbr br there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing acting editing and scriptwritingbr br jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances ive ever seen  his descent into the maelstr√∂m of madness is achingly selfaware and clumsy oh look at him twitch oh look at him drink strong spirits oh look at him raise his brow and cock his head at a jaunty angle oh look at his unwashed greasy dark hair oh listen to his affectedly husky voice he must be a tortured artistwritergenius oh yes out comes the poetshirt  its another boy who thinks hes byron or poe oh for the love of did someone give this guy a manual on how to act good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere the defunct little plastic toyprize in a discontinued brand of bargainbin cereal okay that was a stupid line  but thats only because londons performance has melted my brain with its awfulnessbr br katherine heigl is cute and very briar rose but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film  she delivered her lines like she was being held up in fact her whole performance was very wooden her poses as stiff as her lines  who knows perhaps she was just reacting to and trying to neutralise jeremy londons flailing excesses but if thats the case she takes it too farbr br notable is arie verveen as poe  while his characters role is confused he delivers the best performance of the piece he quite simply looks right but its more than that  he has some sort of depth i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal twodimensional quality of the rest of the characters huh maybe its just because i like poe and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen  whatever he had an interest factor otherwise missingbr br the rest of the characters are a faceless blur  there are all the usual caricatures the perky blonde bestfriend whos a bit of a floozy the smitten local cop whos a bit of a dork the protective older man who perhaps has too much unfatherly interest in our heroine the scheming old witch etc etc yawn yawn br br as with the distinct lack of blood for a horror movie issue none of the themes that they mention and that londons character mentions  so scathingly  in his attack on poes writing are followed through on as another reviewer said  there was potential here murder incest  genuinely shocking stuff but instead they skirt away from the issues and cut away from the violence a raised candlestick swinging through the air  closing in on its victim  thencut to black this is fine in a noirish traditional horror indeed its expected and is fondly received when it happens  its a dear convention especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup  but in descendant it just comes across as clumsy or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller  the horror of palingenesisdelusionmadness  or a simple and fun slasher movie it tries to be both or neither something new and exciting but either way it fails dismally the only horror element of this entire movie is its epic dullnessbr br i think the editor if there was one at all must have been drunk when she chopped this thing up  there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes scenes that appeared to be out of order but that could have just been the poor script likewise the director  cinematographer  there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning but just ended up looking silly again fine in a noir but this was trying to be something elsebr br the whole thing perhaps may have been funny in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned  omg how did this get made if i had been in the mood for some trash bagging unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch with the lights down low with the express intention of scaring myself silly  this is a very poor film and im afraid i cant recommend it to people not even for laughsbr br please please dont waste your time or money on this  either borrow a real horrorthriller film or find yourself a copy of poes fantastical tales either way youll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish
