this should be a great film meryl streep and jack nicholson costarring as two newspaper writers mike nichols directing uh uh its dull dull dull pointless and predictable slow and unfocusedbr br its a cookie cutter boy meets girl boy marries girl boy has affair girl leaves boy story now theres an original concept after squirming through two hours was it only two it felt like sixi wasnt sure whether it was a comedy a romance a tragedy or a soap opera it was done in 1986 im sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade its not that its such a bad picture its just that its such an ungood one
