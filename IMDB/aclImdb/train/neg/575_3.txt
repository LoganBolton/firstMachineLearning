this movie isnt very good its boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just trods along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes but whenever she has one of them pinned she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesnt bite them no wonder this went straight to cablebr br final verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie youre a sucker if you waste your time on this
