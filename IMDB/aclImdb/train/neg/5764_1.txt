scary movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words it makes movies like malibus most wanted look like oscar material lets just say thatbr br the original scary movie was great fun one of the better 90s spoof movies coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with dont be a menace to south central whilst drinking your juice in the hood but what the hell happened after the tragedy that was scary movie 2 i thought the cast and crew change would help matters but its even worsebr br within 20mins id smiled twice not one laugh the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor the fact that at this point in writing the majority of people on this site have voted it 1010 has made me feel physically ill when theres great flicks like school of rock out which actually have jokes that are gasp funny anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examinedbr br no stars
