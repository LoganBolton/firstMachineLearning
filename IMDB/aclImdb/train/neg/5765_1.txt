scary movie 3 2003 was a bad idea to begin with the last film was a mediocre effort put it next to this load its a comedy classic whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots at least it was funny theres nothing funny about forced humor jokes pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool the humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles wholl laugh at anything when they catered to the junior high school crowd any sense of self respect was tossed out the window ring parodies are not funny i have watched them in comedies since 1998 theyre so dated michael jackson jokes are not cool either whats even worse is making fun of two broken down has been performers whose best days were neverbr br the death of american cinema has been a slow one films like this are the nails that are being pounded into its coffin whatever happened to real humor i havent laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time too many bad movies rot the brain you want proof go to your local mega chain video rental store and see whats on the shelves this movie is bad dont believe the hype i would rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever againbr br definitely not recommended unless you have a handful of brain cells
