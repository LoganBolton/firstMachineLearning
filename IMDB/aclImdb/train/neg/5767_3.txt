as said before the visual effects are stunning theyre breathtaking i personally use blender and graphics like that are not easy at all but thats all this movie is not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear for example in the first scene proog and emo are trying to run away from who knows what the conflict seems to be between man and nature here later when they enter the room of the bottomless pit proog explains that one step out of place and youre dead here theres a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature as the movie progresses its clear that a conflict exists between man and nature but suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when proog out of nowhere murders emo proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man he betrays us not only is this depressing but we dont care because the conflict between the characters thoughts and actions is not developed its not a story about someone through struggle emerging stronger its depressing and has not point because theres no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does in my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects however the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy theres no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending in conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point but the graphics are good
