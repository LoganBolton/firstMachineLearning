elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community and while it was a very interesting idea in concept in reality it has failed miserablybr br the film is beautifully rendered which is probably the only redeeming factor a huge problem with them however is the vast overruse of light bloom its horrible although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike qualitybr br one thing to note is the terrible voice acting while proogs voice actor is at least semicompetent emos voice actor is horrible i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero you cant afford to hire real voice actors to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voicebr br as a whole the movie doesnt really go anywhere to me it seems like its more of a look what we can do kind of movie instead of a real film the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areasbr br overall it may be worth a quick download from the official site but dont expect anything except pretty graphics
