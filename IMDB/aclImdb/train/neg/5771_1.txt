ill start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms filmmaker film or movie in connection with this but criminal and crime against humanity seem a bit harshbr br the writing patheticbr br the directing patheticbr br the acting patheticbr br the cinematography too inept for wordsbr br the technical skills used to assemble this atrocity none whatsoeverbr br this lump of waste could hardly be called cinema the majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than revenge quest no this is just a 10 car pileup caught on videobr br well skip the plot in this review because there are far too many holes to be covered at once lets just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie to call the acting onedimensional would be giving them credit what little there is is atrocious to begin with and made much worse by the terrible video and editingbr br the worst part of this atrocity though apart from the plot would have to be the effects or rather the disturbing lack thereof there are no blanks in the guns no flashpots and what few sound effects existed were either stock gun sounds or they were generated by mouth yeah you read that right the filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a shh sound for the elevator doors i guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic this is supposed to be set in the year 2031 after all that doesnt explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fistfight scenes howeverbr br if it wasnt bad enough that the sound quality is terrible he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera and it shows the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all the sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep and theyre just as clumsy picture this the bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey a lady starts to run in fear he raises his gun an uzi and shakes it we hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi the woman runs away from camera and suddenly a single blood pack only 1 explodes on her back looked like she was hit by a paintball and she falls flat on her facebr br bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequencebr br in another sequence one which almost but not quite makes the movie funny enough to watch takes place in a stairwell the bad guy chases the good guy and the lady hes protecting down the stairs shaking his plastic uzi all the way you may wish to duck there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the placebr br i supposed alan deherrera cant be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it if theres any justice theres bound to be some karma out there with his name on itbr br should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste and i would strongly advise against it be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from bladerunner and the am radio that doubles as a walkietalkie try not to focus too hard on the plot it will only hurt you more if you dobr br 0 stars of 10 and thats being generous
