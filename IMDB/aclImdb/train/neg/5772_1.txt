i just have to add in case anyone actually reads this and hasnt completely gotten the point yet these other reviewers arent joking around this really is the worst colour movie youre likely to ever see when the movie started i couldnt believe something like this actually made it out for the world to seebr br theyre not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie it really does like the director took the family hi8 camcorder before dv cameras and computer nonlinear editing no other equipment lights sound gear etc grabbed some decentlooking acting students and went out to shoot a movie no script just making it up as he went alongbr br when i watched it it was on my mono tv so i only have one channel of audio left of right speaker at first i thought id hooked it up wrong the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldnt hear the dialog they recorded the sound on different bloody channels i mean theres movies that can be funny to watch so bad theyre good kind of thing im not sure this is one of those i mean ill admit to being a bit of a budding film maker and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better you know but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made itbr br as bad as they were the actors are the only good thing about this i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 but alas no if you want to make a movie but its turning out crap throw in some gratuitous nudity worked for roger corman
