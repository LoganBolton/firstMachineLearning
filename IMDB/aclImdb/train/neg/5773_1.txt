another fine effort by americas most underrated filmmaker his knowledge on the subject of racism is staggering and impresses me on more than one level accusations that lee is really just a devious little racist a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits hollywoods affirmative action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter nonsense mere rightwing propaganda the very notion that lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in america in order to produce hatefilled antiwhite movies is simply false and maliciousbr br some of lees detractors even go so far as to suggest that gotb glorifies africanamericans while putting down other races obviously another falsehood disseminated by people who are against peaceful coexistence between different races in america and elsewherebr br my favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black republican and the others in the bus the views presented by that man are simply wrong  all across the board 100 untrue he lacks education unlike the brilliantly informed guys who quite deservedly throw him off the busbr br terrific performances and an intelligent script make for a viewing experience that has been rarely rivaled by any political movies made sincebr br i also want to point out the incessant lies that the millionman march had only 80000 people taking part in itbr br and now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital lettersbr br so what message does lee send here if someone doesnt agree with your political views you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus i thought the movie said get on the busbr br apparently mrlee is for bussegregation after all ie is no different than those kkk lunatics before him the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the democratic partys line of thinking so much for freeing the slavesbr br the endcredits this movie was entirely financed by black people and distributed and marketed by a major hollywood studio run by jews and whites whom farrakhan despises
