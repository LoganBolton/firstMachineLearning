this movie is a modest effort by spike lee he is capable of much more than this movieget on the bus while apparenly anti racist does nothing but berate whites and degrade the black status quo the plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to louis farrakhans million man march the bus has every type of person you could imaginegay muslim gangbanger and the uncle tomhe is thrown off the bus though there was one only white person on the bus he was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the busi hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own hipocracy and rienforcation of steryotypes this should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment you may think i am a racist for writing this but i mean well better luck next time spike
