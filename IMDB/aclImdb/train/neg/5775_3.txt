theyre showing this on some offnetwork its well crap while it is not as bad as the bmovies they show on the scifi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly substandard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where theyre wrapping things up before the credits  not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range theyre playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time its not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
