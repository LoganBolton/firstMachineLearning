alright so ive been dying to see this movie stoked about the whos who in horror land that are in the filmwell my friend rented this brought it over and we started watching it its supposed to be a comedyi did not smirk even once until the 40min markbr br does it have to do with the budget not at all in fact theres films out there that cost close to absolutely nothing and theyre amazing to me anyways also while watching this film i couldnt help but realize the similarities ie stealing to a low budget indie film titled actress apocalypse read my review about it it destroys this film btwbr br this filmit had potential it really did it had the star power stolen plot lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movieieactress apocalypseseriously this angers me the more and more i think aboutit really couldve been funny a lot a lot of the jokes fall flat the acting is alright for what it is but it dragged on wasnt funny and the plot was totally stolenbr br i give this a two because it wasnt sooo awful but thats the only reason
