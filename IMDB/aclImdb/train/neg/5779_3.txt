i saw this movie a few days ago what the hell was thatbr br i like movies with brian ohalloran they are funny and enjoyable when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great this one could be really good some parody for slashers or another gore movies but then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway but it wasntbr br my opinion if like movies they look little bit like documentary with little bit of comedy try some moores movies or alien autopsy they are really about something this one was empty br br and put a comedy to title no comment really bad joke
