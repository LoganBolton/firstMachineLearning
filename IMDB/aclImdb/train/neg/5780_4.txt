i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better dont get me wrong its not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to its potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian ohalloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more oftenthey are the reason this gets 4 stars from me if youre going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm itjust thinking out loud there
