when you look at this now and hear all the language in here its amazing this was rated pg but thats the 1970s rating system for you peter falk spews out the lords name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who rate thembr br the cast is a clue to how profane this film can be falk peter boyle allen garfield warren oates gena rowlands and paul sorvino arent exactly actors you wouldnt find in the sound of musicbr br i like heist movies and a lot of films by director william friedkin but this script doesnt deliver and it just has way too much of the sleazy 70s feel to it visually and audibly for those who loved falk in tvs columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films this is far from the only case
