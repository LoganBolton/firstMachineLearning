ok so mr agramas company which is involved in some dubious business with former italian pm silvio berlusconi produced a horrendous mishmash by a mr carl macekbr br what is this horrendous mishmash im talking about well macek took three entirely unrelated japanese scifi animated series namely macross southern cross and mospeada added tons of dialogue  believing firmly that the american audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence   edited the whole lot heavily for violent content added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell reba wests singing was  and still is  unbearable and a total outrage especially compared to mrs mari iijima and the result was an 85episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holesbr br of course the mecha were cool to look at especially those in the macross saga and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good but whatever was good about robotech was not the result of maceks work or the voice talents he recruited it was because of the toils and efforts of the uncredited  why would i be too bold to accuse hg of plagiarism here japanese creators those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to robotech now wish we had never been exposed to robotech the originals are so much better naturally and make a lot more sensebr br robotech however did something worthwhile it prompted legendary anime creator leiji matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of japanese anime creators intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalledfor reworkings that talentless people like carl macek produce
