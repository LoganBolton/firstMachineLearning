this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincingthe film doesnt seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route i never saw the first film but this one doesnt stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching
