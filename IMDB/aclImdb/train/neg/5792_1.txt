another made for tv piece of junk this is an insult of a war movie i use the word movie in its loosest possible form i thought telly savalass career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit birmingham video thats shown on tarrant on tv on a semi regular basis but then id forgot he was involved in this id tried to push it into my subconscious memory but cable tv brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me br br i like the bit laughs sarcastically in the film which claims to be a scene from liverpool in the forties but its blatantly a shot of zagreb cathedral in the late eighties also the steam train the commandos are training on shows the jz jugoslavia zeleznice or yugoslav state railways logos on the side of the locomotive quite clearly even though the makers have tried to black them out why not just film in the uk if thats where most of the film is set br br cheap rubbish and a waste of celluloid
