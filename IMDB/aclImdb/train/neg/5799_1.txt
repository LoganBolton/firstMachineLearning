i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the goodlooking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i reexamined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdbbr br the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good  then a linereading actor spoke oh dear  this actors reading sounded like some pimplefaced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldnt read the jacket english dialog dubbed if theyd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasnt going to get killed off but stay as the constant main fixture yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus 1999999 stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one
