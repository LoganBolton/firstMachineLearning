listening to the directors commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when theyre going through that i could write a bookscreenplayaward winning sitcom phase theres a germ of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to someone elses movie but it is totally buried under an underwritten badly executed and laughably unthoughtout scriptbr br the lines are dire and the performances are unengaging though again im inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required rather plonked the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little coaching these actors could have acquitted themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading manbr br as it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when in order to infect bon jovis character with vampire blood from his ailing cohunter he is given a transfusion she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own admittance accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition  so i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse but not a lotbr br frankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go its not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons
