as a horrormovie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or vedma as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it cant scary even a little kid it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking its bad in all points from the goofy plot i dont know why the russian producersdirector decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous moderndayamerica thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it doesnt thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors work all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didnt even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i dont really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in estonia and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it doesnt irritate me thats why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film  dont waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror id advise you to find a copy of viy or the spirit of evil its really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better
