whats in here  let me tell you its the presence of alec baldwin hes not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after so not to mention literally  the matter of steve mcqueen being at the same role in the original because i dont want to make that comparison in the first place im not a big fan or even a fan of kim basinger she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average  and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty  well if being a blond would make anyone captivating then ill dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible  and what is it with all the craziness over miss basingers legs  its surely insanity or bad tasting  as i dont see them both as not sexy only but ugly too  and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what  ive just watched this movie so im dead already  yet what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the mostÂ…and of course i mean jennifer tillynow were talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette marilyn monroe however much more healthier  i cant help it she was the only new and watchable thing in here  michael madsen as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys james woods is here to summarize the early events beside the pool so the trailer would be by his voice later  and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywoods stuff so do your thing take your cash and good luck as an actor in other movies  the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography so the main goods of it the action the thrill  are here and fairly wellmade though any echo for deep meanings about the kinds of betrayal as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so dont wait for it ok its all in all another remake without anything special except jennifer tillys spicy moments  so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldnt end my review saying that basinger or anyone here did better than this movie it would be an insult because frankly anything is better than this movie
