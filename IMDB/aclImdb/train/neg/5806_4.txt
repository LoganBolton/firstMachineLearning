nowhere near the original its quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story but the directing is very poor basinger is weak  without good directing baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen i watched it just out of curiosity being a huge fan of peckinpahs masterpiece and i got what i thought almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing i wasnt even disappointed i just dont know what they were trying to do this remake doesnt try to play with the original material its not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its erabr br it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photographbr br this is a complete waste of your time save yourself 2 hours or watch the original again
