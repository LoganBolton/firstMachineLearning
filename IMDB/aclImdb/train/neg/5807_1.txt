dont even bother with this movie its bad when judged on its own merits but when compared to the 1972 original which is a classic its down right awful and btw somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book this is silly movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from they are 2 completely different art forms as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does if you used this criteria for all movies then 2001 would suck and so would forest gump and silence of the lambs
