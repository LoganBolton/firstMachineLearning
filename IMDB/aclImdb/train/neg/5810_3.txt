spoilers throughout br br the gettaway is mostly an action movie and what action there is to shootouts chases dumpsters and much much more it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coysbr br this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didnt care for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry but the movie itself didnt do it for mebr br the gettaway became really tiresome really quickly the plot is overshadowed by one fightchase after another and as the violence keeps piling up bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in in fact by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning i dont think bassengers eye makeup moves once during the whole picturebr br this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen certainly not but it isnt very good and unless one is an action movie purist i cant see really enjoying this movie because theres just not a lot here the gettaway isnt terribly original either and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull it really could have been better i thinkbr br bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they dont have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives sometimes less is more after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale didnt enjoy this one to much
