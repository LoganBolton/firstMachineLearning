i have not seen this movie in ages but figured id comment on it anyway mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells the original the getaway was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1 a sam peckinpah movie 2 featured steve mcqueen ben johnson and slim pickens 3 was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of timebr br by comparison the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife kim basinger mcqueen and his then wife allie mcbride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over whos stupid idea it was to make this moviebr br lets just get it said and out of the way  alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the cooler king and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on baldwins part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role like someone else points out peckinpahs 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the actionadventure heist genre by contrast baldwin bassinger  company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone with only michael madsens and james woods slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real peoplebr br the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words one viewing was more than enough not just because it didnt have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made peckinpahs movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing theres no artistic urgency to its existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoybr br so i dont know this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actoractress which in itself isnt a really good thing id always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie  fall flat with something original this movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out and its revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since its release mr baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in hollywood thank god for team america for putting him in his placebr br 310
