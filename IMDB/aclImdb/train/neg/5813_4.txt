tierneys an authentic tough guy but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner just count the times tierneys incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts the old clich√© about it only happening in the movies applies here in spades then theres the guy playing the watchman who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy ruining the menacing mood in the process the static oneroom sets dont help either and neither does director feists obvious lack of feel for the material then add a final car chase missing both imagination and payoff and the results are pretty flat in fact the movie only picks up in the stationhouse scenes where hardbitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocentlooking gas station attendants too bad that tieneys career never really gelled i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy offscreen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another his icecold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his toughguy best anyway this project might have worked as a radio play but as a movie with a promising noir title its a disappointment
