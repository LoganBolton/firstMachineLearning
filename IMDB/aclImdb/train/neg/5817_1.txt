the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it the characters were stereotypical whitetrash the movies plot was stunted from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny regretfully that was the only funny thing in the movie ms jenkins would be better served if in the future she would refrain from using her lifestory to entertain people it was simply that bad the one positive aspect of this movie this has nothing to do with the lackofquality of the film is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker
