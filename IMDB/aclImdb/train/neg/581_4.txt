before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so muchbr br but this isnt half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply isnt scary apart from jons character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldnt care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire  drug addict woman the female vampire simply isnt scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasnt exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like thatbr br the story is basically the same as before vampire wants berziers cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master  the original vampire as in the first film you really dont care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy templebr br so there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally
