this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen im studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog so the language barrier wasnt an issue i must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie there is only one professional actor in the cast and im guessing no professional directors or writersbr br although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesnt merit such a poor rating this is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 73 to something more realistic perhaps 43 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true nonevent 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get backbr br the real shame is that i am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length however if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give lost in translation a 10 as well
