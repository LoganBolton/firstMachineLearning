as others have noted this should have been an excellent hammerstyle film and it seems to me that thats how most of the actors were instructed to play it but the screenplay is so leaden poorly paced and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them that its all too overblown and selfimportant this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr rock finally realizes what hes done the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer but he was a lousy director
