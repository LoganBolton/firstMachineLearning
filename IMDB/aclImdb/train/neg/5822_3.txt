renowned cinematographer freddie francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horrordrama film 19th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and experimented on but the stockpile of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more  and he prefers them fresher being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate sleazebags robert fallon and timothy broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of noncriminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the devils is laughably badbr br after the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of england during the 19th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they dont do it in an artful way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didnt help out his actors muchbr br jonathan pryce and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and broom respectively and are very bombastic but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but pryce and rea overact the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot  pryce in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth its also a humor riot to see twiggy in this film at all let alone playing an indemand street whore since she cant act to save her life though her song during the final credits isnt so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to ill take mee clothes off for a shillin as bad as those three actors are in this film julian sands takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laughoutloud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety  pick an emotion any emotion br br theres only one good thing about the doctor and the devils timothy daltons performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic sewage dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton
