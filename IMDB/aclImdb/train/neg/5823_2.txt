drawing restraint 9 is a kind of movie one either loves or hates fortunately or not i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with killing whales is bad propaganda aesthetically the movie could have been pleasing especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception i use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device where good and bad are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone probably its just me but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived even when its all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environmentbr br in my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification for the sake of stretching only in my opinion drawing restraint 9 couldve been easily fit into 75 minutes but has a torturous length of 2 and 14 hours yes there were interesting shots but there were not enough of these to leave 15minute gaps of nothingness without notice the movie has no standard scenario and theres no evolution of characters but neither it is a documentary its rather a kind of conceptual installation thats an unusual form for a movie but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here otoh i also believe that the director shouldve had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutesbr br and yes the music score mostly resembled whale sounds how surprisingbr br 210
