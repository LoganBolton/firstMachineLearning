i thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful it was slow pretentious and boring i almost fell asleep there are some decent songs but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out yaowwww while someone taps randomly on a wooden object that being said there are some pretty songs but its not worth seeing hte movie over go on itunes they have the album preview it and choose the good ones br br half the movie is some guy making tea well thats a slight exaggeration but youll see what i mean if you see it that being said dont see it
