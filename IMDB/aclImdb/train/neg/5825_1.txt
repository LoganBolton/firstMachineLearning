this has got to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen there were people leaving the theatre others were falling asleep ok it was a late night show this is a nosense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again i would love to watch the makingoff of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think theyre doing something interesting i wonder the soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album even if youre a fan of bjorks music stay home its the best thing to do the little tiny pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture god
