slow and nice images changed one another with sometimes annoying music you know bjork in background for the first 75 of the movie if you did not have enough sleep thats a good time br br but in the last 20 of the movie director decides to bring idea of rebirth reincarnation or else through sm images spiritual lovers are cutting each others bodies with knives for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery br br operator and director are great but weird br br did not enjoy it at all
