i watched this movie as a preview of a matthew barney art exhibit it certainly prepared me i almost skipped the exhibit and in retrospect probably should havebr br aside from the score being great bjork and the photography rich and colorful the content was mostly tedious and predictable gee i really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearldivers were up to the film was mostly a silly mixture of japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mockhuntharvest the film peaks with enough gratuitous shockart to turn your stomachbr br what was the point of the movie while others might argue that it is an antiwhaling piece one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling personally i think it was barneys attempt at flashing the audience with his anal fecal selfmutilation and cannibalistic fetishesbr br bottom line unless you really get off on barneys sense of art dont bother seeing this movie the message is obscure the pace slow and the cultural references pretentious if youre after shockart youll do better at one of the many undead movies or hunting down an old copy of hustler and taking in a fecalcartoon
