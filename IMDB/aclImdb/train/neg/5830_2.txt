drawing restraint 9 dir matthew barneybr br how do you know when youre in the middle of a pretentious art film is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film is it when bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudoasian ritual maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment or when youre about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a philip glass score in any case drawing restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies at 135 minutes it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot i would call the use of color stunning and the opening sequence interesting but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a discovery channel documentary that is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of pss christ but that will be coming up laterbr br actually the documentaryesquire portions were the best parts of it the surface plot is about a whaling ship and then there is a ritual about making whale fat then there are the guests in the form of bjork and matthew barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passedout head shaving think frat boy pranks nicotine patches and giant furry pita hats then there is mutual evisceration cannibalism and lets not forget the giant turdbr br matthew barney has written that this is about the relationship between selfimposed resistance and creativity thats almost like saying if you dont get it then youre not creative in your interpretation so sod off because im an artist oh wait thats the postmodern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was postmodern but its supposed to be modern art which is about the art itselfbr br so lets start this whole interpretation bit shall we the following lines are only 34 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the moviebr br the first halfhour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp obviously the ramp is symbolic of the need for selfelevation to whatever standards you hold dear and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom then on a whaling ship they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale obviously a crude element of foreshadowingbr br on the ship they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale and take out the fins portion they replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd these are supposed to be the states of the movie itself when its fat its entertaining but bad for you when it is the spinal column its the important parts of the movie or the backbone so to speak then the giant turd is the bowels of the movie or when the movie is crapbr br bjork and matthew barney the arrive on separate ships are put into strange humiliating outfits which arent even well made or symmetrical one suspects that they ran out of money and barney was trying to quit smoking so they put patches on his head they go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a japanese wise man who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it a crash or intersection if you will this inspires bjork and barney who are different on the outside to start cutting each others legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person they intersect oh did i forget to mention that this has been done in a robbie williams video then the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid venn diagram barney made it through 8th grade geometry obviously or maybe at least some social studiesbr br oh and did i forget bjorks eargouging iwanttokillher score at times it is hypnotic but at others you just want to assassinate herbr br art film is one thing but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people it becomes a selfdestructive joke when do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art dali and bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent andor entertaining than this piece of trash un chien andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hourbr br so can i recommend this only if you like dull high art films with lots of symbolism and flat imagerybr br d
