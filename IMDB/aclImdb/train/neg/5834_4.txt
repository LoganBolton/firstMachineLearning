i watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and house md tuccis character is brilliant but socially inept out of choice similar to lauries character house but without the acerbic wit that laurie brings to house meanwhile tuccis straight guy the emphatic doctor seger is not developed into a more interesting character like the fallible straight guys cuddy and wilson indira varmas character adrienne holland is too similar to jennifer morrisons doctor cameron to be a coincidencebr br someone at cbs obviously noticed the success of house md and told his staff to get him her a similar show hoping that mimicry would prove successful however copying a show like house demands the same high level balance of wit and suspense and tucci and company are just not up to the challengebr br i didnt know the show was canceled until i read the comments on imdb but it doesnt come as a surprise to me
