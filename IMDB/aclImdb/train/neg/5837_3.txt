i cant say i liked this movie very muchit has some amusing momentsbut it doesnt seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a dramait doesnt really work as eitherits too light in tone to be a dramaand the amusing moments are few and far betweenit also doesnt make a lot of sensethings seem to happen for no reasonand its also extremely convolutedi feel like they just made things up as they were goingif they had just taken a bit of time to explain thingsthis might have been a better moviei would say the ending was anti climatic but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to somethingwhich it didntit just sorts endsand thats thati didnt find it boringreallybut like i saidthere there just isnt any pointill give winter kills a reluctant and weak 310
