what a terrible filmbr br it starts well with the title sequence but thats about as good as it getsbr br the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isnt so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isnt even scary despite the atmospheric musicbr br it really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good filmbr br it isnt a good film its trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it one out of ten
