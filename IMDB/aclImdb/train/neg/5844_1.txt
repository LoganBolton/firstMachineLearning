this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen and i dont mean that in a good way we wanted to see a crappy horrorthriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store for once the film was everything wed expected and more or should i say lessbr br the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera the socalled special effects are created by putting red seethrough plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats and the script dont even get me started on the script and just when you thought it couldnt get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was oscarmaterial compared to the endingbr br take it from me this film is hilarious if youre into crappy horrorfilms but if you want a good film keep on looking this is not for you
