i enjoy quality crapness and this ranks up there with some of the finest the cg is out of this world or at least predates our world and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so goddamn awful and even the obligatory nude scene doesnt really have any baps out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i dont know who wasted more time me watching this or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers i can assure you it wont however on a brighter note i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it
