nell shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in back to gods country of the previous year and she failed miserably this time she does better although it seems pointless something new hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase theres a brief premise which sets up the hero coauthor and shipmans boyfriend to have to save the girl played by shipman then its nothing but an exciting implausible chase from there of course it plays out like an hourlong advertisement for a maxwell sedan but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous it doesnt seem that she learned much from the lastminute rescue films of dw griffith or its parodies by mack sennett and other comedians which shes imitatingbr br one point of interest is that shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the films story which has as its protagonist a writer shipman again although she doesnt do much else clever or humorous with it even though she attempts to again others had pioneered the writers joke in the intertitles like anita loos with wild and woolly or frances marion with a girls folly both 1917 at least shipman gives the impression that she doesnt take herself or the film seriouslyand neither do i something new despite its claim is hackneyed
