t rama rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times styles and fashions hes like stuck with the same oldfashioned filmmaking stylebr br actors are not bad not good either anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic rekha is good but then  shes always good and here shes nothing more than such she makes the best of what she is given but she always does that in conclusion nothing great at all raveena is ok which means ordinary not bad not good nothingbr br this film is melodramatic occasionally stupid maybe its a delayed film well even then it still would be below standard the script is terrible the film is overdone and the story goes nowhere it feels like a film made in the early 1990s but the script makes it look even older the style is like from the 1950sbr br dont recommend unless youre a big fan one of the starring actors
