the original movie man from snowy river is one of the best ive seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two sensesrich girlpoor boy and ability vs bloodline the sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as rambo meets the black stallion without the charm of the black stallion the young hero comes back from a 3year absence and suddenly hes superman on horseback in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel ive hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angrythey missed hardly a clich√© brazen audience manipulationdo studio heads think that all you have to do with a horseloving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy a mess of a movie
