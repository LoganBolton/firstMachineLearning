i saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when i was a sophomore in high school i took a date to see it i didnt get any needless to say because the film was so bad joan rivers career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap in fact unfunny isnt a severe enough term this film is antifunny you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen this isnt worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being sobaditsgood not even the gang at mst3k couldve made this worth watching the fact that billy crystals career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle
