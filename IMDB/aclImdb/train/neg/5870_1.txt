i didnt like this film at all first of alli dont know why but everyone here says that clémence poésys play is excellent which in my opinion is absolutely wrong she is not like natasha another appearance another character whats worse she is a very unexperienced actress and thats why she wasnt able to play this role she disfigured the heroine completely that was really disgusting to watch her play to my mind that would be much better to give this role to a russian actress because that would be much easier for her to understand the russian soul for a russian person unfortunately kutuzov looked like a drunk man who hasnt shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye thanks god in this film therere some actors whose play was awesome i suppose that alessio boni coped with his task very well i was pleasantly amazed he is one of the few people whos read the book which is very important for the play in addition i liked plays of our russian actors that was really wonderful to watch them the only thing i liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses my advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense the aim with which leo tolstoy wrote this masterpiece and maybe realize the whole idea of the book 1 from 10
