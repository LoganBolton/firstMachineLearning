i saw this for gary busey and fred williamson thinking they were buddy cops they are but busey is in the opening scene then doesnt show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie though every scene hes in is awesome especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobobr br whats incredible about this movie is the plot in the movie fred williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators at one point i think thats its busey but it turns out im only partly right busey is not the killer but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone why i dont know in no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks i guess
