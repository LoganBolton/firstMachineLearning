as the front cover says the hamlet of our time for our timebr br i had to study this filmed version of hamlet directly after watching keneth branaghs version and it was truly a disappointing experiencebr br this version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality one very very homosexual osric and an interesting interaction between hamlet and ophelia i think for the time 60s this was a very well done version of hamlet but cannot compare to branaghs complete versionbr br just a note i found the video at my local video store in australia and im actually looking for a keneth branagh dvd to buy if such a thing even exists if anyone knows of one please tell me
