this film differentiates itself from the runofthemill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic 50foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest ofteenage armpit hair unfortunately im not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and dont have pasta salad beforehand
