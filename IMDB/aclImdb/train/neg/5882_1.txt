not sure why this film was advertised as a wild quirky laugh filled comedy there is not much in this movie that will entertain nor amuse the moviegoer annette bening whose acting was touted as being oscar worthy comes off here as mannered with her performance seeming routine brian coxs character is confusing and irritating and the lead playing augusten  joseph cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role the best thing about the film is evan rachel wood but she is not enough to endorse this boring unsavory filmbr br the film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason i found some of the scenes distasteful the scene with brian cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in you and me and everyone we know and the squid and the whale some embarrassing and most of them unsettling i found the whole experience a waste of time dont you waste your time
