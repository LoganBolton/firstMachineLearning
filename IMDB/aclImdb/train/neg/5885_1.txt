to make up a moviegoing audience  im certainly stunned by the number of positive comments this wretched film has garnered here i cant credit it cant help but be suspicious for that matter of back alley payoffs to critics who are touting annette bening for an oscar the hole in the kitchen ceiling might be more appropriately attributed to her scenery chewing shes a wonderful actress but this is an unfortunately unbalanced performance lacking that essential quality film actors must master of catching the cadence of the screenplay and maintaining it for the duration of the disjointed madness that is a film shootbr br i dont really want to blame miss bening or most of the other performers well gwyneth paltrow has no excuse for her muzzy work however because this is a horrendous adaptation a classic case of mistranslation i am prepared to assume i havent read the book and dont think i will after this the script launches us into the middlemuddle of unaccountable behaviour and extreme emotional angst spewing from mystifying characters who have developed relationships neither with us nor each other it quickly becomes a grotesquely excessive tsunamilike assault that sullies characters and audience alike and left me like a survivor shaking my head at the detritus left at the end of each repetitive episode shock and awe would describe my reaction to frantic bipolar mood swings between ranting and ohsoquiet sensitivity the latter telegraphed by one of the most irritating manipulative droning soundtracks ive heard  that is when all this isnt being set to ludicrously incongruous toons  period stuff ya know but chosen with an astounding disregard for the tone of the scenesbr br how this fine cast got mixed up in this i dont know  i cant believe they saw the screenplay before signing they certainly apply their skills with commitment  i felt so sorry for the wonderful jill clayburgh saddled with a cartoon bag lady costume and wig trying vainly to wrench something of significance from sketchy and clich√©d dialogue in contrast somehow alec baldwin rises above the material to deliver a consistent nuanced real performance can somebody give this man a lead role of substance please and how about rachel evan wood  or joseph fiennes youd think the industry could make better use of him and without appearing as hirsute as elliot gould in mash br br my vote a standup turd all right but no link with heaven
