i would have left the movie halfway through if i hadnt been with people who liked it the movie is based on real incidents but its so over the top it didnt feel real at all i have some psychological background hang out with a lot of psychotherapists and have known seriously crazy people so its not that i think people like this dont exist but in the film the only characters who seemed consistently human were augustens father alec baldwin and the young augusten jack kaedin although evan rachel wood was an intriguing diversion  very sexy with a wicked sense of fun there were a few amusing moments but the overall tone of the movie was grim bizarre and nasty what a waste of an outstanding cast as i watched them go through their turns i just felt like i was watching an acting class this was brought home during the credits when a couple of people were shown just sitting there not acting not talking those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours
