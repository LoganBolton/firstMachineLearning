first of all i firmly believe that norwegian movies are continually getting better from the tedious emotional films of the 70s and 80s movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour imagine actual comedies were made movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny as opposed to long dark depressing and boringbr br during the 90s and 00s several really great movies were made by a new generation of filmmakers movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money it became the normbr br then came unitedbr br minor spoilers its just simply not funny not once not ever but the thing is we think its funny because were used to norwegian movies to be funny especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians but they neither say nor do anything funny wheres the humor show me the humor is it the awkward clerk played by harald eia is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach is it the commentaries by arne scheie the movie is just not funnybr br but thats not my main rant about united that namely is the predictability and it is here i fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since i have seen this in many other movies as well all the time you just know its going to end well all characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end theres absolutely no room for surprises at allbr br all in all i can say that i sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie it was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making againbr br rating 16
