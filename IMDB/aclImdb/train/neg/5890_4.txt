this romantic comedy isnt too bad there are some funny things happening here and there and there are some rather memorable characters in itbr br the acting however is amateurish with the exception of the banker while some scenes are great fun others are simply embarrassing in particular i found the romantic part of the story poor br br all in all i guess its worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies its not really a bad movie and the ending did feel quite good just dont expect anything out of the ordinary fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill
