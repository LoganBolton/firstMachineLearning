how many centuries will pass until the japaneseasian horror films abandon the longhaired ghostwoman shtick admittedly theyve managed to rip off ringu a million times and often it worked well  which just goes to show that originality isnt that much of a requirement in the horror genre or that im very uncritical and easy to please however this time around i found myself a little restless somewhat bored its not a bad film but its at least halfanhour longer than it should be with its absurd 110 minutes length compared to many other japanese horror films omc lacks atmosphere and excitement plus the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all as for the ringtone miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing even though it was played a dozen times i cant even remember it  thats how scary it was speaking of miike for him this is something of a commercial venture so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the bijita q or audition kind theyre wasting their time
