one missed call another asian horror based on the cell phone i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called pon one missed call was just as boring as that one maybe phones just arent scary or something but this move was dull and drab no tension or thrills for me and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts and felt too long didnt keep my attention it seems phones are hard to make frightening its kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie and it is ridiculous to compare this with the ring it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i havent seen any that measure up in the least to horror directors  take the phone off the hook as a horror device
