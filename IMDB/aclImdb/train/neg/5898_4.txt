basically take the concept of every asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie the story goes like this a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths theres some s going on with ghosts which if youve seen any asian ghost movie isnt scary by now this movie was quite upsetting because its very clichéd its the same bullcrap different moviebr br the acting was pretty good unfortunately the actors are put into a very ringesquire situation so its nothing we havent seen in the past the two lead acts did a solid job thoughbr br as far as gore theres not much going on we get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off i dont know how else to explain that but it was cut away so you dont see anything except the final result you see some blood at times including decapitated arms and a zombie that looked really cool i might add but this movie isnt too bloodybr br the scares in the movie are few and spread out and its really not that scary youll get some creepy images at times but its not enough for me to consider scary its nothing different from ringu juon or dark water and none of those scared me either thats really the downfall of this and most asian horror movies is that if it doesnt deliver the scares then its just not that goodbr br as far as directing takashi miike still did a pretty good job he seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style hes become famous for a lot of images were a lot like miike including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses and the last 15  20 minutes seemed far more miike then the rest of the movie still the movie is flawed by its unoriginalitybr br i would recommend this only to people who are huge on asian horror movies even if you are i can recommend much better or big miike fans warning to those who want to get into miike this is not his best workbr br im giving it a 4 because its just mediocre perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher ratingbr br also id like to b about asian horror movies real quick how come if its an asian horror movie its automatically suppose to be good over here us a lot of these movies are the equivalent in japan to what scream urban legends and i know what you did last summer were over here in the 90s if youve seen one youve seen them all and a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesnt deliver the scares they set out to do then theyre just not that good and nothing would change that more asian horror films need to be more like audition and a tale of two sisters two movies that if they dont frighten or scare you at least they have great stories acting direction cinematography and much more to back them up two movies that arent just great horror movies but great movies in general more asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the cliché a ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phonevideo tapehouseelectric appliancewater pipesgoogle search enginevibratorgroceriesetc
