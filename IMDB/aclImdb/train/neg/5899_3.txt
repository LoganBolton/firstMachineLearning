by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work i sat through this flick tonight i figured if its half as good as ringu as i assumed from these comments it might be than it will be worth my timebr br no such luckbr br im all for finding the next great director or writer but i dont think miike is the one i dont have an nyu masters of fine arts but i do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie doesbr br this films pacing had me shaking my head some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end eyes wide and mouth agape a famous director once made the claim and im paraphrasing a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll kou is not a good enough actress to make that work she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember and she isnt the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this nonperformance the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the timebr br i like asian cinema hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years korean horror like phone and koma ang lees work some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting as well as others chakushin ari i could have done without
