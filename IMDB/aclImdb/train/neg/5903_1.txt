i live in salt lake city and im not a mormon so why did i rent this movie well because i live in utah and thought itd be nice to see locations i know in a film i really knew going into it that i wasnt going to get the inside jokes so i wasnt surprised when i sat with the deer in the headlights stare what i was surprised at was the antnon mormon actions that were placed in this filmbr br i know its a mormon film catered to the members of the lds church but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isnt of their faith every non mormon which wasnt many drank smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude whybr br that really ticked me off about this film they made the mormons so pure yet the rest of the state of utah i guess is filled with punk psychos just because they dont follow the scriptures of the lds churchbr br i can understand having the plots revolve around all lds members but youd think salt lake city was 100 mormon which isnt even close to being the truth and as i said the non mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks pleasebr br i guess i just dont get it because i dont belong to their faith and i guess i never will
