with the runaway success of gods army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasnt at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the singles ward however is notbr br telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the singles ward is in many ways very similar to the 80s comedy ferris buellers day off however the similarities end there while ferris bueller was funny original and wellacted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the singles ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes youve probably heard a million times before the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is amaturish at bestbr br in addition if youre not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you wont get hardly anything at all whereas gods army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it its just not that funny
