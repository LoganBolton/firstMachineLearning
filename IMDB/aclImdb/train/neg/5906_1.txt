this movie was terrible the plot sucked the acting was bad the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out i wish i had the time i spent watching this movie back the balloon scene was stupid the mormon jokes are really old the soundtrack sucked i saw no chemistry between the two leads its full of stereotypes stupid local celeb cameosmost noted was del im going to drive as fast as i want to computer idiot what is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up this movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream lds beliefs into hollywood ie the rm church ball etc etc i would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall you will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show
