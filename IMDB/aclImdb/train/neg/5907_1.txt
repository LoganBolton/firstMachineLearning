yeah that about sums it up this movie was horrifying two minutes in i wanted to gouge my eyes out this has been praised as an innovative lds comedy but its not even good for members of that church i dont think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low qualitybr br first of all you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie it seems as if the horribly drab glib trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent at least semicoherent thought then theres the acting which is dismal from everybody involved even the cameos fail to liven anything upbr br and lets not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue appallingly hideous gags and a lot of mormon injokes that anyone in their right mind lds or not should consider purely stupid this has to be one of the worst films ive ever seen
