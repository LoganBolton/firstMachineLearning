the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the directors express intention in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china however i found the combination of the glacially slow plot and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating particularly to a western audience at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart as they were filmed from such a distance two hours in and i was totally past caring as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema i couldnt engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into it begs the question if i disliked it who on earth would like it give me zhang yimou give me chen kaige give me the work of just about any other chinese director ive ever seen this sorry effort just doesnt measure up at all id be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark
