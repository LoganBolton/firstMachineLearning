this movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society therefore can thieves rapists and murderers the killer of this movie carl panzram james woods is all three and worse be held fully accountable for their deeds an interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way and this is where killer a journal of murder falls very short although the film tries to put panzrams behaviour into perspective with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing the viewer never gets the idea that panzram is a victim rather than a culprit sure the system is corrupt with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of leavenworth prison where most of the movie takes place most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot but why on earth does new prison guard henry lesser robert sean leonard take such pity on panzram even after having read his gruesome diaries the movie offers some explanation lesser witnesses panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard and is impressed by panzrams intelligence though it isnt clear why exactly lesser thinks this man is so smart surely this isnt enough to sympathize with a hostile man like panzram even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality towards lesser panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in panzrams diaries does this man lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him perhaps it is lesser who is a product of modern society judging on appearance rather than substancebr br i can advise monster starring charlize theron and christina ricci as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scopebr br btw killer looks as though shot for tv not so good
