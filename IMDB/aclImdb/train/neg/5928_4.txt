i just dont get some of the big premises of this episode  that miranda is so remarkable and that theres anything so ugly it would make you insane someone here made the remark that maybe its the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness miranda is just a jerk the episode is slow inconsistent and way too talky i also dont quite understand why kolos is an ambassador  why doesnt the federation just leave the damn medusans be theres one part i do like when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience overall i love tos and even at its lamest ill always tune in this episode though  mmm i wouldnt purchase it except for a used copy under 3
