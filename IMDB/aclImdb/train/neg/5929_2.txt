the people who are praising this film are the real disappointments  i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good  out of this as his life savings were embezzled away by a manager a couple of years ago and hes over 70 now but this film is simply terrible at the beginning leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of leonards songs it is so bloody precious with its endless closeups of over emoting singers cohens interview is all done in lofi video closeups and i so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body i couldnt care less about the comments of the performers especially those overblown ego boys edge and bono none of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as leonards own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all heed them this would be an acceptable pbs special maybe for a one time showing but i will even hesitate at getting a dvd of this when the film finally shows leonard semiperforming tower of song its ruined by bono taking a verse even the occasional good performances antony rufus first number marthas the traitor are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla forget this one and go buy leonards most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him
