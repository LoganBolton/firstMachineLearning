heybr br if your going to make a documentary about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers some of them questionable talk about themselves puleezesounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high  who cares about you what about leonard guess what people if you do something worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you i found particularly insulting the parading of u2s members as if that would add credibility to this movie  not leonard doesnt need bono or the edge talking about his spirituality what would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film gee what a concept i will give props to rufus wainwright and jarvis cocker for their covers of cohen tunes  the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearablebr br cohen fans dont say i didnt warn you
