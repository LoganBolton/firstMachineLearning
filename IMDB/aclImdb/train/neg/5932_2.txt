what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself unlike ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater or on the couch is reliving the great songs themselves here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture cohens slow jazzy style more often the covers are badly sung folk versions yuckbr br the interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work never singing like letters poems etc the movie really didnt capture much about the artists life story either or about his development through the years a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan
