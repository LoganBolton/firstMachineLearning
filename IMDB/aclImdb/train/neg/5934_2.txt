i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohens greatest fans he does however feature as an important poet  musician in my literary  musical heritage by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonards reflections on his own life and career warming and humble br br unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didnt converse the nuances of leonards musical  literary manner nick cave jarvis cocker  beth orton were the exceptions even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songsbr br what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him a lot is said in this respect but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge they view leonard as a special icon but cant translate their exact value of leonard cohen the collaboration with u2 is a farce the entire live registration looks like a rushed job and just as in the whole film only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own partbr br the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project the use of effects such as echo slowmotion or flashed images are ill placed some of the camerawork is dismal part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film perhaps a reference to his once use of lsdbr br some unintentional humor  at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre initially he cant recall the genres name until eventually he says it was punk the punksters really picked up on his music the next scene in the film is a live cover of i cant forget br br and i cant forget i cant forget i cant forget but i dont remember who
