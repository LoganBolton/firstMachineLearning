the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohens intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his allround humanity laughter and tears in onebr br to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream im a singer is a true pain its the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennons imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original if there is a form of art that doesnt need embellishments its cohens art embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless makeup of sex for salebr br in this cohens tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show its cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughters he could have become very tenderhearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didnt stay in the familybr br fortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing homebr br a sad show really and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do
