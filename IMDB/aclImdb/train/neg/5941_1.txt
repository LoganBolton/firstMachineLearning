as a fan of notorious big i was looking forward to this movie i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie jamal woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious big a lot of the story follows notorious bigs real son christopher jordan wallace as notorious big as a kid unfortunately he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean puffy combs in a nutshell no one is convincing enough to play their roles here the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing it was boring and did not give any information about notorious big that fans and nonfans alike did not already know i was especially disappointed with angela bassett a very good actress wasted here as voletta wallace the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious big fans will spend tons of money on it i am unfortunate to say that that happened its nowhere close to a good movie i was expecting so much out of it but unfortunately i didnt get anything i wanted from this i think you should definitely skip this one
