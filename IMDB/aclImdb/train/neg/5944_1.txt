not exactly my genre this straighttodvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers im relatively open minded and quite a fan of eamonn walker so i sat back ready to enjoy myselfbr br blood and bone is the story of isiah bone an excon who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses blah blah blahbr br what a tedious film i understand that films like this dont rely hugely on plot but do they have to stuff in such a silly predictable and entirely stupid storyline it may not be important but by golly gum does it annoy me better no plot and pure action than a cl√≠cheridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel it is the cinematic equivalent of a thinskinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards i should probably at this point mention what is of course the films drawing point the fighting even in itself the fighting is rather poor bone manages to take out well established toughman street fighters in single punches a large oaf or two is the filmmakers laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy even this is repetitive and stupid arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time againbr br a run of the mill filmbynumbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status doing absolutely nothing new and everything weve seen time and time again and not even particularly well
