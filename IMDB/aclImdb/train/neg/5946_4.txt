there is absolutely no plot in this movie no character developmentno climaxnothing but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good so there you goas a movie overall is pretty bad but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie do not expect nothing more that just thatdecent acting and a not so bad directiona couple of cameos from kimbo and caranoi was looking to see carano a little bit more in this movieshe is a good fighter and a really hot girl white is a great martial artist and a decent actor i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his artimagine a film with white and jaa togetherthat would be awesome
