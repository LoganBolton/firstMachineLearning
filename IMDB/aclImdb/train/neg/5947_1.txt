this is one of the most hateful and cruel movies ive seen in a long time sadly i was duped into sticking with it since donald sutherlands presence misleadingly gave it some credibility thats the last time thatll happenbr br lesley ann warrens character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come there were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask where is the justicebr br why is latenight cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered this film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process all it ends up doing is turning the viewers stomach with its sickness and insulting the viewers intelligencebr br the cast is misleadingly good my guess is that they bagged sutherland first and used him to lure the others like lemmings into thisbr br im kicking myself for wasting time giving this piece of garbage a chance
