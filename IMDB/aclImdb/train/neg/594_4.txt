i just rented creep and was not at all impressed i didnt feel anything in this film i felt sick because the gore alone was shockingbr br i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film havent we seen this all before i didnt like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage i felt bad for him but then again i couldnt think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep so many questions need to be answeredbr br someone mentioned references to the ps2 game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguelybr br not a bad film not a good one judge for yourself
