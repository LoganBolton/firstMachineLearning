my first question after seeing this film was why is the title liam if the intent was to tell a story from the boys perspective it was not carried out well of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boys scenes but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute powerless position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depthbr br melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters exaggerated emotions and language simplistic morality and conflict liam fits this definition to a t the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the wellfed priest squeezing money from parishioners a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome whats morethe jewish characters are money lenders and factory ownersbr br much of the film was predictablewho didnt think that wed see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her no daughter of mine will scrub another womans toilet im a fan of british realism if its done well in my opinion liam is notbr br
