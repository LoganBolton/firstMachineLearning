you do realize that youve been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an island but youd think that after watching unkempt stinkladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interestingbr br and im not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable its just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned makeshift biodome sipping frosty mochcinnos with moxybr br whats the appeal here i dont care about these people or their meandering lives i just dont get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking paydirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankensteinstyled cancerstick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of fullblown schizophrenia kicks into gear now thats entertainment
