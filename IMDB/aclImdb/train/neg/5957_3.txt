insignificant and lowbrained haha 80s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind the special effects are tacky the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs the brain takes place in a typical quietamerican town setting where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the coolkid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet it is here that a tvguru named dr blake and his adorable petbrain begin their quest for nationwide mind controlling under the label of independent thinkers a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill how cool is that now its up to the meadowvale teenrebel to save the world the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr blake and his monstrous brain actually come from there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but thats about it meh who needs a background in a movie like this really theres not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil brain looks like an oversized sockpuppet the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made bloody birthday guilty pleasure of mine and plague both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in reanimator a girl named christine kossak provides the nudityfactor and shes obviously a great talent she has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which this is her masterpiece in her debut she was credited as runaway model and in 3 men and a baby her character is referred to as one of jacks girls i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress
