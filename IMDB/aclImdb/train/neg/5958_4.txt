in the small american town of meadowvale dr anthony blake david gale the imdb listing for this character is wrong its definitely dr blake not dr blakely is the director and founder of the famed psychological research institute and also hosts a local tv programme called independent thinkers he uses this tv show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence dr blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses its spinal cord as a tail thingy usually the brain is just sitting in a tank eats mice and the odd bad actor each time it eats someone it gets much bigger meanwhile at the local highschool gifted but troublesome teenager jim majelewski tom bresnahan has been caught putting sodium down the toilets jim is sent to dr blake at the pri for help with his attitude and behavioural problems while there dr blake hooks jim up to well something im not actually sure what this whatever it is is attached to the brain at first jim is able to resist the brains mind control the brain feels that jim is a threat to itself and its plans once out of the pri jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend janet cynthia preston as cyndy preston but is handed back to dr blakes assistant verna george buza soon after by officer marks harry booker the brain wants to kill jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding its mind control techniques and with independent thinkers going national the brain doesnt want anything or anyone to stop its evil plan for world domination jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain before it takes over the worldbr br directed by ed hunt who calls himself edward hunt here the brain wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be dont get me wrong as it certainly isnt great either the script by barry pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by tv storyline it moves along at a fair pace and isnt too boring no explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all its just there and thats it we have to accept it the story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element theres the tv mind control the brain itself jim being hunted by the police  his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding dr blake that isnt explained at all production wise this film looks cheap and probably was cheap the acting isnt great but ive seen worse and what is david gale doing in this in fact this role is similar to gales role in reanimator 1985 even down to his characters deaths in both films the brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big each stage is just made of rubber it doesnt look particularly good and isnt scary or creepy just cheap theres no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and youll miss it decapitation the nudity is provided by dr blakes assistant vivian christine kossak as christine kossack before she gets eaten the brain had a certain entertainment value for me but i would think most people would dislike it maybe worth a watch if you can see it on tv for free
