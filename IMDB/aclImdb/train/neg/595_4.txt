creep  your journey terminates here some very graphic scenes andwell yeah thats about all for this filmbr br no real plot no storyline no likable characters well characters isnt correct considering you dont have a clue who anyone really is i mean they are being chased by some weird looking thing in the sewers who is this thing why is he there thats quite scary i guess but do i really care no i dont why dont i because i dont have a clue who these people are and i dont know if i should want them to live or die its one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you which it rarely doesbr br this film lacks any meaning any purpose it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up it jumps right into the action basically some women and her friends get locked in the london underground get chased by a weird creature then they eventually escape from itbr br creep has its moments which make you jump the art is good the location is excellent and the sounds are ok but that isnt what makes a decent horror film so unfortunately all that goes to wastebr br its nothing new another predictable modern horror where kate the lead character consistently does the stupid hey i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation but oooh no im going to do the total opposite because im a dumb blond thing i wish they wouldnt do that its done so many times its boring and gets predictable in fact im pretty annoyed the silly woman didnt get stabbed by the erm grey alienlooking creaturebr br your journey terminates here is the films tag line well creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film if youve had a few beers got a couple of mates back at yoursthen sure watch it by all means but if you want something original and clever avoid
