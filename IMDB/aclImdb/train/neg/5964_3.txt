the version of this film i saw was titled horror rises from the tomb the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like hes playing abanazer in a church hall panto he rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant i think hes a descendant as hes also played by naschyreturns to his ancestral home and reunites the magicians head and body which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him in an attempt to stop him er rising from the tombbr br obviously once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die like all good magicians abanazer here has a lovely assistant this ones played by another spanish horror great the beautiful helga line like practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off theres a lot of nudity in this film and not just female  we even get to see naschys paunchy body which isnt a pretty sight i can tell you most of the films sex angle is laughably gratuitous theres one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde theyve possessedbr br its also pretty gory in places  notably a herschell gordon lewisesquire moment where line plunges her hands into a mans chest to remove his heartbr br the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end theyre quickly scared off by a fire though and dont bother coming back which is a shame the scene where the zombies rise however is the films most ludicrously inept moment it all happens in long shot and we havent really got a clue whats happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance there are several rubbish moments like this thanks largely to poor editing when a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of naschys head theres a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoeverbr br all in all not a great horror film but entertaining enough of course the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces for all i know the original spanish version could be a masterpiece
