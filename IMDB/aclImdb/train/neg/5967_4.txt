just think it cost a total of 250000 to make clerks how the hell did they spend 45 million to make this glorified music video a practically unknown cast two or three sets no special effects that i could see i know it must have been spent on that expertly crafted economical tension filled screenplay shoot that bar set must have cost a bundle anyway i guess jerry bruckheimer wouldnt be caught dead producing anything for less im just surprised he didnt blow up anythingbr br anyway it wasnt an awful film i guess the female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was ok imo it just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for 5 million without any loss to the production and 6 more 5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well
