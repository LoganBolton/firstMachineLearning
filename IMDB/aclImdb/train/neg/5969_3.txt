spoiler do not read this if you think about watching that movie although it would be a waste of time by the way the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anywaybr br if you are wondering whether to see coyote ugly or not dont its not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs  dvd a typical chickfeelgoodflick one could say the plot itself is as shallow as it can be a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream the young goodlooking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail such as the tragic accident of the father the difficulties of violets relationship with her boyfriend and so on mcnally director tries to arouse the audiences pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of jerseys fear of singing in front of an audience the only good and quite funny thing about coyote ugly is john goodman who represents the small ray of hope of this moviebr br i was very astonished that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie first gone in 60 seconds and now this what happened to great movies like the rock and con air that was true bruckheimer stuffbr br if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening you should better go and see charlies angels its much more funny entertaining and selfironic instead of this flickbr br two thumbs down 3 out of 10
