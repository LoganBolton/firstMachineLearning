basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970s classic kitsch horror death line which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground stationbr br making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot  dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train  originality is not this films strong pointbr br indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the subgollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot devicebr br franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film outacted by a small dog and a pack of tame ratsbr br if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play spot the tube location them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meatbr br if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains
