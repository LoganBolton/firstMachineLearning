wow i dont even really remember that much about this movie except that it stunkbr br the plots basically a girls parents neglect her so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad am i the only one disturbed by that then this weirdo pokemon kidnaps ashs mom to pretend to be the girls i dont care if he was trying to make the girl happy thats just grossbr br there was no real plot the girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way she played with unowns was the daughter of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her dadbr br thats pretty much all i can remember but i think you can take it as a hint and not see it or if you do see it dont expect much 1 out of 10br br seriously if you want a pokemon movie rent pokemon the first movie
