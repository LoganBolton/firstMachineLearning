i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of gerry andersens marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great actionadventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target itbr br i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more actionadventure and the goal of the original series saving people in troublebr br instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the breakout part was lady penelope and parker i didnt care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the showbr br i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the hightech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgetsbr br but then im just a big kid
