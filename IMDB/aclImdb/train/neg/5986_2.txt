to say that thunderbirds is a horrid forced inyourface ugly looking nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldnt be saying enough there are only two reasons i can think of why youd watch this film 1 youve seen thunderbirds when you were young like i did and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up or 2 youre seeing it with someone under ten years oldbr br thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it from the off thunderbirds is wrong wrong wrong the whole moral message and goal is set up in an excruciating way jeff tracy a new low for bill paxton tells his youngest son alan hes not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy islands bowels to fire up thunderbird one the whole film is then a series of events and missfires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird fivebr br the film relies on kid actors to carry the film a 16 year old alan tracy corbet a 16 year old tin tin hudgens and a 14 year old fermat fulton who is brains son to say that watching the adventures they get up to is painful is an understatement frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil hood kingsley in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film it only differs when everyones in a different location also the whole mind control thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood  forced and incidentalbr br i know that most films for kids these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds its done in a way that fetishises lady penelope sophia myles plays penelope and i think its no coincidence shes a little older than the rest of the kids  at 24 years old its almost too good to be true her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push we see her in the bath bubbles up to her neck watching tv in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet bare and bubble covered foot frequent shots of her massive bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman twinned with this her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh dominant english accent sounding like a commanding mistress well she is lady penelope after all  and youd better make sure call her that the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids wont notice but it sure as hell is therebr br the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre the characters that are his bodyguards a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot are we supposed to be laughing at this what about the fight scenes poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises its utterly utterly laughablebr br the list goes on the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place news bulletin sponsored by ford the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip  its infuriating the fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the freezing thames against the current rescue a downed monorail monorail over the thames get back to the hatch and thus save the day all the time holding her breath it is absolute bull and the makers know it  i dont even know if a 10 year old would swallow itbr br in short avoid avoid avoid thunderbirds is infuriating unfunny poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car  everything that could go wrong did go wrong
