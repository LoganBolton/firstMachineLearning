i still havent gotten to see all of this its running on cable right now and i seem to keep coming in on the middle of it my main reason for being interested in it is that im a bill paxton fan hes a pretty good actor and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his careerbr br the other thing is that while never really a fan of the old series i kinda liked thunderbirds for the ships and effect work derek meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies and his designs for the international rescue craft are wonderful the current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screenbr br butbr br this is one lame story the kids are asked to drive it and while they do an okay job its hard to suspend your disbelief especially when you have brains eightyearold son flying t2 an enormous multiton transport with all the aerodynamics of a buick everywhere you look you see a ford logo product placement is way over the top here and its annoying ben kingsley does an good job as the hood but he can only do so much with a onedimensional role if you can accept the film on its very slim merits thunderbirds is a fun enjoyable ride just dont look too closely at the machinery that drives itbr br addendum i finally got to see all of this and its worse than i thought the acting is fairly uniformly poor and while the effects are fairly good the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier the overdone product placement for ford is annoying and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves as with the avengers if you ignore the source material its bearable but not very watch the original show and youll see what i meanbr br and a word of advice to jon frakes take a refresher course at the directors guild you can do better than this old friendbr br another footnotebr br i saw this again last night on telemundo dubbed in spanish with cheesy comedy sound effects and yes i came in roughly in the middle with ben ron and sophia in their fight scene on tracy island br br i didnt think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse but it was it was embarrassingly bad br br if this had been done straight no kidstotherescue no tongueincheek jokes it might have worked as it is its just another beloved childhood joy thats been ruined
