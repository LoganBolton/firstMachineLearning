ba ba ba boring this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis aka general hospitals laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie the music dramatically goes up and down like its a major dramatic story even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie at least with battlefield earth its so bad its funny but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep
