the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady corbet says youve blossomed near the end the film i practically died im still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there was it supposed to create romance because it nearly made me sick br br the rest of the script was almost as badbr br ive never liked the original thunderbirds but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much this movie doesnt if it didnt have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand it would have been shafted straight to tv or canned in the postproduction maybe even before br br like i said the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play busteds song thunderbirds are go i cant believe i wasted 7 watching this through payperview
