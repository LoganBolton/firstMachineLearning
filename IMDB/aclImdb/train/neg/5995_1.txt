this is a truly awful film what they have done is taken a tv show which was never aimed at young children  given it the george lucas treatment ie ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audiencebr br ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasnt exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch especially when the models got blown up and the voice cast wasnt too badbr br this suffers from bad casting  bad acting with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope  ron cook as parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played  after this travesty i wouldnt let frakes direct trafficbr br the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family  how they worked as a team preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disastersbr br avoid this rubbish like the plaguebr br i only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported
