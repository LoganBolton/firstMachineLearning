thunderbirds 2004 br br director jonathan frakes br br starring bill paxton ben kingsley brady corbet br br 54321 thunderbirds are go br br and so began thunderbirds a childhood favorite of mine when i heard that they were going to make a thunderbirds movie i was ecstatic i couldnt wait to see thunderbird 2 roar in to save people while thunderbird 4 would dive deep into theyou get the idea i just couldnt wait then came august 2004 when the movie was finally released critics panned it but i still wanted to go after all as long as the heart was in the same place that was all that mattered to me so i sat down in the theater the only teenager in a crowd of 50everyone else was over thirty and under ten quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that i have ever had br br the movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on alan tracy brady corbet the youngest of the tracy family he spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family but hes too young one day he finally gets his chance when the hood ben kingsley traps the rest of his family up on thunderbird 5 the space station this involves him having to outsmart the hoods henchmen and rescue his family in time before the hood can steal all of the money from the bank of englandbr br trust me the plot sounds like a regular episode of thunderbirds when you read it on paper once it gets put on to filmwhat a mess we have on our hands first off the film was intended for children much like the original show was however gerry anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for childrens programming this on the other hand dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the spy kids franchise the final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the thunderbirds series and children while missing both entirely lame jokes cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie and im sure that jonathan frakes is wishing hed never directed thisbr br over all everyone gave a solid performance considering the script that they were all given ben kingsley was exceptional as the hood playing the part extremely well my only complaint about the characters is about the hoods henchmen who are reduced to leftovers from old looney tunes cartoons bumbling about as amazingly enough the kids take them on with easebr br whats odd about this movie is that while i was watching the movie i had fun but once the lights went up i realized that the movie was fairly bad i was 8 lighter and two hours of my time were now gone a guilty pleasure perhaps nonetheless thunderbirds is a forgettable mess instead of a big go im going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie if the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it it would have been an incredible film worthy of the thunderbirds name however we get a movie that only diehard thunderbirds fans if youd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother withbr br my rating for thunderbirds is 1 ½ stars
