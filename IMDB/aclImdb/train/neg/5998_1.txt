the basic formula for the original series was take someone get the audience to like them then put them into mortal danger this formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 196468 br br now we jump forward 40 years to 2004 we are introduced to alan tracy a somewhat lessthandiligent college school kid with his friend fermat a young knowitall they are whisked off by lady penelope in her pink ford thunderbird to the island paradise where the tracy family live for the school holidays almost immediately they are left in the care of kyrano and his daughter tintin whilst the adults go to rescue john from thunderbird 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident this is all part of the hoods scheme to take over tracy island so that he can steal the thunderbird machines br br to rob a bankbr br yes the plot is as limp as thatbr br the dialogue is banal the acting more wooden than that of the fibreglass puppets the effects anything but special and hans zimmers score what little there was of barry grays glorious theme shone through zimmers lackluster orchestration the rest of the score was eminently forgettable in fact part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didnt recognise it i didnt even bother to stay to witness busteds mediocre efforts with the end titlesbr br to be fair ron cook worked quite well as parker he and sophia myles as penelope seemed wasted with the right material they could have been show stoppers the cgi work was what i would have called leading edge  5 years agobr br the dynamics of the main craft were just wrong the original series models at least moved as if they had massbr br another sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements from every vehicle being built by ford to the entire content of the tracy freezer being produced by ben  jerrysbr br my son 9 enjoyed the film but this cross between spy kids and clockstoppers aimed squarely at his age group added nothing to the thunderbirds legend when star trek hit the big screen in 1979 with the motion picture a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so with this film frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the thunderbirds franchisebr br i predict that this film like the avengers and the saint before it will sink into obscurity within 6 months leaving the original series to its classic status
