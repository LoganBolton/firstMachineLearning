ive always thought that most huge boxoffice flops usually have something to recommend them but after the remake of around the world in 80 days and thunderbirds im beginning to doubt it for those not familiar its based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters falling bridges stricken planes burning buildings etc each week well the puppets are gone replaced by far more lifeless teenagers and so is the premise  only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from spy kids without any signs of imagination wit or entertainment young alan tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other traceys do because dad wont let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams grounded on a beautiful tropical island some punishment his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family  a bunch of identikit bleachblondes who look like a gay neonazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them  are stranded in space and he has to have the day by er running around the jungle making a phone call firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measurebr br the good points are few and far between one of them is that the film is mostly in focus the other is they all got to go to the seychelles which looks nicebr br the bad points where to start ben kingsleys career lowpoint performance the aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the childrens film foundation at its worst the almost complete lack of action or effects in a 70m scifi film the terrible script the lifeless direction the odious moralising but most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment this is a movie aimed straight at the undereights by people who know theyre making a kids movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience throwing in fifthrate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech this film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents favourite punishment for kidsbr br the biggest flop in british film history it didnt even cover the cost of prints and marketing its just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how not to make a summer movie
