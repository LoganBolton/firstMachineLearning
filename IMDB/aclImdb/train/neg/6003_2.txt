sundown  featuring the weakest dorkiest vampires ever seen accompanied by one of the most unfitting pretentious scores ever written  and with shane the vampire whos every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the restbr br the vampires dont seem to have any special powers at all  except for strength sometimes being able to switch off a lamp with their mind one time and thats it really ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight cause he ran out of bullets neither did i practically any other moviedracula would eat this one for breakfast skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicksbr br the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight  draculas vs some old geezers it could have been some good old bflick fun but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats mediocre acting and the laughable screenplaybr br in the end its just too silly to be funny sure it has some amusing moments but theyre few and far apart
