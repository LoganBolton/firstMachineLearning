the best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect its like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a jerry springer show you immediately can follow the skimpy plot identify the cardboard characters and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled however at times the director does something real unexpected it may be something extraordinarily stupid or something weird or something insightful the director makinen is up there with the best camp directors and this is his best moviebr br in yon saalistajat everything seems to come together theres nothing good about it but still manages to be a coherent whole not once does the movie slow down  the action flows on and punches keep on comingbr br the weirdest thing is that theres no sense of time some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar this is partially due to finnish summer where the sun never sets so you dont experience the day turning into a night at allbr br finally there is a plot there somewhere you may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it though
