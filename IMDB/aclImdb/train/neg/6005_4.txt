this is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this onebr br this is quite a depressing film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demisebr br gwen verndon showed that she could still dance too bad the movie didnt concentrate more on that maureen stapleton looking haggard still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust ballroom so much more down to earth from 10 years earlierbr br i only hope that this film doesnt encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to thinkbr br why did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsensebr br if the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat why did steve guttenberg jump ship as well after all he had found his ladylove br br this would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay therebr br sadly with the exception of wilford brimley at this writing vernon gilford stapleton ameche tandy cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well
