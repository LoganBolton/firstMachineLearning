i didnt agree with any of the theology in the left behind series but nonetheless i found the books gripping and i read 8 of 12 of them undeniably good writing and interesting story however i didnt have very high expectations for the movie there was no way mainstream hollywood would have taken up a christian series and produced a bigbudget movie so it was done independently and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show it just didnt feel like a movie it didnt have that movie experience to it if anybody knows what im talking about so the movie suffered because of that and the lowbudget poor special effects were another detraction for mebr br on top of that i feel that gordon currie was woefully miscast as nicolie carpathia reading the book my impression of nc was that he was supposed to be this charming dazzling amazingly handsome guy who spoke english with almost zero trace of an accent so i imagined somebody like pierce brosnan in the role instead they found some clay aiken pencilneck who looks like an employee of the month from best buy and gave him a really bad fake accent so that lost a few stars for me right there a movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesnt look or sound the way hes supposed tobr br the acting was okay but nothing to write home about some of the scenes  like one of the conversion scenes cant remember which one  were real seatsquirmers for me and some of the christian rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes like in the one with kirk cameron praying in the bathroombr br in short it wasnt a bad movie but it just didnt do it for me stick to the book folks its much better
