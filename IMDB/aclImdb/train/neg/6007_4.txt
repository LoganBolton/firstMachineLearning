surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end for the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one with a small budget insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with itbr br its silly that with all the money going around in the christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with im not a religious so i couldnt care less really but filmmaking does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance in that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunitybr br the low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down it makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy bmovie like feelingbr br but whats hurting this movie more is its writing the stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then im not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story the way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that its being insulting to its viewersbr br i also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up i just couldnt cared less really at timesbr br still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end when its story gets more focused on its essence still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned there are far worser one to watch out there though i dont think this movie will win over any new soulsbr br 410
