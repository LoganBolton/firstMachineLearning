if you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book please dont give up on the series i bought my first copy of any of the books in may of this year and already im almost finished with book 10 i dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesnt do the series even a sniff of justice while left behind the movie only vaguely follows the story of the left behind the book the characters arent even close to accuratebr br a few examples rayford never acts on his feelings for hattie he is about to when hes informed of the vanishings buck williams is a blonde haired magazine writer not a tv reporter chloe is at stanford and a lot of the book details rayford wondering if she survived buck and chloe dont meet until much later at a meeting in new york set up by hattie irene and raymie are never in the book rather just in rayfords flashback thoughts the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that rayford and hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs etc etc etcbr br and thats just from the first movie theyre about to release the third please even if you didnt like the movies give the book series a chance
