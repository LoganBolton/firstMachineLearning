what is it with americans and their hangup with religious gobbledygook to think this was a bestselling novel is incredible but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers in this case all the good actors have gone to heaven and were left with kirk cameron as a cnntype journalist trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared oh yeah theres a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine or something the good news is that this is done so cheaply and with such inane dialogue that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs not recommended for anyone with a 3digit iq
