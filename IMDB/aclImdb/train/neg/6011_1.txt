i didnt expect much from this film but oh brother what a stinkerbr br i found this gem in a giant crate of awful 5 dvds at walmart where else as cheap as this disc was i feel ripped off the special effects had a high school look to them the camera work marred by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the christian school one can imagine the long and exhausting prayer meetings by the production company after seeing the rushes come back  the people who bankrolled this thing must have had seriously antibiblical feelings towards the inept production company that cranked this thing out think of their anguish as they saw their 91486 investment go up in smokebr br someone asked why christian movies are so bad  perhaps the xian filmmakers need to look at good movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good believable stories and characters less hysterical armwaving and fanaticism oh and a story that appeals to everyone not just true believers ie stop the sermon save it for church take the omen or prophesy series for example excellent films with compelling story lines great cinematography and intense music no hysterical armwaving no preachingbr br if this film had a laugh track it would have been much better
