ive read every book to date in the left behind series and the movie hardly does any of them justice sure ive seen worse movies but this was incredibly disappointing this movie would have made a good mst3k episode the script was a horrible adaptation of the book and it felt like the actors were reading their lines instead of actually saying them the characters were stiff and unlikeable the effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake the ending was awful first of all it didnt even go all the way through the first book second it made no sense if you hadnt read the book youd have no idea what was going on it had to have been the most cheesy film studentlike ending ive ever seen in a movie im upset that i actually paid money for this movie if by some miracle it does get wide release they ought to totally overhaul it and let hollywood take over those two wannabe film producers and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals
