this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom it is yet another thinly veiled evangalizing rapture religious movie with the good guys the believers suddenly vanishing and the bad guys the nonbelieversleft behind its an interesting concept especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a nonbeliever who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard needless to say that sinner doesnt disappear either unhappily with all the pilots being nonbelievers the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag the acting is horrible and the obviously computergenerated simulations are very fake looking plus its yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city spare meill just read the bible
