 of course theres spoilers  im sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies female protagonist  check bad things happen to drug takers  check heorine knocks out villain  check heroine doesnt notice villain recovering unconsciousness  check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine  check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class  dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here  in fact theres so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long hes been killing people on the underground  im led to believe its the result of some human experiment and perhaps its not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought theyd be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and theres always a market for horror movies  likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that its slightly better than 1972s death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground  its just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head
