i like endofdays movies i like bmovies i was hoping i would like this moviebr br i could ignore the poor effects the often atrocious music the cringeinducing lines i could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable given the subject matter i could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys none of these things kill the movie what kills this movie is that its just plain and simple boring nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators morals on the viewers at the cost of actually having a coherent story or any kind of suspensebr br if youre looking for an entertaining bmovie look elsewhere this movie is just boring
