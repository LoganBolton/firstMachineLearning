im getting a little tired of people misusing gods name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world well i dont dismiss the idea of armageddon or the coming of the antichrist i do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good livesthey seem to be mostly white christian children will go to heaven while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of hell on earth just because we werent good enough god may be a judge but i dont think he is going to measure every level of goodness give the creator some credit
