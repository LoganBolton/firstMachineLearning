if you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the un israel and international affairs come from look no furtherbr br this isnt a supernatural hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage instead this movie was made by a company cloud ten pictures with a political and religious agenda as a movie the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playingbr br for mainstream viewers it may be hard to believe but many people believe in this stuff literally as presented in the movie and that perhaps makes the movie important you probably wont find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens so if you view it view it as a socialcultural document if you are at all media savvy you dont need to be warned about the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie
