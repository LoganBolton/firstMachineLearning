its been a while since seeing this the first time so i watched it again with the second movie in the series while i realize there is a 3rd movie out that i havent seen yet ill review under the original titlebr br just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well what can you expect from a lowbudget b movie not much and it works from the standpoint of production however the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character developmentexactly what id expect when there is an agenda to a film i didnt have a problem with the actingthe cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves because the film is christian this is predictable as you cant very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with christianity in other words the mistake comes in making this into a grated film when the content even in the most conservative of bible interpretations would be rrated by any measure so if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right however you cant comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books there are certainly plenty of christian materials worthy enough to be made into moviesbut not the left behind seriesand these movies ultimately fail because while being bestsellers they are poorly written novels based on bad theologybr br as a southern baptist minister i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series i have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times then i could live with that however this series is divisive in christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all scripture above a more proper hermeneutic inevitably this leads to the pretrib premillenial dispensation point of view which confines an allpowerful god far too by humanitys world in other words as ive always said god shouldnt need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work but because many people particularly unstudied christians cant think beyond their own worldviews we are left with a proconservative fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretationbr br thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible i recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind because of his nonadherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldnt possibly hold to another eschatology this is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in scripture and its connection to real endtime prophecy is tenuous at bestbr br but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the christian community and how they portray true christian behavior ultimately i feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faithreligion instead of win people towards it it turns all christians into caricatures equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice as a christian body on the whole weve done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of historyand we certainly dont need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of othersbr br thus the left behind movies fail because the left behind books arent worthy to be interpreted into movies
