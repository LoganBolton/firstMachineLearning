im a christian who generally believes in the theology taught in left behind that being said i think left behind is one of the worst films ive seen in some timebr br to have a good movie you need to have a wellwritten screenplay left behind fell woefully short on this for one thing it radically deviates from the book sometimes this is done to condense a 400page novel down to a twohour film but in this film i saw changes that made no sense whatsoeverbr br another thing there is zero character development when characters in the story get saved i wont say who the book makes it clear that its a long soulsearching process in the film its quick and artificial the book is written decently enough where people like rayford steele buck williams and hattie durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial in another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again i wont say who it seems artificialbr br i realize as a christian its unedifying for me to say i disliked this film but i cant in a good conscience recommend a film that i feel was horribly done perhaps it wouldve been better to make the first book into 23 films either way christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way i realize a lot of effort probably went into left behind but thats the way i see it
