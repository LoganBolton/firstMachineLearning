i had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes and that is exactly what i wasbr br of course it is campy of course some of the dialog wasnt perfect of course the special effects were a bit hokey that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much it is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70s horror classicbr br the talent needs to start some where that goes for the actors and the crew and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than thisbr br i for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors
