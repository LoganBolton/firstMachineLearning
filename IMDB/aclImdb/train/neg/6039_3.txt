the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness  starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations the evil dead 1982 style from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him he succeeds  not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative two days later  ray travis quentin young along with his sister dawn erica hoag her boyfriend nick craig bonacorsi  four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin the evil dead style with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude shows up with his axe  starts to slaughter the friends onebyonebr br edited written executive produced  directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me im just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes it has every bad slasher clich√© the characters are awful the dialogue is terrible  its hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film the teens are even more annoying  stupid than usual the script is more moronic predictable  flawed than usual  the killer lumberjack dude is just lame then theres the final 10 minutes or so which if you make it that far  believe its tough going produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as im concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesnt want to know it stop reading now basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story  it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen  nick  dawn  everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story i felt their pain  then proceed to pick holes in it  laugh at it from saying why did they stand around  argue why didnt they pick the axe up  such things i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap  to have it shoved down my throat  made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap  could see all the holes in it  went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes which we have just had to sit through remember is just a little grating then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up  kills everyone within two minutes why didnt he do that to start with it would have saved everyone a lot of timebr br director portugal turns in a real mess this has the worst continuity between night  day in a film i have ever seen the whole film is meant to set at night  i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didnt work  most of it looks like it is set during the day for example look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom  she climbs out of the window it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground  the films cuts to an exterior shot its bright daylight then theres the fact ranger vince says we cant get a search party out here until the morning indicating it was supposed to be night then several minutes later when he walks outside  it looks like its the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on  he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like its night anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows its pitch black outside  when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen there isnt much gore there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable its not scary theres no tension or atmosphere  the appalling day  night continuity is just so distracting because its so obviousbr br technically the film is rock bottom again the continuity between night  day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is the special effects are poor  they couldnt even afford to show a car blowing up even though its pretty vital to the plot this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish the acting is absolutely brilliant  everyone involved should get an oscar nah only joking not really they were utterly awful  even the girls who got their breasts out werent very good lookingbr br the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam it has awful effects is boring  has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or ive got it totally wrong  its the most clever not recommended watch a decent slasher from the 70s or 80s to remind you how they should be done
