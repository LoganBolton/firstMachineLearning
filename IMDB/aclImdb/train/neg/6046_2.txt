this film is basically two hours of dafoes character drinking himself  nearly literally  to death the only surprise in this film is that you didnt have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised it was just a grim sad waste of timebr br willem dafoe is excellent actor peter stormare is an excellent actor but this film just sucked slow doesnt make the movie bad it was just bad the sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail arent cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end i really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep seriously i fell asleep and had to rewatch the film  which was even more disappointingbr br i generally dont like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one its just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result
