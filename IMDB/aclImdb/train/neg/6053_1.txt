absolutely trash i liked halloween and from then on johnnys been in a downward spiral this is about the pits we get it john prolifers are scary you dont have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to tell mebr br the pacing is way off here it feels like john didnt have much to work with here to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk there are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb i love the long cut too bad carpenter doesnt know how to employ it he needs to bunk up with herzog and fassbinder 30 years ago please john stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death
