i originally gave this episode a rating of two i now wish id thought more about it i also wish they had negative rating optionsbr br watching it i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish i adore ron pearlman and john carpenter so what went wrong last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue i think that this season mr carpenter managed to make something so greyarea that you cant immediately see if he is prochoice or antiabortion it was only after i sat and thought about it that i realized he is very much antiabortion you get this most clearly in the end when the mother shoots the baby and kills it to the dismay of the father who walks off in grief leaving the mother unharmed but you also see it in the way the ron p character is treated i hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him only to pay for it in the end i dont mind someone having a strong view on something even if it isnt something i agree in but i do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view rather than trying to look like theyre sitting somewhere in the middlebr br but political issues aside this episode was beyond poor the music was retro70s and just plain didnt work the acting other than ron p was poor the effects were dreadful it might have been better just to not show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they hadbr br all this being said im glad they have the masters of horror i dont mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while i do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from masters some of these people just plain dont deserve the title let me stress tho even tho i hated this episode john carpenter totally deserves the title he is a master thru and thru
