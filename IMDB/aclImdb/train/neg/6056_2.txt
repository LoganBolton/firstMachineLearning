to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointmentsmost of these socalled masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their subpar effects and laughable story linesaside from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their lifethe gunshots sounded like someone was playing bopit under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealisticoverall this film is about as scary as home alonethe only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe peltsi dont know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand
