i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloweenthe fogchristinethe thing  probably his best filmsbr br then you got this pos i cant logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns at least his son made a decent soundtrackbr br you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didnt seem like a movie it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing i wont believe carpenter put any effort into this at allbr br i was just listening to his old school h2h3the fog soundtrack and it was awesome especially for the timesbr br he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films
