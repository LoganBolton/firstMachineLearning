ill keep this short as a movie like this doesnt deserve a full reviewbr br given the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another 28 days later or even a blair witch projectbr br the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i dont think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london undergroundbr br characters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really dont care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or twowhether intentional of the writers or notbr br the main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i wont spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling matchbr br all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the markbr br just to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away
