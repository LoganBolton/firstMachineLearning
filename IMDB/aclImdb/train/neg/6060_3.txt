there is this girl and shes running in the woods but she ends up at this womans clinic and she wants an abortion her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it the whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic im not really prochoice but i wanted the choice to kill this episode i was laughing when i saw the baby come out and it went into the corner the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too i was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode he just wanted to protect his daughter and i couldnt really blame him for what he did i dont know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room i was just laughing too hard and i would suggest watching pick me up instead of this episode it wasnt the worst episode but it wasnt that great
