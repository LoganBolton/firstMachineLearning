masters of horror has proved itself a poor arena for message episodes and while a definite case can be made for joe dantes screwfly solution one of the best episodes of the series period most efforts to do so have come across as anvilheavy and unimpressive nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox and prolife simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultraviolence young angelique caitlin wachs seen running through the woods is nearly hit by 2 doctors mark feuerstein and emmanuelle vaugier who just happen to be driving in to work at the local and isolated abortion clinic angeliques father dwayne ron perlman is a stonecold farright holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion if for nothing else prolife accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifferencehe seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself which is admittedly poor the slow pacing builds no tension and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl even when dwayne and his sons storm the clinic guns blazing it is a stunning nonevent later when a doctor is tortured with a male abortion the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessaryan effort to pad out the underwritten film the poor performances perlman is sadly wasted here become an outgrowth of the script and carpenters direction feels exhausted as if prolife is the source of his next hot meal by the time a spidercreature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking
