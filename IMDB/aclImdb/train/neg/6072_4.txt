deniro is a masterone of my favourites and i love good sports movies not into baseball so much but hey its sports movies right i was expecting much more for this movie it seems to start out well deniro is what i expected snipes whom i dont really like is very good as the spoiled star barkins role to me was ok shes a good actress but seemed out of place in this role to me they always seemed to rush the scenes and then it drags a bit in places it just seemed tio me to be so uneven considering the cast and the plot it could have been so much better i rated it a 4 and i was being generous  im a tough one with numbers
