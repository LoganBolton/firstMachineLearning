one of the worst movies ive ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless clich√© of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic  the movie meanders into nothing spoiler were to believe that a knifewielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heartstrings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
