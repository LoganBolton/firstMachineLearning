would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didnt contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isnt any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they dont appear to live anywhere or have parents because prn films dont need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i havent ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
