although there are a lot of familiar television names associated with a man called sledge there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances in fact the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960s70s television series like the rat patrol is a bigger cast and a lot more violence br br james garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing maverick support your local sheriffgunfighter etc unfortunately his earthy likability works against him as sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of clint eastwoods spaghetti western character but eastwoods stuff was not this flat and uninterestingbr br i suppose that a man called sledge could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that subgenre fans of the slowpaced combat television series will feel an instant connection as vic morrow directed the film and cowrote the script with frank kowalski throw in some then trendy slowmo shots and crossdissolves which call attention to themselves rather than serve a storytelling purpose br br the plot is the standard big heist thing insert the war wagon here with sledge plotting how to heist a 300000 gold shipment his gang includes claude akins and dennis weaver the problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison i think there was an episode of alias smith and jones with the same plotbr br the story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewers interestbr br the thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game br br then again what do i know im only a child
