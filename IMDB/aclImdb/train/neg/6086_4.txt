for some reason in the late 70s and early 80s the local cbs affiliated station in new york kept playing this movie in its latenight slot on friday or saturday nights for several years usually at 2 am or some such time its a fitting movie for that time slot since its really hard to follow and quite odd see the other reviews for specific story info anyway after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable tv and even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming i kept catching this little oddity after not seeing it for many years i decided to see if i could find it on dvd well it is only available from every search ive conducted anywayin a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label brentwood video as part of a 4pack of movies 4 movies on 2 double sided discscalled alien worlds if anyone is interested its usually available for around 10but even much less if you shop around the other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies so no need to comment on them here but i havent seen eyes available anywhere else though hardly a restored version in any way this print runs exactly 92 minutes so for once imdbs stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct even with the 92 minute running time its not unusual for a movie dubbed into english from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed it seems to be a common budgetconscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story would a longer version make in any less confusing who really knowsunless youve seen it in its native language by the way my attempts to watch this during the day dont work and i end up just turning it off theres something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movieor maybe its just from my earlier experiences who know
