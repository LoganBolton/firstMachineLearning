why do i watch movies like this   other than i have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day i will find a true gem amongst all this dross i cant think one one good reason this movie was dross from start to finish  but semihilarious dross where else but in a bad italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges of surreal mangled english like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret xfiles like organisation dedicated to hiding the truthbr br man in black silence is best for us until we are able to prove that the ufos have no bellicose motivesbr br military type in any event i find your interference abusivebr br man in black whoever has to impose his will isbr br i rewound the dvd you know what i mean a good half dozen times and i still cant make those lines mean anything sensible my other fave line wasbr br we can be quite hard on those who contravert our interestsbr br its english jim but not as we know it br br the other highlights of this dull plonker of a movie for me were the totally spaced out acting of the photographer character at the start saddled with the worst haircut ever in the history of everything the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig till kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of plexiglas by some aliens the aliens are most effectively not seen as a pov shot  hand held camera with a fisheye lens  sort of spooky the first time but used over and over again it lost its power incidentaly if it is a point of view shot it means the aliens always walk out of rooms backwards for some reasonbr br the film was set in england this meant the spanish italian set designers put some british number plates on a couple of english cars and put a union jack on our heros press card and that was about it no other attempt to make it look like the uk at allbr br favourite moment when the foley artists didnt notice that characters they were foleying is there such a word were no longer walking on gravel but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud crunch crunch noises other than that another total waste of 90 minutes of my life i hope they prove those ufos have no bellicose motives soon
