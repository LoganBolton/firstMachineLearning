i like movies about ufos which is why i recently decided to rewatch eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s and now im compelled to write a review about it because im afraid ill start forgetting everything about it fast you see even though ebts aint bad its very dull and nondescript the story is sorta interesting but flat the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling which unfortunately this one aintbr br also theres very little violence and theres no nudity whatsoever which makes this 1970s italian scifi opus a true oddity because if theres one thing that distinguishes italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade its the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them oddly enough because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements ebts stands out from the rest of the pact i dont know if this can be seen as a compliment though personally i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think ebts needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry and the special effects arent that specialbr br the story itself is actually interesting its a combo of the xfiles and antonionis blowup a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographers apartment this taking place just before shes to be abducted herself the man takes some of the negatives and leaves with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue in the spy vs spy variety the ufo element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war mcguffin but as dull as eyes behind the stars is it does resemble the xfiles a lot i wonder if chris carter saw this movie anyway the best thing in ebts are the pov shots which are creepy and effective but the rest is almost completely forgettable including the goofy looking aliensbr br even though ive been mostly negative about this film i sorta cherish it nonetheless i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid and i own the video the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly oh well
