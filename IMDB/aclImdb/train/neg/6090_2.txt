originally called the changer the nostril picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe bukowski carl zschering who likes em young unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special vietnamese chant this chant involves whistling london bridge is falling down whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer nonetheless ugly joe tries it out and hey presto he is now a girl ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls but lets not talk about ideals here  this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 in an ideal world it should have never been releasedbr br the film asylum dubbed this horror hokum as mind numbing ham handed story telling its worse than that the nostril picker really takes the biscuit in fact the whole goddamn cookie jar terribly scripted dialogue delivered by braindead actors a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist just when things couldnt get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent for instance joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself but i thought he wanted to get close to them not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims of which there were only around 34br br the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker steven andrews then taking her back to his apartment what happens next defies belief joe turns back into a man but also discovers the hooker is a man how does he react well in a benny hillesquire fashion he chases her around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildos only to trip up on a blow up doll god knows what patrick j matthews and stephen hodge were thinking of at least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment this involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2bit joke shop cop uniform the hilarious acting is a must see especially the hookers inability at saying dildo and his demand for satisfactionbr br apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore you know a movies bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting normally id fast forward to the good bits only there werent any here the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly forget quick cuts matthews utilizes fadeouts one during a stab scene to limit any form of suspense there might already be one girls nonreaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable normally id relish the words uncut but in this case they were far from a blessing just more agonizing cinematic torture the whole movie felt like an unedited episode of midsummer murders only less entertaining id hate to see the cut versionbr br to sum up the nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing ive seen since richard hammonds 5 o clock show dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing dont be fooled by the box label this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the letsuseshittyhorrordvdsforcoffeecoasters cult which i think it does unless reedited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess
