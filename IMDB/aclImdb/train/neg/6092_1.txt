someone must have been seriously joking when they made this filmbr br firstly it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in 1993 the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80s my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving worldbr br there is a plot kind of a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loners favourite song is london bridge is falling down why is this his favourite song because hes an idiot we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity it gets even stupiderbr br the loner is the nostril picker i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose that clears up the title he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls and kill them thats more or less itbr br the acting is universally appalling every single performance in this movie sucks in fact i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie it really is that terrible the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down man i feel like an idiot even typing this anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls and not in a good way there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded im not even going to describe it youll know it when you hear it and youll agree with mebr br there are some scenes of violence sure and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual there is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton where the nostril picker says to a prostitute ive got the cash if youve got the gash lovely im sure youll agreebr br utter nonsense
