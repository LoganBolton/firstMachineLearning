this has to be the worst film i have ever seen i bought the dvd and it didnt work well the dvd worked fine its just the film didnt in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since or before judging from the acting there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphonebr br all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didnt know any better which have been an improvement there are only two lines in the film that are funny both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes forbr br as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated i mean reading the back i expected it to be badbr br he chose his weapons he selected his victims he picked his nose he turned into a girlbr br but i thought it might be funny also the case claims it is digitally re mastered i would love to have seen it beforehand the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie in what way disgusting production actingbr br this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes if you are considering buying this i would say buy bad taste instead it is a much better film and is funny also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in itbr br incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors or director patrick j mathews and what they have done since please post here as i would love to know purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
