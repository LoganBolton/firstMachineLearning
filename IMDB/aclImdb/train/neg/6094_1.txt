ive been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasonsbr br 1 this is without doubt the worst film ive ever seen 2 unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list  which it deserves to be 3 i was kinda lucky  i paid five pound for it ive seen it in shops for 15 pound don not pay that much for this film you will be very angry 4 there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating in my opinion and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminalbr br the plot summary a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world  well the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang  sitting on swings babysitting he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the policebr br why is it so bad to begin with the acting is very very bad someone else compared it to a school production no this is worse than any acting ive seen on a school stagebr br ive bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense what was the point in making this film when there isnt even any gore okay no gore what else can a film like this offer breats no not even any titillationbr br its true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyerwatcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is at best worth only one out of ten
