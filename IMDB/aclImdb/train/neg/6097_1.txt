back in 1985 i caught this thing i cant even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after 30 minutes in rememberthis was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie ive seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business nobudget and boring ta skip it
