this was a less than exciting short film i saw between features on turner classic movies recently while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor the film itself just wasnt that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesylike this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience wasnt even a consideration in particular i really hated how many times in the film things were reiteratedsuch as when the characters talked to her they usually said clara barton instead of maam miss barton or clara plus one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a johnny reb a confederate a rebelalmost like he was the cartoon character mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls this was just sloppy writingperiodbr br it was interesting to see john hamilton later perry white on the superman tv show in a beard as president garfield yepits him under that beard
