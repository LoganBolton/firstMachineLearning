this was an absolutely terrible movie dont be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movies ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudolove affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actors like christopher walkens good name i could barely sit through it
