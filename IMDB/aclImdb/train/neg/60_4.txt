i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for 550 at walmart i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purposebr br then of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as im concerned i dont think this scene added to the movie at all i dont like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some 60s burn out especiallybr br in the end although im glad to possess another hawn movie im not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it
