effort aside this isnt a review about good intentions its about the final product this film is poorly written overacted and poorly directed the story obviously had potential but that story is nowhere present in this filmbr br clara barton was a human being she had passions desires love pain embarrassment weakness and self doubt just like the rest of us you would never know that from this film of the lead actresss performance in fact apply that to every character in the film but in bartons case every sentence is a speech an epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot in fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting and i realized thats because shes making a speech every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot for example when she sees a wounded man shell start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags etc as played in the film theres no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in secondsbr br in conclusion this film robs clara barton of her struggles it robs her of her humanity and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clich√©s the writer doesnt know clara barton and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia britannica article yes they had those back then but hey nice technicolor who cares
