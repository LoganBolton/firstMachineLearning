almost a twoperson play and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important neither are particularly good this might have been stronger in fact if it had first been crafted as a twoperson play and then worked into a filmbr br anyway a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home he wants to have her tell him about the daylight he would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet but then they might not have a hot bodbr br after he gets her to do whatever he wants and hes not terribly good at it he intends to feed on her at 6 am at which point the sun rises much is made of that deadline despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding it will just make him hungrier additionally he claims he cant let the stripper go since she knows about him but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is there are a lot of inconsistenciesbr br why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime im not sure with all the time in the world youd think hed have done a better job or fixed the place up a bit hes clearly not a wealthy vampirebr br this is supposedly a remake and im curious to see the original version of this dance of the damned although that was directed by katt shea and the other films she directed for corman stripped to kill stk ii were pretty bad
