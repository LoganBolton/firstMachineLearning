to be honest im surprised by the positive votes that this film has received the movie just drags along its 81 minute life span and the audience has to suffer the whole way through actually there are some positive moments in this film charlie spradling gives a decent performance she is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well scott valentinemerrideths boyfriend in family ties on the other hand is a pretty rough watch i guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tigerpatterned chummiesgive me a break also valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the dayto see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see denice duff in bloodstorm subspecies 4 the movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by and to be honest charlie spradlings dance scenes this movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fans of charlie spradling which i am and i still had a rough time watching it
