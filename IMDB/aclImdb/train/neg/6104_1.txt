fungicide is quite possibly the most incompetent embarrassing pitiful film i have ever seen the acting is criminal the direction practically nonexistent and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computerbr br far be it from me to stifle creativity but i actually believe things like this shouldnt be made i am sure the filmmakers will say that yes the film was hampered by a low as in nothing budget  but in that case they just really shouldnt have bothered as it is they have offered the world something so dire so execrable that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from itbr br starting the movie it wasnt as though i was expecting citizen kane or anything i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness a hint of fun and even some energy what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchiefbr br the plot well our leering antihero scientist who works in his parents basement is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup apparently such highlevel science is the endresult of years of research his parents then send him off to a strange hoteltype place in the countryside to relax there are some other people there who are simply too awful to write about anyway the scientist drops his testtube onto some mushrooms  and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people wow im getting suicidal just writing the plot summary our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar by attaching a fuse  really a piece of string  to it the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon destroying all the mushrooms the end thank goodnessbr br that summary is as good as the film gets and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is it really should never have got past this stage of development by which i mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said no br br and those special effects well theyre special all right this is cgi gone crazy and done by a person who i can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet i kid you notbr br one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns a la clint eastwood and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets i mean come on a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off but just to leave it as it is  really weakbr br i cannot believe money was spent on this camcordershot rubbish the filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any moviemaking equipmentbr br i also think its wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the movie fungicide is an absolute travesty of filmmaking mr wascavage is either very very stupid or very very cynical
