tarzan the ape man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to burroughs literary character but while the 1932 tarzan was reduced to tarzan  jane speech this tarzan played by miles okeeffe doesnt speak or even grunt he does do the the tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier filmbr br no tarzan plays second banana to bo derek as jane or rather as third banana to bo dereks left breast and her right breast this movie has no point but to show derek nakedbr br the two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad more evidence that no one caredbr br bizarrely enough tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film maybe he car pooled in from sumatra with the indian elephants that are also on display
