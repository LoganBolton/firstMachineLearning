i cant say this is the worst movie ever made but personally i think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters 1 the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it and we actually stood in line to get tickets and 2 its still the only serious film i recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through once we reached the infamous and interminable snake fight scene i think everyone gave upbr br the only positive i can concede is the lush location shooting oh and theres also bos breasts although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesnt rate much more than a playboy pictorialbr br the dramatic tension in this film is between bos terrible acting and her husbands horrible direction the snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent action sequences ever filmed however this is one of those films thats bad enough it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor definitely the worst film i ever paid to see
