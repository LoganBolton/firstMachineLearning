this is a reimagining of tarzan in the era of the soloflex and apocalypse now theres nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend theres nothing inherently wrong with the premise that tarzan doesnt speak theres plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in 1910 could be this offensively stupid and plastic bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a videocenterfold as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project if it succeeds anywhere its in the implication that national geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructedbr br it would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldnt employ the sexual tease as one of many tools to draw in viewers some really great film moments incorporate it but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum  the tease is the only thing going on here at the time of its release and now you sit through awful dumb scenes that offer no interest and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies yes bo derek and miles okeeffe are beautiful um congratulations on having a working libido but if thats your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up theres only a hairsbreadth difference between the two formats and im just guessing here a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alonebr br as a showman john derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife bo in the movie 10 and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads the movie itself was beside the point he was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficialitybr br as a director john derek appears to require only that mrs derek look pleasant empty and humpable in every scene its hideously shot the camera placement is annoying in terms of editing the entire wipe catalog is exhausted the credit sequence is garish and its a tossup as to who commits the worse screen offense bo derek whos such a bimbo that she cant even figure out how to play a bimbo or richard harris who shouts every line as he likes to do until you want to shoot him at least with bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her
