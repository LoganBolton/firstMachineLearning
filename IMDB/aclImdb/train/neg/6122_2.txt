surely one of the most illadvised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tagline “the most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time” isn’t even properly exploited although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days its notoriety for awfulness not erotic content mind you kept me away from it until now – and i only relented because i have recently enjoyed bo derek’s previous film 10 1979 and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas periodbr br lead actressproducer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirlish sexual innocent witness the inept banana scene and as was to be expected she is made to get her clothes off a few times but as welcome as these scenes were she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here richard harris then chews the scenery incessantly as jane’s obsessed explorer father but john philip law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in jane herself newcomer miles o’keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel which is probably lifted from johnny weissmuller anyway and furthermore is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film’s second half for the record he later starred in two ator movies or wouldbe conan imitators for joe d’amato and the king arthurera set sword of the valiant 1984br br when still an actor director john derek who also serves as his own cinematographer here had worked with some good filmmakers cecil b de mille william dieterle and robert rossen and a few great ones otto preminger nicholas ray and don siegel but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability appallingly pretentious at times witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions this was derek’s seventh film as a director and his second of four with wife bo and eventually he would only get to make two morebr br the film’s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes which surprisingly enough i haven’t watched myself yet – a mere three years later nominated for six razzie awards including john derek richard harris and miles o’keeffe and winning one for bo derek herself tarzan the ape man was cowritten by gary goddard the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a this time animated heroic figure master of the universe 1987 which i will be revisiting presently as well yay despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an orangutan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and fatally john derek’s clear disinterest in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own selftitled movie
