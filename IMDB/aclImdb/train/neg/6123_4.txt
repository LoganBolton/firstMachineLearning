when i was a teenager seeing this film for the first time i thought it was one of the best movies ever made of course the reason for that is bo derek and her various states of undress in this film however now that im older i can honestly say that this film is awful mind you bo derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and husbanddirector john derek make sure you see plenty of her but when you take that aspect out of the film it becomes one big dull ride and tarzan well hes all muscular like you think he should be but when he sees jane thats bo of course for the first time he doesnt know what to think this despite the fact that bo is wearing a wet seethru shirt with her breast prominently displayed tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem if you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body then this might fill the ticket if you are looking for a thoughtful entertaining and worthwhile film go elsewherealmost anywhere else at that
