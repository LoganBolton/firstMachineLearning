whew what can be said about gymkata that hasnt already this is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing this is the perfect movie to get from cabots wildstyle mulletsweater combo to parmistan and its four billion assorted ninjas everything about this film reeks of crapbr br directed by robert clouse the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lees game of death he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent a few other faces you most likely wont recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well from buck kartalian to tadashi yamashita although you wont remember them or care about them after the movie is donebr br supposedly based on a book called the terrible game which if i could find a single trace of its existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it to see where this thing went wrong instead the book apparently is a figment of gymkatas imagination probably something clouse made up in order to sell his lame ideabr br pick this one up and yakmallah it for yourself it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen and that is saying quite a bit
