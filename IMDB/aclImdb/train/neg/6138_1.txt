this movie was godawful from conception to execution the us needs to set up a star wars site in this remote country this is their premise the way to gain access the us concludes is to win an obstacle course like crosscountry race where the winner can ask anything of the leader and who better to win this race known as the game than a gymnast of course a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission and dont forget that his father was an operative lucky for our hero there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town perfectbr br but above and beyond the horrible horibble premise is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever after winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government and lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the us gets its star wars site huzzah this is your triumphant ending wowbr br but still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch the cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this filmbr br but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas the gymnaststar in real life i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 12 twists in the layout position
