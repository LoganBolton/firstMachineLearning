wow what can i say about this film its a lousy piece of crap im surprised that it got rated as high as it did whats wrong with this film heres a better question whats not wrong with this filmbr br the story itself is just crap and clich√© heres pretty much what its aboutsome kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film if you havent seen this movie dont waste your time watching it also the second one isnt much better so dont bother watching that eitheri rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrows outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture
