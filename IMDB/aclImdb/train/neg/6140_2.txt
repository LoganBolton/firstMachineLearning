this movie is hilarious the problem is that its not a comedy one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommelhorse in the middle of a village square which he uses to pummel the bad guys another is the trek into the village of crazies too bad this movie wasnt made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings
