this is indeed quite the strange movie first we have an exusgymnast trying to turn actor or something and this seems to be the only role he ever got that i know of anyway  and for good reason while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest it is a rather bland and flat performance second we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie im not kidding this alone makes the movie extremely comical but in that annoying way hehe and third while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast including the required hot chick an actually notsobad story and some cool visuals the dialogue fight scenes involving gymnastics hilarious and overall execution of the plot are weak this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie too bad fox wasnt around in 1985 its one of those movies thats simply bad yet you cant resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable
