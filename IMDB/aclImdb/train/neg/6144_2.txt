ironically although he can do the splits thomas is a complete stiff as an actor br br this film is seared into my memory as one of the most sidesplittingly cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen as such im actually rather fond of it br br stillthe only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape and its fun to see his tiny muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the east european country side including the infamous pommel horse shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits br br thomas at least had the excuse that he wasnt really an actor everyone else in the film  actors director editor camera guys etc is at least as bad or even worse and most of them are professionals so kurt doesnt come off quite as badly as you might think br br i hope poor kurt took the money and ran if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again ill bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face
