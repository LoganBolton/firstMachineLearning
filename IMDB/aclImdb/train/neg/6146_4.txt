how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k ill never know gymkata is a ridiculous action movie filled or is that empty with paperthin plots dumb characters and preposterous situations but take it from me if you enjoy watching poor yet goofy movies you will enjoy gymkata a great dealbr br the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents at least i think they were government agents to become a spy you see his dad was another quasigovernment agent who has gone missing competing in this game called eloquently the game so the gymnast played blandly by kurt thomas trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dadbr br sounds promising doesnt it okay so it doesnt but still that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesnt begin to describe the joys of this movie they can be found in the movies strange details like the gymnasts mysterious asian girlfriend who doesnt speak for the first half hour of the movie then all of a sudden begins to talk and doesnt shut up for the rest of the time or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break the games nonexistent rules whenever he so pleases and of course theres our heros delightful romp through the village of the crazies evidently thats the places real name nice place to visit but i wouldnt want to live therebr br but where this movie really shines is the action scenes since our protagonist is a gymnast the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses it has to be seen to be believedbr br one interesting thing of note a lot id say about half the cast dies from being shot with an arrow interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie if these were indeed effects my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds more likely this was the films way of not paying extras nevertheless gymkata deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffingbr br
