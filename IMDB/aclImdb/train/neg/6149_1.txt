i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely having unfortunately dealt with lucas at such a young age howard is now caught up in so many of lucas traits how else do you explain his rampage of disasters his only useful film of course has been willow everything else including this is too reliant on superficial junkbr br some spoilersbr br he cant even have semiintelligent focus like peter weir no poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten br br here we have the old adage love conquers all even disease too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill heck even disney did better than this ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realitiesbr br howards commentary track is just awful dont even rent the dvdbr br final analysis   cinematic dud
