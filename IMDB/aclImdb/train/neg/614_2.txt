im watching this on the scifi channel right now its so horrible i cant stop watching it im a videographer and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad theyre surrounded by what must have been the directors relatives thats the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope its because there was absolutely no other option the sequel yes sequel is coming on nowi think ill skip it jason
