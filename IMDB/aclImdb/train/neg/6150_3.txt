i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepiatoned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfxcgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobelprice named after an actual person called alfred nobel the nobleprice jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
