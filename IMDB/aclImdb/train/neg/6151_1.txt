 and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood clichesbr br im 27 and ive spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations like the main character in the film i was successful mainly because of logic  because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasnt in the end i was really successful because of medication by the way but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasntbr br so i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud not only does it cheat with the main characters story who wasnt faithful to his wife who was bisexual  something really important here but mostly it shows a comforting tamed view of schizophrenia  which is entirely missing the pointbr br schizophrenia is a mind structure not a disease a schizophrenic isnt a normal man with a disease its someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  for him things like time space and peoples personalities arent solid things he feels it can be bent it can change it can mutate and maybe even disappear to cope with this a schizophrenic has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people dont expect  but hes trapped in it because he cant relate with most people and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank delusive dead endbr br this is very different to whats depicted in this ridiculous cure tearjerking movie it should be violently frightening people other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in lynchs eraserhead for example there should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because thats what schizophrenia is all about its not about detailsbr br i mean watch naked lunch lost highway read pk dicks martian timesplit or ubik do watch the cell perfect blue dark city or play american mcgees alice on pc and you may have a vague idea of what its like dont watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks the cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenics mind his visions and his inner consistency  its violent weird confusing and very very scarybr br once again schizophrenia isnt about details its not a neat tame trick played to you it jumps in your face and wont let you go  walls fall apart people turn into strange hostile creatures you feel like you go backward in time youre not sure youre who you think you are everything feels strange unnatural believe me this is much much more than whats depicted in this soaplike melodrama
