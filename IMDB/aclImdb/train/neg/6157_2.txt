yikes it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie for some of the names in the cast id expect a much better movie im almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part i hope the money was worth it and the students they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster i mean ive fenced its a fun sport but ive never been that intense the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back
