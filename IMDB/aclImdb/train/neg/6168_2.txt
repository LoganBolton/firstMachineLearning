hmm imdb rating of 75 good comments bla bla  okay two of my friends and me we orderd pizza sat down and wanted to see something as cool as ichi or at least something brainless but funny like versus but naked blood sucked its a complete waste okay the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding but thats it nothing more nothing less i wont summerize the plot other people did already i just wanted to stop the hype but watch it and rate for yourself maybe we can push the rating where it sould be one more thing that comes to my mind the soundtrack is even worse than carpenter ever was  okay johns cool   210
