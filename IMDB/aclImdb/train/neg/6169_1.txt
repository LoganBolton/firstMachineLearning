as a huge fan of horror films especially jhorror and also gore i thought nekeddo bur√¢ddo sounded pretty good i researched the plot read reviews and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed the plot was ridiculous and didnt even make sense and left too much unexplained the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying and what was with the cartoon style sound effects  the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it i did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light they left both pretty unexplained or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldnt understand what i was actually seeing i appreciate the way it was supposed to be shocking and a few scenes the strange cannibalism and own mother kissingcertainly were i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value but dont be expecting a dark deeply scary and horrifying film youll just be disappointed if this was a horror comedyspoof id probably rate it about a nine the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wifes stomach and closed up her wounds but as a horror sadly i gave it a one
