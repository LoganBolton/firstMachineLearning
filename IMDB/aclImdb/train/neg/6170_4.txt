this movie starts out very very slow but when the action finally gets started its a little had to follow i couldnt understand why some of the events were taking place and a lot of events happened before they were explained making them sort of confusing the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of bloodgore it has although most times the special effects are lacking blood looks like red koolaid skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks again the story has a sort of amateur feel to it like the writer didnt take a long time to perfect it i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script i honestly wish i hadnt watched it not because of the gore but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life if you like extremely gory movies this is for you if not stay away
