ill get to the movie in a minute first someone wanted proof about clintons comments at georgetown where he claimed that the usa deserved the 911 attacks well heres what clinton saidbr br in the first crusade when the christian soldiers took jerusalem they first burned a synagogue with 300 jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple mount i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for itbr br were still paying for it whaddya mean we paleface the marines didnt storm the temple mount br br but in truth clinton never really came out and flatly said that we deserved 911 like all his statements during his presidency he implied that we deserved 911 just point out fact a b c and maybe d and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion x when in truth most of clintons facts added up to guacamolebr br but thats beside the point were here to talk movies not politics unfortunately when oliver captain conspiracy stone does a movie you cant escape his warped politics it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the reagan era and what better time than when stones dreams almost came true on the day reagan nearly bought the farm unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in hinckleys assassination attempt he invents one with al haig from a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac you almost expect haig to rub his hands together like montgomery burns and tell cap weinberger to release the hounds stone even recruits the smarmiest person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state richard dreyfuss a guy you love to hate on sightbr br overall the movie is ok average hovering on below average dont bother renting or buying try to catch it on cable 4 out of 10
