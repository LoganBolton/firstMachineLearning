im not a big fan of the stooges slapstick but i find their history interesting ive recently tried to check out stuff from each stooge era but the opportunity to see joe shorts doesnt seem to come easy this is the only one ive seen so farbr br some say the quality problems with joeera shorts are really not joes fault and i suspect thats the case joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedyteamstooges ethos perhaps joes style was perceived by those in charge as not really fitting in  though there were no real offcamera conflicts between him  the others  and this was their way of working around thatbr br and whats with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts definitely a lack of creativity going on there was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up
