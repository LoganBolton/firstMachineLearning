first off let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie this entire movie had to have been a dare you know like dude i bet you couldnt make the worst movie ever with this movie theyve made a good effort at achieving that title the effects are of course poor the plotdialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made the actors im assuming are supposed to be in college yet parts of it especially at the beginning make it seem like theyre supposed to be in high or middle school it makes no sense the scarecrow going around killing people isnt the least bit enjoyable spoiler at the end when they chant lesters name and he reappears the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing probably out of relief they were on their last scene and at the cheesy dialogue
