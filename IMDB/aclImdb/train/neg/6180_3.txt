i attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations br br 1 just because youve directed a ton of music videos does not make you qualified to make movies the movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense horrible angles and terrible lighting the editing didnt help this mess at all when dixie shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but its never clear what the heck shes talking aboutbr br 2 the plot had promise but the script was thin and full of ford truck sized holes we never get to understand what drives the characters whats really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic the deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés in fact the whole town was one big cliché of southern life half the audience groaned when toby drawled ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurland we were treated to that insipid line not once but twice the revelations were yawn inducing and the dramatic confessions boiled down to i was stupid and stubbornbr br 3 the acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with toby was dark and brooding most of the film but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming its a shame he didnt have more screen time like that kelly prestons acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows lindsay haun is talented and its certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you dont blame her father for not coming to look for her burt reynolds and tess harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost and indeed their characters get lost in this film br br 4 if youre a toby fan youll love the songs but often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songsor the artists on his record label for instance the movies official love song is crash here tonight youd think that would play around a tender love scene but nopewe hear about 45 seconds of it as hes heading to a memorial service it was as if they said well we gotta use this song somewhere the song broken is haunting and the best thing to come out of this moviebr br in summarya promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for toby keiths music and product placement for ford trucks it goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video i like toby and really wanted to like broken bridges but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where
