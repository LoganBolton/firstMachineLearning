if youre a fan of mystery science theater 3k attack of the giant leeches or pinata survival island this movie might be for youbr br i live in nashville and i didnt even know of this movies existence until the day prior to its release when the advertising company panicked and blanketed music row with dozens of fliers and billboards it barely lasted two weeks in theaters anywaybr br bad acting bad writing and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film for starters the names are a bit much bo price angel and dixie eeshbr br tobys awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera angels character rapidly transitions from her cityslicker ways to a cowgirl slipping into southern slang after two days on the ranch her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of tobysin fact in the final scene their outfits are identical making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sickbr br the audio is inconsistent  perhaps the most noticeable example is when toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like hes shouting in a gymnasiumbr br theres never quite enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens onscreen overacting exasperation grimaces and moodiness best describes the actors interpretation and direction of the terrible scriptbr br this movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends but thats not saying much
