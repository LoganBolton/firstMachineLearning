this is by far the worst adaptation of jane eyre i have seen it is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by bronte george c scott is ridiculous and bumbling as rochester  when not just plain old acting angry susannah york has the most dated 1970s hairstyle i have ever seen in a victorian movie the characters hardly speak to each other so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love is gone the ending is ludicrousbr br please rent the timothy dalton version instead it is so true to the book its like having the novel read aloud to you dalton is superb as rochester g c scott is laughable
