i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television but the version put to dvd was a disaster the lighting was poor to nonexistent and entire scenes were simply excised in one instance adele is being put to bed and we immediately cut to another scene  coming in in midsentence  where its the next night characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced leaving one to wonder if theyd dozed off for a few minutes during the moviebr br the dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at 632 it was a gypbr br be careful which version of this movie you buy were sending this one back
