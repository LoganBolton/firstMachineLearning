perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see ill start with the bad points of t he movie which pretty much covers the entire film first of all something no one can avoid terrible acting i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked secondly badunconvincing character workdevelopment you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another the scarecrows character was overdone and a cheap ripoff of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead next bad dialog the scarecrow was full of horrid oneliners that would make you laugh only because it was so terrible lines like lets go find some small animals to torture really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester like 30 the back of his head was balding for gods sake there is much more i could say about this film like its cheap special effects its high school film class effort but the point is understood its just bad film making at its worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low low low standards would help put insomniacs to sleep a very cheap laugh or even a giggle
