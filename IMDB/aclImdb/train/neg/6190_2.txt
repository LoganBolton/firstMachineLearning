this tv production of 1970 starring susannah york and george c scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt jane eyre to the screen and how much can go wrong in doing so it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd  some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence but even if the editing were better the film would not be the script is bad the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte brontës novel at all the problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out  this is the case with all the short adaptations  but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone the spirit the atmosphere and the concept of the novelbr br this jane eyre for example completely leaves out gateshead and begins with janes arrival at lowood while this is perfectly all right since some scenes must by necessity be left out it is not understandable that instead of using the time gained so to speak and thoroughly portraying janes friendship with helen the influence helen has for janes development the lecture in christian stoicism that she teaches her the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical illtreatment of helen which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel but here miss scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward who deliberately wants to drive helen to a premature death and this is about all which happens at lowood if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in lowood have on jane in the novel one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in janes life and this is the problem throughout this adaptation it rushes from scene to scene very often without transition and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel the dialogues are an odd mixture of madeup lines and lines from the novel very clumsily patched together and the scenes between jane and rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel but the scriptwriter not only did brontës language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral setup with just one sentence when rochester and jane go to see rochesters wife after the wouldbe wedding rochester says yet i once loved her his wife as i love you now the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved and that his effort to seek a true life partner is if not sanctified by gods and mans law yet understandable and forgivable but this one sentence completely undermines brontës whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longerbr br from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely blonde blueeyed and fullmouthed susannah york as the novels plain heroine in addition ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it played by her the novels shy reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly poised graceful and mature woman completely sure of herself and her deserts i do not say that susannah york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not brontës jane eyre to cast george c scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70br br to compliment the maturity of the leading actors all passion desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding the emotional climax of the novel has become a calm rational conversation between two middleaged persons at the end of which rochester falls asleep when jane returns to him in the last scene he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old peoples home by his favourite granddaughter the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st john of all people ian bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for janes love is so touching that one gets the impression that bannen was modelling his st john on the rochester of the novel but good though bannen is his st john is just as far from the novel as yorks jane and scotts rochester the only redeeming features of this very disappointing jane eyre are the locations and the score and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of jane eyre
