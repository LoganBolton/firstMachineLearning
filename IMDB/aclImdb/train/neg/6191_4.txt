i watched this film along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on including seeing plays in preparation for some academic research the cinematography is very moving as is the music unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr rochester all of his most fundamental traits are gone where is his wit where is his passion scotts rochester more closely resembles rochesters foil stjohn than the character from the novel in fact the actor playing stjohn in this adaptation played a passionate stjohn while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling which he does all the time i have no idea what they were thinking i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly cant bear to see this film for too long because of george c scotts performance
