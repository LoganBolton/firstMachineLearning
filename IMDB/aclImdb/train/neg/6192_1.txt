the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way the script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless subplots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film ive ever seen i found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any waybr br i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they failed utterly it just bored me and i wish i had never watched itbr br avoid at all costs
