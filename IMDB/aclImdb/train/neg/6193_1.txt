i cant believe ive just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film if there is only one film you have to miss this is the onebr br robert is a teenager whose fathers died recently so he starts hanging out with some local antisocial teenagers and using drugs all these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodesbr br the first thing is that i dont think i can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film not in any single character if the director considers what i saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy i have to say that thats not even closebr br the use of cinematography is also not mature most of the time i couldnt see any facial expressions from the actors and i didnt feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings everybody happy except the audiencebr br the plot is particularly weak there are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together perhaps unless youre the one who wrote thembr br in the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking talking and moving so i really cant comment on acting herebr br nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though maybe this is the only good thingbr br i have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it at least you laugh when you watch scary movies this is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience hope you fall into neither group
