i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam jan 06 and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards many people reacted shocked and protesting he will get a lot of negative critics but the world is cruel like this and its not funny people dont like it that itself doesnt mean that the movie is bad i can see that difference dont shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our hubble nevertheless i think this a bad movie filmtechnically its a good one nice shots and script most good fitting music great actors the director pretends to make a psychological movie  the psychology however is of poor quality describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty the director pretends to describe that  but is not good in thatbr br the director used several times the word the selfishness of people mentioning for instance the teacher only this teacher wasnt selfish just someone in several roles caring for his pupils ánd worried about his script i think its a simplification to call him selfish the atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother made awful mistakes you terribly let me down but it doesnt become believable for me that there is caused súch a lot of pain that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things in fact reality is far more complex than the way this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions the interesting thing would be how does it work describe that process for me please so that we understandbr br with the written phrase on the end the director said to point to an alternative way of life it was the other extreme and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists promoting blackwhitethinking the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right there are enough blackwhitethinkers in the world causing lots of war and misery i hope this movie wont be successful
