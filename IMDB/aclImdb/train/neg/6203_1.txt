i saw this at the edinburgh film festival it was awful every clich√©d violent rich boy fantasy was on display you just knew how it was going to end especially with all the shots of the chefs wife and the rape of the first girlbr br the worst part was the qa with the directorwriter and writerproducer they tried to come across as intellectuals but you could tell theyre the types that get off on violence i bet anything they frequent brothels and do drugsbr br dont waste your time i had to keep my boyfriend from walking out of it
