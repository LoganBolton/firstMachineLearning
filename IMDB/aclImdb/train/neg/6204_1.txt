violence whether real or not always has an impact in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of but what was the point the violence looks like a mix of noÃ«s irreversible and  kubricks clockwork orangeboth of which are remarkable films dont get me wrong im not opposed to screen violence at all and ive seen some nasty stuff in my filmgoing years but this film as a whole is totally juvenile the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence the rizla paper thin reason we are give for roberts demise is his introduction to drugs danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for roberts drug fuelled demise however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes lesley manville is roberts unable to cope mum i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber the acting is wooden the scene in the kitchen with the tvcook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues some of the comments the boys makelooks like shes enjoying it are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clays ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the directors adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imageryone can only wonder at this young mans psychologybr br the political meaning of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes in the bar outside the tvcooks house war in iraq reports was perhaps too obvious in my opinion yes war is violent social determinism causes frustration were all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether youre in politics or on the street popping e juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man this issue is one that we still havent managed to grasp and certainly not in this filmbr br my opinion derivative badlymade and pointless
