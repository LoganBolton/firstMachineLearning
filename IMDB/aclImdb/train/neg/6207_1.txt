this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue for that matterbr br the main characters metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an overdragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve hisher goal at least in my opinionbr br to wrap it up shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead
