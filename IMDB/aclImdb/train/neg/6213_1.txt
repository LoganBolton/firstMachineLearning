this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible br br there wasnt a continuous minute where there wasnt a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them br br scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix br br examplesbr br the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader br br the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and waitit hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them upuh hellobr br and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrixor terminatorbr br there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazis nazis br br there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a childrens movie or an adult movie and wasnt much of either br br just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money
