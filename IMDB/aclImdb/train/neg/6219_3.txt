when the magic of lassie opened at radio city music hall i was foolish enough to believe it would be as heartwarming as some of the first lassie films were notbr br the story was abysmal the songs by the sherman brothers were way below their usual level the characters were uninspired and james stewart and mickey rooney had both seen much better daysbr br then too i was interested in seeing what alice fayes contribution would be like since shed been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so fetching in her earlier roles at fox alice too was letdown by the foolish script and the unflattering photography another disappointmentbr br nothing original here nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoyand clearly no magic present for anyone you can skip this one without missing a thing
