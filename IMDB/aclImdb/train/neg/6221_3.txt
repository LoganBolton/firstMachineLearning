first of all this movie isnt a complete disaster if you had never heard of the real story of gram parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion johnny knoxville cant really be criticised for his performance as phil kaufman  hes pretty good at looking laidback and down to earth and you can sort of root for his longsuffering everyman michael shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons except hes a hippy stoner there are some good individual comedic scenes  the hippyhearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out but thats where the good things end and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing the character of robert forster as grams actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film we all know his real father committed suicide when he was young  something that could surely be compared to grams life on the edge by a better filmmaker having forster as his supposed real father and not his stepfather would be bad enough if not for the well known difficulties gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body it has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing grams mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged gram when he later found out about it also the controversy over where grams body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent madeup father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse but then allows them to go ahead with the burning whatever the truth about the man who gram got the name parsons from he certainly bore no resemblance to forsters character here and it is hard to see why this role was written then theres the addition of christina applegate as a greedy chick yet very pretty of course who wants grams body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate her character and her acting are nonexistent and one wonders why the director didnt just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays kaufmans girlfriendit wouldnt have lowered the tone a whole lot more when you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about parsons the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent country music being changed by a young polite southern gentleman  who was also long haired drug loving popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like keith richards instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on kaufmans input into grams life kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did he certainly is a little cult from interviews it is obvious that hes delighted with the attention remember this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of gram parsons as he was preparing to set it alight what he did was not an act of great loyalty but a doped up alcoholic escapade looking at knoxville and the director in interviews a few things become clear also its obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of grams life nor do they wish to have they want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy it was an amazing life with a strange end that the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of gram parsons the makers had
