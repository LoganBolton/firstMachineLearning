im not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half but im afraid i just couldnt stand another minutebr br if this abject excuse for a film doesnt have the late great gp spinning like a wheel in his grave then i doubt anything willbr br the excellent review above not a film for parsons fans sums up most of my feelings how dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which theyre so clearly incapable of delivering what were they thinking where to startbr br the script i thought id be getting a slice of bittersweet americana what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no clich√© left unturned stupid hippy check stupid fat cop check awful plot contrivances check embarrassingly written female characters double check total disregard for the story which youre trying to portray checkbr br after a while you realize that what youre watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that scene with knoxville scene with ex girlfriend scene with knoxville which hasnt moved on much scene with ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one and so onbr br the direction my friends and i decided after some consideration that watching this was like watching a bad episode of quincy or maybe a particularly poor dukes of hazzard thats how bad the direction was terrible jump cuts awful camera work clunky ins and outs to scenes god it was cringeworthy and then i discovered the director was an irishman whos most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama called monarch of the glen trust me its lowest common denominator tv and then it all made sensebr br the acting are we now so critical that when some random guy from the tv decides to give acting a go if hes not so bad he stinks we applaud his efforts knoxville just about manages to get through every scene poor christina a has no such luck her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines i dont know the hippy in the hearse oh dear oh dear oh dear have we not moved on since cheech and chongbr br i could go on but i think you get my drift what i would say is that as other reviews have mentioned no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for the byrds the flying burrito brothers or grams solo work they knew nothing about the american road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology this film was shallow failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning tooh wait i didnt quite make the end and i suggest you stay away too
