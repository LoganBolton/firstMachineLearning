if youre a fan of the late gram parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you part comedy part road movie but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock historys oddest talesbr br spoilers br br basically the story concerns a wellknown roadie named phil kaufman played by johnny knoxville who supposedly made a pact with cult rockcountryfolk music hero gram parsons that stated when one of them died first it didnt matter which one it was that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert joshua tree national park in california to be exact and set the body ablazeso as to free the spirit and become one with the earth and so on sure to keep his word the barely sober kaufman with the assistance of a selfhating potheaded buddy jacks the body of the late parsons whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior from the airport and shortly after that what ensues is a cringeworthy combination of fiction and truth where the late parsons girlfriend kaufmans girlfriend parsons stonefaced father and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock so to speak in trying to catch kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch parsons body br br the films incompetent direction bad acting and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the titanic and not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place the accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies as far as ive heard them include number 1 parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriends and the chasing and whatnot number 2 kaufmans druggedout buddy was a known willing participant unlike what the movie attempts to portray in the disposing of parsons body and finally number 3 gram parsons reallife father died when he was just a boy and so it was parsons stepfather who could have honestly cared less about gram parsons when he was still alive in reallife that took care of the body after it was torched altogether though what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real phil kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story and yet still the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind frankly br br also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned its lead character played by the ultragrating johnny knoxville phil kaufman is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical braindead or seem utterly clueless as to what theyre actually doing there in the first place overall if you like johnny knoxville and or really dig the sobadtheyrenotevengood buddy flicks then i suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie but if youre like me and are a fan of the late gram parsons enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if theyre based on an actual reallife story and or you just like good films bethem road movies or fictional sliceoflife stuff you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise i obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place but since it was made i would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did unfortunately maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of gram parsons lifenot just what happened to his body after his spirit left it but until that time comes all we as an audience and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an allaround terrible memorial of sorts to the musical legacy that gram parsons was known to have left behind it should also be noted that they did actually use parsons music and a few others as well in the flick but not surprisingly though you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit turkeyzero stars
