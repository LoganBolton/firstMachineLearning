from the q  a before and after this is what i could gather some irish guy wants to make a movie nothing in particular just any movie so one night at a party he hears some exroadie tell him a classic bit of rock n roll lore the one about how gram parsons corpse was stolen from lax by his loyal roadie so he could honor parsons wishes that he be cremated out in joshuatree wowbr br what a great idea for a movie rock n roll well country grave robbing escapes friendship the 70s i guess we could get johnny knoxville from jackass cause its kind of a prank right and knoxville wants to do a movie too why he must have thought he had the next snatch on his handbr br but this storys not really that excitingwe need something for knoxville to struggle againstlike a psychotic girlfirend after his money but parsons was married at the time thats ok no one knows that besides we could get christina applegate but what if the audience doesnt like the idea of stealing a corpsewell well get his dad to join the chase but give permission in the end but parsons dad killed himself when he was 10 in fact his orphan status and tragic childhood are key parts of the parsons mythology mythology were making a movie this is creative problem solvingbr br its an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject applegates presence is doubling jarring first her invented character is a beverly hills bitch before her time she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand and secondly what kind of man would parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy facts arent just distorted or left out but reversed they could have easily found the villain they wanted in parsons stepfather who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritancebr br and the music oh the music i love the music is hacked up the bridge of a song here the chorus there forced to the background and in the end horribly covered by the hippest new indie band starsailor my girlfriend asked the unnecessary but irresistable question after the movie was anyone up there the writer the producers the director actually a gram parsons fan well no hed never actually heard of gram parsons but of course blah blah blah i learned to love it and heres some factoids i read in a bio online another guy vouched for parsons coolness by saying he and keith richards tripped on acid together and wrote wild horses together a mixed up bunch of facts as offbase as the movie another person asked wasnt it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film well he had the real roadies permission he was even set and the parsons estate gave permission and all these other people who got paychecks said it was greatbr br but what i really wondered was and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned parsons geek was if the movies so cheaply made a million had they not considered the original gram parsons fanbase as an audience the director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase though i doubt any mojo magazine reading countryrock 70s music fan would agree but a bunch of brits made it i guess and they just didnt care about cosmic american music or even knew it existed this isnt just not a truthful parsons flick its not even in the right spirit it doesnt even fit the legend at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs and plenty of people would love to be toldbr br i should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids just off the slopes and into johnny knoxville but if youre a parsons fan ignore the title its just a movie for jackass fans
