i cringed all the way through this movie first of all the idiotic plot has little to do with parsons own story hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie imagine englebert sings hendrixbr br do not take anything about this movie to be accurate the name parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the parsons legacy and his fan base grams father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with grams life or deathbr br if you are a gram fan i advise you to not see this movie i wish i hadnt its saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder id swear i could hear gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing if you are not familiar with grams life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of grambr br i cannot say enough bad things about this movie if gram were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself then again maybe hed be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result
