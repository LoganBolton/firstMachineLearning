this movie is incomprehendably bad it begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a trex that talks  to the audience it goes back and forth between sock puppetry and animation throughout probably because the film makers couldnt afford live actors ill spare you the long tiresome relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal 85 minutesbr br one of my friends found this very rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sells out of print bmovies and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it but as it turns out our intervention was not neecessary this film makes fun of itself better than we couldbr br i thought that ed woods plan 9 from outer space was the cheesiest movie in existence but leave it to japanamationlego carssock puppets to outdo him if you see this movie anywhere buy it without hesitation it is very rare and worth many many good laughs
