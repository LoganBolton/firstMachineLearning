first of all lets get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because theyre hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lotbr br moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like its going to be your usual bmovie down to the crappy fx but all a sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhillbr br the animation is very bad  cheap even worse than what i remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact its so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie i vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school  its the same kids over  over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue  voicesespecially the english dub that i viewed was horrid  i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes  comments like the robots  joelmike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie  survive it at the same timebr br heck im planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a bmovie night because its stupid pretty painful to watch  unintentionally hilarious at the same time im giving this movie a 310 an improvement from the 0510 i was originally going to give itbr br according to my grading scale 310 means pretty much both boring  bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15
