i was kinda interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick i was thoroughly disappointed it was the same kind of disappointment i felt watching friday the 13th jason takes manhattan so much potential wastedbr br the opening scene is a decent attention grabber then it grinds to a halt copious breasts and egregious 80s fashion cannot help this movie the only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha im not asking for cannibal holocaust level of gore but i was looking for cheap overthetop exploitative gore i got none of thatbr br i found a couple parts of the fight scenes somewhat intriguing hence the 2 stars i dont think its really worth the time it takes to watch it though i could see showing it at a party where nobody cares about what is going on and you just want something on in the background but i would not tell anyone oh dude you gotta see this movie it is neither good enough nor bad enough to warrant much attention
