scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers  fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing  general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesnt find much support at home since his mom is a slut  after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field  strangles the poor kid however something magical happens no the film doesnt suddenly become good lesters spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him  made his life hellbr br cowritten coproduced  directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr duforq although i dont remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of its terrible reputation  i have to say it pretty much well deserved since its terrible the script by itier bill cunningham  jason white uses the often told story of one of lifes losers who gets picked upon  tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick weve seen it all before weve seen killer scarecrows before weve seen faceless teens being killed off onebyone before weve seen one of lifes losers get his revenge before weve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before  weve seen incompetent small town sheriffs make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether its any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a resounding no to be honest the film has terrible characters awful dialogue an inconsistent  predictable story it has some cheesy oneliners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he asks can you dig it  the socalled twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isnt that exciting  the kills are forgettable you know im still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed  killed with a stick of cornbr br director itier doesnt do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means theres never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also im not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these backflips  somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix 1999 or some japanese kungfu flick to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good  he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad oneliners  twirl around a bit dont you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring i know hes a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day theres no nudity  the gore isnt anything to write home about theres a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in peoples heads someone has their heart ripped out  someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouthbr br with a supposed budget of about 250000 this was apparently shot in 8 days well at least they didnt waste any time on unimportant things like story  character development technically this is pretty much point shoot  hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played lesters mums bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig  fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film  the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous  dont get me started on his accentbr br scarecrow has a few fun moments  the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special makeup effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable  very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows 1988 not to be confused with the gene hackman  al pacino film scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels scarecrow slayer 2003  scarecrow gone wild 2004
