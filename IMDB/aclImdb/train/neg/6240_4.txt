a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this threadbr br i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsorybr br i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizingbr br the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good goingbr br and thats the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too greatbr br and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do rightbr br another interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people
