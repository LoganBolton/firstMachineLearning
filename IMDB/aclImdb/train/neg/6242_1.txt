lets be honest shall we al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus its a hook make no mistake al gore is a politician three years ago he was bustedticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid a yugo or even a gm metro but a lincoln go google it if you like or how about the fact that mr gore  his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuelguzzling jets to attend the premiers of an inconvenient truth so much for conservation huh al anyway it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at an inconvenient truth  discover the main fundamental flaw while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed global warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it for example i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot  they can point out an automobile which is not running right but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why generally not a second flaw just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago the toilet wasnt even invented yet what did they have a june bug in a match box hell even 5060 years ago therefore how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is getting warmer when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best or that man is the sole cause of it the answer is we dont  science is never a consensus thirty years ago time magazine did a cover proclaiming a new ice age the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions solar activity  el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed global warming finally what al gore fails to adequately address is even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al  implement everything he recommends how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we cant even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism answer its wishful thinking mr gore  you being a former vp of the usa know it if the folks who produced an inconvenient truth were really honest they would have titled their film al gore wants attention but what id really like is for someone to ask the former vp this why were two of the planets biggest polluters aka china  india exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords anyway i hear the producers of ait are working on their next film entitled gnomes fairies  elves our endangered friends
