something very strange happens when you talk about global warming science goes out the window and belief and consensus becomes the topic of discussionbr br its because of that fact that i give a failing mark to al gores documentarybr br instead of promoting intelligent discussion he kept the debate at the level of belief and consensusbr br of course when youre trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to stop global warming you may thing its a problem to tell the scientific truth we dont know how much of the current warming was caused by humans maybe none of it maybe some of it or maybe it has overceded the next ice age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planetbr br but the fact remains that we dont knowbr br so were asked to believe in the consensus never mind that any scientist that strays from the consensus is ostracized never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus einstein didnt believe in the consensus neither did copernicus or galileobr br so why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions if global warming is so incontrovertible surely a few people testing that theory cant be so threateningbr br what is going on here thats the movie i was hoping al gore would have made istead he chose to shore up his support with the true believers of the consensusbr br sad really
