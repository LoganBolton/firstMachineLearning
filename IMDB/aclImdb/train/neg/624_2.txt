the director states in the behindthescenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sht for mothers day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also dont cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood 18 year old recluse thats right hes been in high school for 22 years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn haha get it and his girlfriend just goes ohmy god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing flips off cars and calling people losersbr br the movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesntbr br if you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude
