i really did like this show once upon a time that is until i realized all the faults in it its so unrealistic i know its fiction but it isnt even the slightest bit believable heres why spoilers ahead folks are we really supposed to believe that a kid like yugi would be descended from a pharaoh of ancient egypt cmon hes the biggest nerd on the face of the earth and whats up with the pharaoh aka atem andor yamis hair last i checked pharaohs were shaved except for a small bit of hair atop the head and wore fancy hatsbr br and are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius named seto kaiba can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like domino high puhleeze first off hed have to legally be an adult to run a company and that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius since hed be the only adult in his class and second off why would he attend a school like domino high when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy snobbish academy plus the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame every time you turn around that kids been kidnapped by goons for the baddie yawn nothing new nothing newbr br joey is the poor kid who lives with a goodfornothing father it says that joey earns all the money to attend his school because his fathers an alcoholic but you never once see joey do anything that resembles work he doesnt even mention work and his sister serenity is a complete moron why would she choose a snob like duke who dressed her brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television over a nice guy like tristan is she really that clueless various characters throughout the show get possessed by demonic forces get their souls stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to mental illness oh thats childsafe not tea is the typical girlnextdoor type whose only purpose is to be yugiyamis girlfriend and while she has some cool points to her she just doesnt have enough time to shine as a main characterbr br the animation is simply awful all the characters look sickly and anorexic the perspectives are terrible especially when they do closeups of somebodys hand and the colors look good but not stellarbr br but the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that yami says that his millennium puzzle can send souls back to their bodies if this was so how come he didnt save yugis grandpa in the first place when pegasus stole his soul and save himself the trouble of getting it backbr br all it really is is a commercial for itself the only plus side to it is yugioh the abridged series by littlekuribohbr br please do something more worthwhile like watch the abridged versionbr br 110
