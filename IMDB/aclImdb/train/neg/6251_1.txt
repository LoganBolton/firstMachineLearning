i was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this lowbudget movie the most glaring absurdity was that while the american inmates in a north korean pow camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine going without bathing shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas and sleeping on bare floors and  lets not forget enduring torture  they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair with the exception of a suitably austerelooking harry morgan as an army major the casting and acting are simply awful ronald regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles a mostly caucasian cast portraying the north korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly russian officers acting as advisors to the koreans strut around wearing rebadged nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots obvious costumedepartment recycles from wwii flicks and speaking with accents like general burkhalter from hogans heroes well thats just six kinds of silly dont waste your time on this one
