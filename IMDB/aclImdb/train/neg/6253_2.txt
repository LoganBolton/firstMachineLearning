not a very good movie but according to the info its pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the nk pow camps and thats done effectively enough with surprising frankness for the time whatever technical flaws exist and there are plenty by watching this youll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff  again nasty because its being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo baybr br i dont think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office and if you watch the movies like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films i dont know if it was the people in 54 being trapped in the wwii concepts the boys tend to wisecrack a lot or the war or what but its interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like go tell the spartans
