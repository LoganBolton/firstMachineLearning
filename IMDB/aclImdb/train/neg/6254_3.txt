a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent a nonspeaking part as i recall he brought it over on dvd so i could see it it was interesting but very much felt like an amateur film a well made amateur film though really boring and poorly written it was probably fun to make and be involved in but it definitely didnt deserve any kind of wide release maybe in omaha theyd enjoy it but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friends involvementbr br if this film maker has made or makes any more films he really should try to have a really interesting story line and good actors im sure this was a great learning tool for them i wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their film making
