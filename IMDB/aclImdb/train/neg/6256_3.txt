hmm i agree with the reviewer who said that strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film i thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it i think that was primarily because of marsden and speedman  not the plotbr br the bottom line is that this film is mildly psychologically tantalizing on the one hand and profoundly homophobic on the other thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter im not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propagandabr br i thought the acting was mediocre a lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees askew of reality i kept wanting to derive some meaning from the plot but its ultimately just a conversation with a mad man speedman i feel mildly sorry for him speedman because of his loss but not really his loss is no greater and certainly is less than losses suffered every day around the world by more significant causesbr br does the film expose naiveté about hivaids yes that of the intended audience is hiv a dark mysterious evil killer what about its victims the answer to both questions is no neither hiv nor its victims have any more or less malevolent intent than lupus multiple sclerosis tb hepatitis cancer or their victims for gods sake just because a disease is communicable does not make it either deliberate or negligent  or evil  it just isbr br does this excuse ignorance or foolhardy risk taking  no should all people practice safe sex  yes will safe sex save the world  no is safe sex realistic in all instances of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings  of course not what kind of a world would we live in if everyone followed the rules no one ever took risks and sex was never spontaneous and passionate am i ignoring that the film deals specifically with gay sex  yes hiv is spread by sharing blood or bodily fluids between infected and noninfected individuals sex is not necessary for transmission gay or otherwisebr br im always disturbed by willful violence of one person upon another i actually thought the film did do a good job of portraying the absurdity of toms violent abduction captivity and intent towards dan and this kind of insane violence does occur every daybr br stream of consciousness notes from the film tom is crazybr br why doesnt dan ask why do you feel this way rather than what are you doing implication men who have sex with men get aids implication hiv  aids where was toms responsibility in the sex act why was it dans responsibility to use the condom maybe you slipped it off before you stuck it in what are we talking about here was one of the parties unconscious maybe she didnt want to hear the truth are you kidding me shes up in heaven and so unbelievably hurt about what she now knows about me right is dans life over if he has hiv certainly not is this why the whole world is so homophobic they think gay men are the cause of hiv that they will give it to the rest of the world and we will all die are you kidding me are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause is the problem do we feel that way about the victims of tuberculosis of malaria i can see that tom is hurt because of his wifes death and he blames it on aids but seriously whos at fault here the victim or the virus are illnesses really the responsibility of the ill presuming they did not seek and did not seek to spread the diseasebr br sure safe sex is essential to a safe life but so is notdriving notflying notleaving the house notliving do we really want to blame the disease on the victims would safe sex between tom and dan have prevented toms wifes ultimate demise perhaps but not dans sole responsibilitybr br tom is crazy did i mention thatbr br tom to dan maybe you get what you deserve come on 24 days violent naïve and homophobicbr br am i overreacting perhaps but i think this film points a judging finger at gay men for their reckless and malevolent intent towards a straight world by practicing unsafe sex when the rate of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionately equivalent or better than that of heterosexuals we all need to wake up and get serious about hivaids hiv is killing hundreds of thousands of straight africans every year
