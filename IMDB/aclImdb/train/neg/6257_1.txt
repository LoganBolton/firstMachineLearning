spoilers strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film allow me to add balance by pointing out the followingbr br script dreadful as tom and dan are getting to know each other bantering about films the talk is clearly that of one person and i suspect it was the director who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent at one point dan asks have you heard of the hiv virus and it sounds about as natural as asking have you communicated with the nine alien racesbr br acting white teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make speedman did well enough with what he was given i suppose but marsden was terrible  unsympathetic unbelievable and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity there is an emptiness to his performances also see interstate 60br br plot spare me the moments of halfescape were not thrilling but irritating and weak recall marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down they dont work man teehee and beware the semi blackandwhite flashbacks which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from csi and other crime dramas br br most important of all most dangerous evil and offensive is the homophobia external or internal you decide in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon tom says that dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all  excuse me where was tom while they were having sex there is some villainizing of the inserting partner which comes off as a villainizing of the gay man in generalbr br in sum beware
