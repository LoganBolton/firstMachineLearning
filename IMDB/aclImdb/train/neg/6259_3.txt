well maybe the pc version of this game was impressive maybe i just finished playing the ps2 version and its pretty much a complete messbr br there are a couple elements that are okay or promising ill mention those first because it will be over quickly first the idea of a historical gtalike game is a great one the game gun was a historical gtalike game and unlike mafia gun was excellent id love to see a game set during mafias era done right next the storyline is well written the story makes sense it has dramatic arcs it uses an unusual device with much of the game being a backstory and its interesting finally some of the graphicsespecially those used during cutscenesare impressive mafias designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where gta skimped on that effort especially the characters unfortunately in many other areas the graphics kinda stink and id much rather have excellent gameplay than impressivelooking charactersbr br the gameplay is what sinks this title so low first off the controls and camera absolutely suck that has to be the first focus of any game developers you cant release a game where the controls andor camera suck number one theres no reason that the players character tom cant have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick unless its absolutely necessary and it hardly ever is i hate the setup where the left stick moves the character in a strafing way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick here its not only unnecessary it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge for example tom has to climb on a couple missions but the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera and then press l1 every time you need to climb or tom will descend insteadbr br next ive never seen a worse fighting system the first problem is that you cant autoaim or lock on to any targets at one early point the game seems to tell you that you can use l2 or r2 to lock on to targets but that never worked so to focus on any enemy you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the characters orientation and the camera which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make tom disappear all the time by that time youre probably getting pummeled or shot to deathbr br next if youre touching or almost touching an enemyand thats certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons the fighting systemwhich primarily consists of tapping or holding r1 is completely useless enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug but you just cant move unless you back off so close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick yelling at the character to move away which it wont do 50 of the time then tapping r1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes r1 useless and if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime youre also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything by that time youre probably getting pummeled or shot again and your only option will be to try to move the character away again my fights often consisted of making tom run circles around an area like a comedy film hoping that i could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the ais mercy again so much for realistic fightingbr br and the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns if youre touching someone half the time the controller just wont allow you to fire off a shot yet they can still riddle you full of holes additionally theres no autoaim and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive even with the sensitivity set to zero under options gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you luckily or not damage seems to be recorded almost randomly it can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character and theres no rhyme or reason to it you can put five shots into an enemys head and near point blank range and theyll still return fire and hurt you yet the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system so after shots with powerful enough guns your aim will float off target and youll have to fight with it againbr br as for the celebrated graphics except for the characters and textures that youre close to theyre actually pretty disappointing the distance always seems mostly empty and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when youre driving the city wasnt very well designed its not varied enough and there arent many interesting things to see or do the cars seem slow and theyre difficult to control they also all drive about the same some have mentioned the music but that was also pretty nondescript a much better job could have been done on that end also as many others have mentioned the load times are ridiculous and constant they tend to be over a minute long and they occur between and in the middle of everythingeven racesbr br overall the mafia port to ps2 at least seems to have been very rushed the game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job
