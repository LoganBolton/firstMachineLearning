nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be in the movies they are prepared to do almost anythingbr br im not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash after all the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of noim talking about those who are more than willing to costar with a badly made handpuppet called george now that is embarrassingbr br a bioelectronic being created by brilliant scientist edward brake wellington meffert george who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball that when ingested can reverse character disordersbr br edwards personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects fearing that there may still be side effects his evil assistant julie debbie laster however has no such qualms and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs inevitably they all turn into hideous killer mutantsbr br with bargain basement special effects a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow i took notes as i watched the film and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several softcore sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescuebr br this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie tony bruce morton a walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison
