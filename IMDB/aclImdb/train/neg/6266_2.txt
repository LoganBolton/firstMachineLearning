it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays its like all you need is a camera a group of people to be your cast and crew a script and a little money and walla you have a movie problem is that talent isnt always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds the video store shelves are filled with these so called films these arent even guilty pleasures theyre just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema but most of their films are b movie gold however some of the films theyve put out they had nothing to do with making and some like nightmare weekend didnt deserve any form of release at all br br pros the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material some unintentional hilarity moves at a good pace should at 81 minutesbr br cons awful writing which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes poorly lit especially the night scenes and the ending which you cant make out at all doesnt make a lick of sense badly scored cheap and very dated effects total lack of character development and you wont care about anybody this is supposed to be a horror film but its lacking in that area and isnt the least bit scary nothing interesting or exciting happens loaded with unnecessary paddingbr br final thoughts i never expected this to be some forgotten gem but i never imagined it would be this bad i dont know if its the worst film ever made but its a definite contender troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release dont make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of youbr br my rating 15
