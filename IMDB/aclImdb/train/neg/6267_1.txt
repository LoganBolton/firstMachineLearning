the acting in this movie stinks the plot makes very little sense but from what i gathered its supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn peoples personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies or blow their heads up whichever and the effects are lousy too most of the movie consists of bad music with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes this should be one of the worst things ever made but for one thing one element of shear brilliance that makes nightmare weekend stand above all others and that special quality is the presence of georgebr br george is the lovable interface device between the scientists daughter jessica and the home computer security system with his green hair and nose balding scalp and heartshaped mouth george is the guardian angelconfidant to jessica who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid with his monotone synthesized voice george tells jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses and also that hitchhiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars of course little jessica just cant seem to stay out of trouble causing george to execute emergency program code protection jessica which results in the violent death of jessicas wouldbe assailant via one of the aforementioned steel ballsbr br kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light hal should have been represented by our friend george in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise the light and sound show at the end of close encounters not bad but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been george the hand puppet bishop data r2  kitchen appliances next to the almighty george he might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90 but dont be fooled this show is all about george with even that limited amount of screentime george joins the ranks of such luminous film characters as hollywood montrose majai and pappy from new moon rising as icons of american cinema george to apache  you are my hero
