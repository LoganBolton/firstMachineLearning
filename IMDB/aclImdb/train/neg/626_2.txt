spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyonebr br this movie really annoyed me it has a great looking monster has some good low budget effects some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvdbr br the problems with this movie are many first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school you dont believe anything from the get go as a result the scarecrow while looking great isnt much beyond that he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary is this a comedy or a horror movie its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up it seems more send up of every clich√© than heartfelt horror film i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace itbr br despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks youre paying too muchbr br avoid
