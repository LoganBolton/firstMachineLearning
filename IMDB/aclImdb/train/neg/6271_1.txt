there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is it simply defies description something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims mouth which kills them or turns them into zombies the whole thing is so wonky that its stunning theres also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet im not making this stuff up the computer also controls things like cars even though theres nothing linking the computer with the vehiclebr br the film is total trash surreal bad trash spectacularly oneofakind bad trash theres a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there which arent very hot or erotic theres even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula which had me rolling on the floorbr br definitely one of the worst movies ever made up there with the equally wretched directtohome video boardinghouse or boogeyman ii both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush at least its fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on
