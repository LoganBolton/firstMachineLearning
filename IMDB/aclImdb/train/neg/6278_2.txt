you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot br br and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into yet again which on its own would be depressing but here its overkill the idea that its not a medical condition not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug some doppelgangers have super powers but others dont or dont know they do it seems theyre just as clueless as we arebr br its a poor mans ripoff of invasion of the bodysnatchers with keifer sutherlands mirror and the sixth sense were you to seriously botch those three together
