nobr br basically your watching something that doesnt make sense to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the storybr br a normal everyday to day women is walking down a street then finds herself driving by in her own car she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her familybr br i specifically made an account to comment on this film of how horribly written this was the acting was great the events were great but the story just brought it nowhere  it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic im not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothingbr br spoiler startsbr br they had this area between 2 dimensions ours and behind the glass that would come into our world and kill us it was not elaborated on all during the film and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened nothing gets explained during the film the main character shouldnt of even been the main character at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away her sisters boyfriend should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after br br i bought this movie for 10 threw it out right after dont waste your time i really hope nothing like this is made again
