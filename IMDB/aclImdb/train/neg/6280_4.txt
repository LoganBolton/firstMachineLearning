have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert yeah imagine stretching that image to a whole movie you pretty much got the idea of broken though theres no detectives in this movie im just using it as a visual example but the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99 of the screen time i got nothing to complain about that woman shes a perfect choice for this rolebr br i consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and i can truly enjoy some really moody stuff it would be really cool if i can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall lets be honest here the acting is superb some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watchingbr br now onto the problem of this movie beyond the mood theres not much anything else here the director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth i dont consider it to be a spoiler if i say the obsession is mirror lets face it this singular idea is all over the bloody place and thats all the director got to work with granted there are a few twist and turn here and there if you paid any attention nothing is going to surprise you in the end obvious plot holes asidebr br now im not picking bones with this style of art since i enjoyed them most of the time i still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express movie is not a piece of music or a picture or a painting or even a poem and certainly not just a cool image in your mind its all that plus a good story and character development i consider the lynch style of movie making cheating it is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium we gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason therefore we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a paintingbr br this movie is not completely lynch style thank goodness it has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion it does not have much story or character development it presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface it does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it the oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental maybe the coherency remains in directors head but from what i can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screenbr br where did he put his effort in then it seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music the music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materializedbr br in the end i felt like ok i know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension it is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have and we are given very little about who the characters are all we have is this circumstance that just took placed disappointing but i guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows
