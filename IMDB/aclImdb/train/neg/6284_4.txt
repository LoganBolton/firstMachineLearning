i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows whats going to happen within the first 2030 minutes  the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybodybr br there is no real twist which is fine  but the final reveal doesnt make a great deal of sense either how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film if shes an evil id from beyond the mirrorbr br admittedly the scenes beyond the mirror were chilling when they first appeared and the blondes murder is also effectively creepy but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 8090 minutes does not really cut it in fact it gets quite dull
