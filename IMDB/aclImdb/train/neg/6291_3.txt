now i recently had the viewing pleasure to watch the hilarious comedy bachelor party one of my new favorite comedies laughed until it just hurt type of movies so i naturally wanted to see the sequel hoping it would have the same laughs but instead bachelor party 2 the last temptation is made by the american pie generation where its tasteless and defeats the hole purpose of the first film yeah the first film has nudity but it doesnt show in every single scene also the plot is exactly the same from the first its not always a complaint with me but this could have been a little more original the only thing is that im glad that at least no old actors from the original appear in this movie because it would have been cheesy or really silly lookingbr br ron and melinda are engaged after only 2 months of dating everyone is against it melinda has a rich family but theyre pretty happy with ron and melindas brother todd is scared that ron will take his job so they go out on a weekend to miami for a bachelor party and todd is going to make sure that hell trap ron into a picture that will make melinda change her mind about the marriagebr br bachelor party 2 the last temptation has a couple laughs here and there but over all fails to deliver what the first film accomplished these guys rons friends were more obnoxious than likable except for seth he was kinda funny the only likable characters other than seth is ron and melinda everyone else just more or less gets on your nerves you wanna watch this film just watch girls gone wild its the same thing only it doesnt try to pretend that its a film stick to the original bachelor party thats the movie thats going to get you in tears of laughterbr br 310
