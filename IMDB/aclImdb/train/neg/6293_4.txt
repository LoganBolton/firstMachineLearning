i had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and i have to say i thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hanks which i thought was pretty goodi was rightin all honesty i thought it could have been bettersure there were some funny moments but it just didnt seem to hit the mark with methe acting was ok and the storyline pretty well follows the original but i think it could have been so much betterthis movie id say is for teens and the young of heart full of female bodies alcohol and sexits just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again 410 is my vote for this one
