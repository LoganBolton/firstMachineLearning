this film looked interesting id read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightlybr br started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations in fact i didnt bother watching the whole thing utter drivel  bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters  that was the point of the film i guessbr br watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekendbr br do not bother with this feature
