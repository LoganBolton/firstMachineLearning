swing is an important film because its one of the remaining blackproduced and acted films from the 1930s many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable but this one is in fairly good shape its also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton cluba time all but forgotten todaybr br unfortunately while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances its also a mess the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the eraincluding a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day however the writing is just godawful and a bit trashy at timesand projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning this is because before the plot really gets going you are treated to a noaccount bum who lives off his hard working wife a popular stereotype of the time and when he is caught with a hussy who by the way totally overplays this role they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown and the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razora trashy scene indeed later in the film when the prima donna is behaving abominably her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him it seems like the film at times wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they cant even do this wellwith some of the worst acting ive seen in a very long timebr br still if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way with trashy characters bad acting and direction and poor writing this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancingas well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture just dont say i didnt warn you about the actingits really really bad
