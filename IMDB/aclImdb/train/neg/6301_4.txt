in spite of sterling work by the supporting actors and an intelligent script by alan plater this film suffers from a fatal flaw  the lack of charm of the central characteractor one of the characters describes richard e grants character as a whining little turd and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly there is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upperclass publisherfriend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him he is rude arrogant selfish selfdestructive and thoroughly annoying the part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate  a ewan mcgregor for examplebr br all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance all i wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself
