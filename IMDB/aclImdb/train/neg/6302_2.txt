the british heritage film industry is out of control theres nothing wrong with filming classic novels but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies this film rips the guts out of orwells tough novel turning it into a harmless fluffy romantic comedy aspidistra may not be orwells best work but noone who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger but the humiliation of being poor in the novel london is a bleak grey cold heartless city and comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers but this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s london in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight and even the slums of lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes comstocks poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbishstrewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolatebox world worst of all is the scripts relentless bonhomie ancient jokes and clunking dialogue its so frustrating because richard e grant is the perfect person to play gordon comstock and the film is packed with great actors but its all for nothing this film made me so angry britains literary history is something to be proud of for its richness complexity and power and what do we do with it we employ bland nobodies to turn it into softcentred anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are getting some culture while they drink their horlicks and quietly doze off
