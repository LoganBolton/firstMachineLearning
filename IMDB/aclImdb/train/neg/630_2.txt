this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a bmovie course there are inherent constrictions in a bmovie budgets are tight time is precious scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days and the actors are often green and inexperienced the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you scarecrows script seems to have been written in a drunken haze i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie but ill just mention one the gravedigger the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie he is shown with his daughter who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count why give the gravedigger a daughter why give the daughter a boyfriend why introduce them so late in the movie why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline scarecrow doesnt seem to carebr br the story of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid played by and actor whod id peg to be in his early 30s who is picked on by the other kids he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy his mom is a lush and the town whore one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings by calling him a faggot for drawing birds instead of monsters and cowboys if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys id think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows and later kills lester in a cornfield under the titular scarecrow magically lesters soul goes into the scarecrow somehow this transference changes lesters soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kungfu scarecrow i disagree the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him those who smoke pot in the corn field those who dig graves boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie setbr br the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned the director a frenchman does an impromptu version of rap music admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by and im paraphrasing life ez a bitch but et has a great assbr br number of beers i drank while watching this movie 5 did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level
