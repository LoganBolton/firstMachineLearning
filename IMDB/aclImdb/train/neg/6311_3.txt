its a bad very bad moviebr br well for people a real realistic movie is a good thing for me it is not life is also predictable bad nasty trivial senseless sometimes maybe thats the reason for people say that this film is realbr br too many common places youre black youre a criminal youre doomed and cursed whatever you do youll end up by shooting or being shot by someone dont let the kids play with the weapons it could be dangerous and then there are those who go to the church and then they are good very goodbr br before this one i hadnt seen such a bad movie thats perhaps the reason for i never noticed how important the photography itself is important in a movie in this one every scene shot in daytime outdoor is clearly and annoyingly blue they didnt even care to correct the colour balance oh ive rated more than 300 movies in this database so far and this 310 is my lowest ever
