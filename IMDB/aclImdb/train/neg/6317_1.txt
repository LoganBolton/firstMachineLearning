ive no idea what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money  nowbr br yeah this is a plausible story if you regard the alien abduction sequence in life of brian as plausiblebr br this film is little more than a leftist pipedream had the us and ussr give up nuclear weapons the result wouldve been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war bad as korea vietnam and other wars of the era were they were proxy wars fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagementbr br this film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation as if someone would say mr president some kids at drastic high are not eating and ronald reagan would reply my god id better revise my defense policy rightbr br like this film wouldnt it be better if the soviet union wouldve collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build wait that happened
