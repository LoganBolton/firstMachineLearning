i cant imagine anyone would ever in a million years want to watch this movie not because it was one of the worst ever made it wasnt but largely because its about 20 years old and ohsoout of the mainstream i was trying to find out where i saw an actor before and this popped up so yeah a kid stops playing little league because he doesnt like nukes this prompts major media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war the end a fantasy to be sure but one so cockeyed it would make john lennon blush since terrorism has replaced communism as the ism that scares the hell out of us this movie really has no relevance except as an innaccurate look back at those times the writing acting and film craft are similarly undeveloped the reason i rated it as highly as i did was because i watched this movie around 50 times while i was 56 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it but i now realize that it doesnt quite cut mustard so if the law of large numbers holds true and someone eventually does decide to check out this movie realize that there are much better ways to spend your time but also much worse ones i will refrain from a john q tirade for now
