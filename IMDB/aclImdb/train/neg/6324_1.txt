i spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80s and 90s this was by far the worst film i ever showed to the public one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great inspiring film even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre jamie lee curtis in an early nonhorror film role demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act shes still trying but it isnt getting much betterbr br im sorry and heres the spoiler international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreckbr br this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv it is not worth the price of a movie rental your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked because it can only be better than this
