one of the five worst movies i have ever watched and im not exaggerating in fact i recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching showgirlsbr br out of 400 votes the movie gets a user rating of 5310 but there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 1010 probably due to the message of the movie  nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind chuck murdock is an allstar little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons soon amazing grace smith is an allstar boston celtic who is inspired by chucks story and gives up basketball soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a worldwide protest later all the children of the world go on a silence strike this inspires the president of the united states to meet with the soviet premier who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next little league season the movie ends with chuck about to throw out the first pitch with the president telling his new best friend chuck not to worry about striking out every batter as he hasnt thrown a baseball in a yearbr br somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills amazing grace when the president finds out he is told that the fbi can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it so the president calls the underworld boss but its one am i dont care get him on the line and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has and to not get out of line againbr br honestly this movie was so crappy that i couldnt turn it off it was on television from 230 am to 400 am and i watched it all i wasnt turned off by the antinuclear weapons propaganda i was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports i dont even understand why amazing grace smith was killed and with all these famous athletes becoming chucks friends why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand and there was the clich√© moment near the end when dad tells chuck i never told you this but im proud of you cue hug
