why does this movie fall well below standards ultimately the answer lies in the poor humourless script a slimaverage looking travolta looking rather dapper in black i must say even with a huge mullet and gross both act very well as two youngish slickdressed but nevertheless dimwitted new yorkers eager to open their own nightclub other than that the rest of the film is just boring to watch it is so dull that its really not worth knowing what happens in the films climax on any level kelly preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husbandtobe travolta is one of the films few pleasures charles martin smith is quite fun to watch as struggling kgb honcho bob smith personally i think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from ny to indian springs nebraska which is in the former soviet unionyoull understand if you see the movie apparently this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release i guess paramount stalled on releasing the movie until january 1989 because of the unbelievable plot it was reported they deemed it unreleasable nevertheless this 6000000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing 163000 in revenue as it was released only briefly in places like texas and colorado before heading straighttovideo this is testament to the overall bad quality of this movie
