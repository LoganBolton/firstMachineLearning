well what was fun except for the fun partbr br its my second least favorite so far i even thought it was worse than lazarus and ghost in the machinebr br lets start with the good the teaser it was incredibly well done and also emotional being the great animal lover that i am it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episodebr br but then theres all the bad and believe me there is a lot of it little made sense so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated whaaa the dialog was also pretty awful there were about one or two quotable lines br br and worst of all having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me in the end whats the point they all pretty much died we didnt learn anything we werent entertained and i couldnt even find sophias death sad just very frustratingbr br  star shame because season 2 was doing so well
