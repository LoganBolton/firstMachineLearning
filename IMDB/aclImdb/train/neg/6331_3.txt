mr mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time so i was interested to see what hed do with total creative control over a movie sadly it is unwatchable though not because the jokes arent funnysome i wont say most of them are and in fact mr mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags the trouble is that the technical quality sets lighting sound editing you name it is so godawful the movie is intolerable some outfit called pko productions gets the producing credit but it doesnt look produced at all it looks more like mike stole one of the cameras from the snl set and made the whole thing in an afternoon i realize mikes goal was to torture the audience but even that deserves some basic standards such as the ability to actually see hear or comprehend whatever it is thats supposed to be shocking still the dvd isnt a total waste it includes a eulogy for odonoghue by bill murray and three mr mikes least loved bedtime stories from snl plus the cat swimming section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out 310
