i actually saw this movie at a theater as soon as i handed the cashier my money she said two words i had never heard at a theater before or since no refunds as soon as i heard those words i should have just waved byebye to my cash and gone home but no foolishly i went in and watched the movie this movie didnt make anyone in the theater laugh not even once not even inadvertantly mostly we sat there in stunned silence every ten minutes or so someone would yell this movie sucks the audience would applaud enthusiastically then sit there in stunned bored silence for another ten minutes
