all of david priors movies are terrible on all counts bad writing bad acting bad cinematography no budget the directors brother is usually cast as the male lead but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity the plot of almost every david prior film as i like to refer to them is basically the same manly allamerican commandos team up to blow up communist baddies but unlike other cold warera garbage such as red dawn priors movies are actually funny because of their overthetop premises and acting the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which becker or was is the other dude is being summoned by general mitchell for a topsecret mission in south america the funniest line in the movie is then delivered something to the effect of this is my roommate i trained him well what you trained your roommate and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding evictionbr br if you can find these gems on video used anywhere buy them they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst3kstyle experience so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and aerobicide aka killer workout but the one i recommend the most over them all is final sanction with the freakishlooking robert zdar
