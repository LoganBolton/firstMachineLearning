east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective with frank sinatra in the role of the cop and william windom is the boy its a progressive film for china i guess but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy he cruises the park without fearhe hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer and that in fact happens then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture made to squat for a period of time handcuffed slapped this is what the gay man wants and implicitly the gay man is challenging the cops selfimage as a manly man the storys about the gay mans life which include flashbacks are tolerable but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works the movie becomes unbearable it becomes a cry of pity for chinas gays who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society sorry i cant relate
