i picked this up at the video store because of tarantinos recommendation if you dont like this go f yourself on the box seemed like a ringing endorsement i was expecting something a bit more like death proof not much actual violence in this one tho or plot of character or dialogue br br look at the poster its all there stunts and rock it goes back and forth a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show at a level that youd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet they work they meet girls they party end of storybr br the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly secondtier and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling  that aussie fellow really is something and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the art i hung it there to see what crazy thing hed do next just wish he could have found a better vehicle
