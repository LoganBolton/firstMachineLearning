perhaps im not a sophisticate this and closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films ive seen recently and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent the dialogue is false false false nothing that comes out of anyones mouth seems remotely believable perhaps the way this film is set up thats the way its supposed to feel but it was unwatchable and boring i walked out after 20 minutes of tediumbr br ill stick with sleeper and bananas for my woody allen fix if i ever come across this on the teevee ill turn over and try to find an episode of quincy instead
