well im blowed a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour im aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which ive seen less than half but i hope youll understand why basically it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters with the exception of chloe sevigny and were badly directed into doing so and a camera that sat around portentously only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it drama none its partially prenarrated but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situationbr br maybe i did leave too early in this case but by then id decided against another hour and a half of onelinerallen clones the script has its funny moments  i went almost entirely on the back of will ferrells excerpts in the trailer trailerhooked again doh  but theres little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly as is best worse than this theres no fluidity saying this films wooden makes a forest look like a jelly the opening cafébound discussion being the most abject caseinpoint the only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing  210
