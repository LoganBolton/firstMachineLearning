this movie stinks you will want back the twoplus hours it takes to get through it sliding doors w gwyenth paltrow and directed by peter howit did what melinda  melinda tries to do much much much better that movie was clever witty and wellacted i cared about what happened to both gwyenths  or rather the characters she played  and the performances by supporting cast were fantasticbr br where as melinda  melinda is tiresome the dialogue is contrived and i could have cared less about any of these people  least of all melinda one melinda is so dysfunctional  her first glass of wine is at 10 am  and so melodramatic she is laughable and not in the comedic sense the 2nd melinda is fine but forgettablebr br woody allens previous ensemble movies worked because im guessing he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented one piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months you can tell and while chloe sevigny is talented  those around her are not not enough to be a whole presence the movie ends up being chloe sevigny and a bunch of other people you know youve seen in other movies but cant quite remember which onesbr br sad very sad
