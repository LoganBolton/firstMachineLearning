ive seen my share of woody allens movies and while theyre not always great you can usually be sure youre going to be entertained probably the last really good ones were bullets over broadway 94 and mighty aphrodite 95  since then the ones ive seen have been patchy but watchable and so when i was invited to see the new woody allen movie melinda and melinda which i wasnt even aware had been released yet i went along happily i hadnt really heard much about it so i hoped i would be pleasantly surprisedbr br what i got was definitely the worst woody allen movie ive seen the premise is overexplained the cast is terrible the script is slow and lifeless too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out i assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short filmbr br i dont mind the concept behind this film  two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy and obviously the film proceeds to show us that by playing out both scenarios the problem is neither of these two films are any good at all the comedy isnt funny and the tragedy isnt very tragic it seems like allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam or time to actually complete the filmbr br the general level of acting is notably bad also  will ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table and its basically a woody allen impression previously good actors like chloe sevigny just come off as annoying and the worst of the bunch is radha mitchell as melinda which is a shame because her character is in nearly every scenebr br to be fair to the actors the script they are working with is lacking if not nonexistent definitely a long way from the allen we know and love from classics like manhattan or annie hall
