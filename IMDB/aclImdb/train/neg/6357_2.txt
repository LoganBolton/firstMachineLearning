i am so disappointed this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again the neurotic upperclass manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses woody ive seen these characters already ive seen the storyline from you ten times already where did your creativity go you need to open your eyes and look around you the world has changed dramatically since annie hall  and you need to change along with itbr br there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism  why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over againbr br when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out it does nothing for me  because now ive come to expect his old standby the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating depressing and same old same oldbr br if woody wants to win his fans back then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated  not insulted
