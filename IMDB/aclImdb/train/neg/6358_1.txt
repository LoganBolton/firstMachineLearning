and how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic compulsive ubernew yorker persona in this film woody is played by will ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation than the one kenneth branagh did in celebrity its an annoyingly repetitive story now nebbishy neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great manhattan neighborhoods everyone constantly patronizes expensive exclusive restaurants during which all the characters relate fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy there is always a trip to the hamptons during which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases and then of course said main character feels guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway sometimes succeeding sometimes failing etcbr br this a tired formula and proof that allen isnt really a great film artist at all he just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20yearold who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and again
