may i please have my 1300 back i would have rather watched hydro electric power comes to north america again this is a movie with one voice the same voice which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least 150 an hour and i dont take insurance it was eerie watching will ferrell morph into woody but i dont think imaginative casting is enough one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie unless hes just doing it for the money and if thats the case why not just reissue an allrap version of whats up tiger lily
