im a big fan of italian films from the seventies and i wouldnt hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time so i did go into this film with some hopes however it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isnt going to go anywhere clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that its also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting as the title suggests the film focuses on a rogue in this case one that steals womanises and smuggles stuff thats basically all the plot that this movie has the film does have a real seventies style to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point although whatever that point is doesnt come across very well seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure and that is the case here too shes definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film overall the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style but unfortunately it doesnt have much else to offer
