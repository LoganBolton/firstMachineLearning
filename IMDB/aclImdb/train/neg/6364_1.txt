absolute garbage worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etcbr br truly dire acting not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculpturesbr br watch it just for how truly bad this film is it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie i dont have much love for this movie as it wasnt born in the 80sbr br if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector those are proper martial arts filmsbr br have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is
