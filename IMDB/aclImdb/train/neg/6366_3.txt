there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie the girlfriend and i both love action films especially fight scenes bloodsport and kickboxer was awesome but this movie was not entertaining five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and angry facial expressions the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times the army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique the music isnt good either they fight to the rap and hiphop style of the streets cause these guys are thugs the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to lowbudget dramasbr br everything about this movie is classic bstyle the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood alleyway the film is called honor but there was no honor in making this film it was simply a waste of money and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorablebr br go see felon instead the fight scenes and situations are more real
