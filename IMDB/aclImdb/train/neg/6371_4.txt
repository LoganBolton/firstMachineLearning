cause theyre both pretty lousy i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture rip someone to bloody pieces and calmly reenter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened now you know a movies in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attentionbr br i admit i paid 30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie i know what youre thinking30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole and you would be absolutely correct this movie sucks there its right out in the open i was expecting some actual scares and i waited and waited and waited none came the raven probably a crow in makeup didnt scare me seeing small pieces of internal organs didnt scare me and even faye didnt scare me im not that brave i know so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble whats more jennifer wasnt scared either her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything her life was rapidly coming to a close and shes worried about attaining more money honey you cant take money where youre going i need money she continually says completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to functionbr br meanwhile i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother faye i was suspicious at first faye playing a grandmother and all and i was still suspicious at the end there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmotherfromhell are forced to share temporarily and im guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother heres the weird partthe relative looks like shes just endured her eight hundredth birthday party mary ellen looks like shes just gotten a facelift from a renowned surgeon facelifts cant work miracles but i think fayes appearance is important to the ricepaper plot spoiler it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad actingsorry my little joke seriously though theres all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate yuck huh interestingly enough mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact how did she avoid the family curse somethings up with her obviouslybr br another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollarsthis movie features one of my alltime movie pet peeves i refer to the double ending this movie ends twice i absolutely hate it when that happens and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending didnt like it and forget to remove it during editing i guess its supposed to be scary but it is only if youre a film editorbr br there is one perk to this debacle though and its one of the reasons i bought the dvd the filmmaker commentary features faye dunaway and i wanted to see how she acted when she didnt have lines to recite guess whatthe movie sucked so bad i wasnt able to sit through it again drat
