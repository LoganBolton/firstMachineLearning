oh this was a really bad movie the girl who plays jennifer is ok but i think she acts bitchy through the movie not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly i really cant recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe i was intrigued a bit by the references to his workravens house of usherlike family curseand being buried alivestill he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film
