jennifers shadow is set in argentina  starts as jennifer cassi gina philips arrives there after her sister johanna dies jennifer is left johannas large house in her will jennifer decides to sell the house  head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen faye dunaway is opposed to the sale however strange things begin to happen jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her  she starts to feel very ill after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidneys have mysteriously disappeared what is happening to jennifer is it an ancient family curse will jennifer be the next to succumb to itbr br this argentinian american coproduction was cowritten  codirected by daniel de la vega  pablo parés  is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes a tedious  predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them the script by vega parés  pj pettiette is pretty slow going  tedious which is not what anyone wants i mean im sure most people dont want to sit down  be bored out of their skulls the characters are all uninteresting  fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy how did he know about the demons what is his interest  motivation for getting involved i couldnt see it jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable  bland leading lady her grandmother mary allen is as clichéd as they come  its surprising that she is so obviously the villain i mean for this sort of mystery based horrorghost story its surprisingly predictable  routine there are gaps in both logic  the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isnt much of a twist i didnt like jennifers shadow one iotabr br directors vega  parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but its been done so many times before  often so much better that it didnt do much for me at all  just makes the whole film look dull  lifeless theres a definite 40s period look as well from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again its rather half hearted  cheap looking jennifers shadow is well made but its rather forgettable its not scary or creepy  its rather predictable if that wasnt enough theres no gore either theres a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people  a beating heart but nothing elsebr br with a supposed budget of about 1000000  retitled to the chronicles of the raven for its us  international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million wont buy you too much these days  jennifers shadow pretty much proves that theory there are too many scenes of actors speaking in thick argentinian accents as well even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly  is obviously there for the moneybr br jennifers shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixedup zombies 1964 again instead a total waste of time
