with a movie called gayniggers from outer space how could you go wrong just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters use the village people as the main suppliers for the soundtrack and throw in tons of gaygags plot is unimportant too bad this film doesnt contain any of this and every joke misses the spot the characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger one or two jokes work the rest failsbr br the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film my expectation were to high apparently
