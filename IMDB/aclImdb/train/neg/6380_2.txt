well what can i say about this movie im speechless i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that really pised me off was the music and to top it all off someone commented on how much they liked it to them all i have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time fistsof fury starring bruce lee if he was still alive and ever came across this movie hed be horrified the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape i say tape because a movie like that couldnt possibly have been shot on filmi now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it the only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity what is this world coming to
