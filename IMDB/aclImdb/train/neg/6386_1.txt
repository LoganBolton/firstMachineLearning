i really wanted to like this movie but it was just imposable the acting was ultra hammy the plot was annoying and the pace was slow sooo slowwwwww the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end twenty minuets into a films and im praying for an ending sure some of the visuals were nice but cmon guys i mean really and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasnt much music to speak of the music there was was annoying and boring there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too those were also annoying mainly this film managed to bore me and creep me out at the same timebr br im glad its over i need to go see tideland and wash this bad taste out of my mouth
