i waited almost 25 years to see this movie thinking it might be an underrated work from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been it starred one of the best film villains of all time was based on a beloved series of childrens books and was a disney studios production what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs almost everythingbr br well not everything vincent price as rattigan and henry mancinis swanky score are the movies two saving graces price is wickedly enjoyable and mancini more professional than the material deserves they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity br br meanwhile the rest of the movie while filled with inappropriately adult situations still suffers from a completely dull script blandly generic voice work terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldnt have been out of place on any of disneys mid1980s saturday morning tv showsbr br this was a complete disappointment to me its amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh costing a fraction of this an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running timebr br the extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and mancini
