hg is normally exploitive and its never really bothered me beforei loved bloodfeast 2 but i really dont like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch im not opposed to witches and i liked carrie the novel and the movie but this one bothered me i think its because of the main character developing esp from an electric line also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases i wasnt alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99 of the time and then just snap nothing could be further from the truth i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder whoever wrote this script didnt know much about psychologybr br there were some decent concepts to the movie i liked the way the witch used men it was a nice change i liked how she could make herself attractive but didnt when she was around her forced lovers i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber this may have been a decent movie
