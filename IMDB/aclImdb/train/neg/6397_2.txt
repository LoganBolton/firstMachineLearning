thats a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing else to watch i somehow get sucked into really bad moviesbr br but this one was fairly watchable the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh and thats why i gave this movie a 2 instead of 1 the story was stupidbut in that way that makes you laugh too stupid funnybr br i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead i was surprised to see him as a younger guyand he was the only funny character anyway
