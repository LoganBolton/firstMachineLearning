one richard pryor and jackie gleason two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid theyve both sold themselves out in this one worse than pryors character two horrible overly sentimental script that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched three choice of a black actor as the toy the racial subtext of this is unbearable as its never addressed theres no message here pryors part could have been played by any comedic actor four that kidi wish i could go back in time and prevent him from ever actingthat would mean movies like this one and kid co might not have been madeand my childhood would have been free of their mindwarping power so if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick go ahead if you want to see them in something good see pryors old standup act and gleason in something better like the honeymooners
