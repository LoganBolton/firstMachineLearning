spoilers if such a thing is possible        as a rabid robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first onscreen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mindnumbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skitbr br im all for bawdy humor but this humor wasnt pleasantly vulgar or ribald it was just mindnumbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film
