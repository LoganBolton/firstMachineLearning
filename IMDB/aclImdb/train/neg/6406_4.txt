an update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th century its a string of several jokes acted out some of them you could tell your grandmother some of them not but its a fairly safe bet shes heard them all before for what it tries to be its not too bad before you rent it remember that its an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation robin williams has a couple of bits but hes interchangeable with the other players
