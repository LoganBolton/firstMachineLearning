the films of upa are surprisingly well rated on imdb despite the fact that the animation quality is lightyears behind that of looney toons disney and mgm at their prime sadly due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high framerates and lovely backgrounds the upa style which debuted about 1950 began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s after all the films were dirt cheap to make and theyd received several oscars to prove that the cartoons were now mainstream so as a result lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasnt reversed until the 1980sbr br this upa film is one of the early ones the characters are very simply drawn any simpler and they would have used stick figures and the backgrounds were uglysimple line drawings with colors added in a very slapdash manner often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the itemsbr br as for the story its a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude some will love this others will just find it very very loud its the traditional frankie and johnny story and because of the shootings and all its probably not a great film for the kids heck because of the animation and jazz its not a particularly good film for me either some will read my review and no doubt think i am a crank which i am to a degree however i love animated films and a little of this minimalistic upa style goes a very very long way and you cant seriously consider them great works of artjust very very quickly made cartoons ignore the oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or somethinganything else
