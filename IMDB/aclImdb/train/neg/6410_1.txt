i think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for rogue pictures latest release the return i myself along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film on the contrary though its actually a supernatural thriller too bad it is not the least bit thrillingbr br the return stars sarah michelle gellar as joanna mills a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met while in texas on a business trip she is led by these visions to the murdered womans hometown la salle there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions a man by the name of terry stahl who is played by peter obrien joanna is now on a desperate search for answers a search that could in the end result in her very own murderbr br i really dont know where to begin here folks which should i mention first the atrocious acting hideous directing or the terribly bland story no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same they simply suck adam sussmans screenplay is downright moronic its not interesting its not compelling its just plain unpleasant i kept waiting for something to jumpstart the film ive placed quotations around film because i dont believe the return deserves to be called an actual film due to its foulness and at least give it some slight chance of hope but nothing ever happened i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the film i assume this is why the acting was so awful at least thats what im choosing to believe i really hope the cast doesnt pride themselves on their performances they need immediate medical attention if they dobr br now the directing was unmistakably bad but i cant quite crucify asif kapadia entirely well i could but i wont since im such a nice guy i look at the return as a test for kapadia because for all of you that dont know this is his first fulllength feature film hes just getting his foot in the door and still learning next time around well if there is a next time hopefully he will have improved vastly the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of marcus nispels 2003 remake of the texas chainsaw massacre now thats nice the film was given that but unfortunately he still wont be receiving any kudos from me for that copying someone elses work isnt something i consider to be praise worthy even if it is from a film i very much enjoyedbr br i think jim sonzeros american remake of pulse will now have to fork over the title of worst film of the year to the return it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way now i dont doubt this will make a small and i mean very small profit no matter what though it wont surpass or even parallel the fluke success of gellars previous acting effort the grudge on that note theres one last thing id like to add i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing the return that is something i never wish to experience again along with the film itself
