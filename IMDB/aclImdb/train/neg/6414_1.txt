this is by the far worst piece of cr4p ive ever seen in my life it barely made sense it wasnt scary at all unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming sarahmichelle gellar needs to stop with these sh1tty horror films i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted shite when the credits rolled up br br on my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would gobr br 1 the return 2 cabin fever 3 silent hillbr br the reason i made silent hill 3rd is because it showed some frightening scenes but the rest was absolute cr4p same with cabin fever made no sense but the return topped that list its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together
