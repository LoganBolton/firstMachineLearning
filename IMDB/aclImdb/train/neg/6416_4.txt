some notsospoily spoilers aheadbr br why do people when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom br br who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room br br how often do you knock on a strangers door and when they dont immediately answer you open the door walk in shout a few hellos and then start going through their stuff br br if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer what would you do quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements run quietly of course to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure br br i could be talking about almost any thriller thats come out in the last few years but since this is the the return page obviously im talking about the return i saw it free because i work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the scary movies i thought this one was tolerable aside from the wellworn clichés sarah michelle gellar is really drab and looks kind of huh through most of the film the details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and its almost enough to make it interesting except there wasnt enough explanation as it moved on and so i was almost lost until the last 23 of itbr br if youre a diehard thriller fan its worth seeing at least once if theres nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie eh i guess its worth a matinée ticket if you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you cant wait wait
