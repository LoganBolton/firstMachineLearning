let me start off by saying i am not a fan of horror movies i never watch thembr br let me tell you about my experiencebr br the only reason i watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over happy feetbr br i never saw happy feet but i am sure it is better than thismovie anyway we didnt actually expect it to be goodwe actually went in just to laugh at it cool with mei have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out it did not matterbr br after 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into borat a movie i would have gladly seen again over this the movie was not scary and not stupid so it would be funnyit was just boring it wasnt terrible like baby genuises terrible it was terrible likenot entertaining at all avoidbr br now i am no expert but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a pg13 horror that is boring and not scary or you can have an r gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for peoplebr br you want a pg13 horror that sucks but is funny see the grudge avoid this movie like the plaguebecause it may literally bore you to deathbr br 010
