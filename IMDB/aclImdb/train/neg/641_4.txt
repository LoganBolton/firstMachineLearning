in my knowledge largo winch was a famous belgium comics never read telling the adventures of a playboy a sort of james bond without the spy life so when i had to choose a movie for a 5 yearsold kid i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bondbr br but just after the opening credits i got heavy doubts when american movies offer amazing start here no action and a torrid sex scene  then the story get very complicated with financial moves i thought i lost the kidbr br but strangely he had been caught by largo and more than james bond br br was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley the difficult relationship largo has with his father the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys the bad guys are the friends the exotic locations of honkkong yougoslavia br br dunno but he really cares about largo will he get up and we enjoyed our moment
