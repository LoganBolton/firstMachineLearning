i just viewed this movie last night and i dont think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stick in the back of my mindbr br the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie i think of a few good men which is a good thing now every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson i will think of tinseltown which is a very bad thingbr br i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman i thought that it at least wouldnt be bad you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling indiana where exactly but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie wrongbr br this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutesbr br the characters are paperthin you almost care about none of the characters and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them okay the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves so they figure so does the audience they dont even think about character development except for trying to tie there story back to gilligans islandbr br the plot is unoriginal two guys live in a storage center where one of them stores a bed and there are about twenty other people living there too the rest of the story is contrived and stupid have you seen national lampoons favorite deadly sins the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who cant find a good story to make a tv movie about so he creates one now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age and take away the comedy and you have this moviebr br the actors try kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie she is still hot but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos as for everyone else i dont think it was the actors fault because they have bad materialbr br go watch the national lampoons movie but stay away from this movie
