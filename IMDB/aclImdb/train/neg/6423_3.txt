the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote poised to flick around to watch something else the premise of two writers down on their luck living in a selfstoragespace bin was mildly amusing but painfully blandbr br the introduction of the character played by joe pantoliano  the big deal movie guy that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director  borderline nymphomaniac added a bit of spice her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eyecandy inclusionbr br ultimately the obvious lowbudget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget whithnail  i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream but down on their luckbr br however for my money the actors save tinseltown from the terrible movie archives and just about nudges it into the could have been a cult movie archives i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantolianos character in particular the penultimate scenes in the terribly clich√©d but still funny richbutscrewedup characters house where the story unravels towards its final momentsbr br i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the filmmakers did their best to translate this to celluloid it simply didnt work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anythingbr br unless youre stuck for a novelty coffee coaster dont pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket
