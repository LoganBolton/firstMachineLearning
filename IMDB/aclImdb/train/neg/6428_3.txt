this makes the third errol morris movie ive seen and im increasingly not liking his style he seems to find very interesting and varied characters great personalities to create documentaries for and then with tongueincheek editing make fun of everything they are about its never really a direct caricaturation of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying but no no these people are really fascinating really but theres always these subtle little canted angles and notsosubtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their backbr br this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation a man who studies african hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly antlike a lion tamer a man who keeps a garden full of animalshaped shrubbery and a robot designer the general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal human and life features so the title of fast cheap  out of control doesnt really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie right except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals passions he might call them obsessions making synthetic designs on life i share not that fear and honestly dont appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the filmbr br but i stress his subtlety with no voiceover narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees its not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators collective head instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when theyre taken out of the context of the circus and the ants showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about i dont find them absurd i find them all very neat and interesting individualsbr br unless of course he didnt intend such juxtapositions which means hes just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter considering none of this films ive seen so far have particularly impressed me i dont really care to find out what hes trying to dobr br polarisdib
