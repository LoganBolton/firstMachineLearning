spoilersbr br first off nothing really happened in this movie other than a woman bleeding inexplicably second it wasnt scary third it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever let me elaborate the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead  im not sure which so lets just go with beavis the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter forcing you to turn up the volume i watched this at home then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scaryshocking images forcing you to quickly lower the volume again this occurs many times until mercifully the movie ends i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the twoway mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep this one is a big mistake but then its a big mistake anyway heres a thought  if youre going to make a horror movie at least add a gratuitous beheading a 19yearold blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil a la tvs lost in space these people didnt even try to scare me they just wanted to hurt my ears
