i didnt really know what this movie was about when i went to the theater to see it hype about the satanism etc etc etc as the trailers in the last movie i saw looked pretty interestingbr br oh dear roman catholic mythology not my idea of a good scare and honestly i just felt like watching a really good scary movie not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutesbr br ill try to keep away from the spoilers  but i found it very odd that an atheist who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest could suddenly end up with christs wounds arent stigmata supposed to be deeply religious i mean she hangs out with losers does loser stuff behaves like a typical rebel et al and here she is displaying the wounds of jesus christ come onbr br scenes of her crucified head thrown back screaming blood everywhere became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times it was neither frightening or scary just repulsive it did however become quite painful to watch  those flicking scenes were highly annoyingbr br conclusion if your a catholic defintly dont see this if youre not still dont see it
