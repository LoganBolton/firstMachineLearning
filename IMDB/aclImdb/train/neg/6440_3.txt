this was one of the worst wrestlemanias ive seen it just didnt stand out at all really card wise i thought it was going to be pretty good but every match just seemed to fall shortbr br chris benoit vs mvp one of the better matches benoit carried it i just didnt think mvp was that great but benoit saved this match br br kane vs khali wow these two guys dont mix or maybe its khali and any other person alive dont mix awful matchbr br melina vs ashley im not a fan of female wrestlingbr br ecw originals vs new breed i was excited about this match until i saw it really really disappointingbr br edge vs cm punk vs king booker vs jeff hardy vs matt hardy vs mr kennedy vs finlay vs randy orton absolutely the worst mitb match so far just a major let down to many people in the ring at the same time it just didnt live upbr br bobby lashley vs umaga ok not extremely impressive but not the worst of the nightbr br batista vs undertaker this was maybe the best match of the night very very very nice to see something good for a change br br john cena vs shawn michaels i really feel like this match deserved to be last people make a case for batista vs undertaker but this match was just as good i am starting to get sick of seeing cena win every match though its getting a little old now i have to say i feel this match is the best of the night but im a huge shawn michaels fan so im a little biased batista vs taker may have been better but im biased sosorry the last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night and most everything else really came up short
