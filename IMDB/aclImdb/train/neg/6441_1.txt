when i looked at this years wrestlemanias match card i was so stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitementbr br it startsand it endsbr br im sitting there angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back i mean you watch wrestlemania 22 one of my favorites which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when hbk tapped out that very moment of hbk losing to john cena john cena is such a loserposer it almost ruined wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat triple h i couldnt watch wwe after seeing wrestlemania 23 im starting to watch it again luckily i again have faith in wwe after wrestlemania 24 the greatest i have ever seen which was a pure classic wrestlemania it definitely made up for mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as wellbr br if you have watched any of the wrestlemanias before this one like the ones that turn you into fans wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan please dont watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind and if you do watch it and are angry start watching it again and watch wrestlemania 24 it is absolutely classic
