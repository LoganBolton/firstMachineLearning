not only does the films author steven greenstreet obviously idolize michael moore but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of moores propaganda filmmaking tactics moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though while greenstreet is obviously less skilled herebr br having been privy to all of the issues surrounding moores speech at uvsc i was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community  that moore was being paid 40000 of the state of utah s educational funds to basically promote john kerrys campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie  were pushed to the background by greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalizedbr br the marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable promoting the film by claiming that mormons tried to kill moore not only is this preposterous but it defames a major religion that greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with i followed moores visit very closely and all of the major news agencies noted that moores visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in utahbr br greenstreet has banked on this film to jumpstart his filmmaking career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this this seems to have been a severe miscalculation though since moores visits to roughly 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest for this rather common event greenstreets assumption that american audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesnt seem to be well foundedbr br even the name of the film this divided state is somewhat of a misnomer since utah voted overwhelmingly for bushs reelection and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other state the division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in greenstreets ideological differences with his religion and state if anything i find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and woody allens hilarious contention in sleeper 1973 that i was beaten up by quakers
