i was one of the few nonliberals who showed up to see steves video it was quite an experience in propaganda filmmaking and boredombr br i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moores visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slashandburn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems selfserving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issuesbr br whats more surprising is to see all the 10 votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the presidents men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film br br yeah like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out
