when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated  on a per capita basis europe britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a percapta basis the actual size of neonazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultraright wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society by doing so greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash sensationalism at its worst anti usa garbage shameful
