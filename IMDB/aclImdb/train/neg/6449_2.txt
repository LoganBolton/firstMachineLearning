imagine the big chill with a cast of twentysomethings whose characters are all unlikable and an iguanalike manlizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein on the positive side the movie does not skimp on showing the monster theres no peekaboo shots or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like hes right out there folks unfortunately the design and construction arent that inspired a little bit of mystery might have helped mind you ive seen far worse but if youre going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick your monster better look damn good br br spoiler aheadbr br oh and theres a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script as for the acting well lets just say it wasnt painfully bad but i dont expect well be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outingsbr br gore quotient 2 out of 5 nudity quotient 1 out of 5 intelligence quotient negligible
