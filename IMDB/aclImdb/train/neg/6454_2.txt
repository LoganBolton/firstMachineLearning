the monster from enemy mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community where he has taken up residence hes being hunted by a female doctorturnedvigilante who is out to exterminate him this female assassin who looks like a refugee from a motley crue video rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a big chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monsters turf decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the island of dr moreau and yes its worse than the one with val kilmer
