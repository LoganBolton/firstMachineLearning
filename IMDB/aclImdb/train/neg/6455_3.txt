really a terrible movie its to be expected though clearly a low budget nothing all that innovative an actress if you can call what she does acting who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predator a cabin in the woods etc but there are some redeeming points although the story is not new for the most part theres a few parts that arent so regurgitated for one the black guy doesnt die when hes attacked the first time and he isnt even one of the first couple to die but thats minor more importantly theres a very interesting twist regarding kats experiments and wes  steve that i didnt see coming when steve told kat he knew what she did i believed what he said and what kat replied with but when the creature revealed who he really was i was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation it could be because of my lack of experience with the genre or that its a genuinely clever twistbr br either way the movies pretty bad and dont watch it if theres anything better on unless youre in the mood for a cheap scifi flick
