in all my years of filmgoing only once have i walked out on a film and that was the dreadful stay tuned fortunately the cinema refunded the ticket and i went to see buffy the vampire slayer instead a minor improvement that film is gone with the wind compared to dick a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of dick was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it let alone laugh with itbr br granted paying to see a movie with a title like dick suggests that it will be filled with inane dick jokes and wind up a huge letdown and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast daniel hedaya bruce mccullough dave foley kristen dunst etc etc and a premise that at least promised something fresh what the film delivered was as portended four woefully predictable dick jokes comic timing suffering from jetlag and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes in short it was the watergate scene from forrest gump stretchednay laid on a rack and mangledover 90 excruciating minutesbr br as soon as you understand that the two main charactersairless insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantlywill participate in every major watergate event you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses 18 and a half minutes erased from the nixon tapes check the deep throat meetings with woodward and bernstein check john dean getting a change of heart and testifying check the process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real watergate affair with about as much laughgetting to boot and though it posits to be an amusing redeconstruction of the events leading to president nixons resignation it turns into a paintbythenumbers chooseyourownadventure fillintheblanks comedy that says very little and entertains even lessbr br even the films strong pointthe aforementioned castis bewilderingly unproductive here the most disappointing of all is harry shearer as g gordon liddy trapped as he is behind the thick liddy moustache and straitjacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay shearer mumbles a few lines tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows then disappears dave foley one of the comic masterminds from kids in the hall two others bruce mccullough and mark mckinney also appear in this filmah the blessings of nepotism fares badly as well his hr haldeman occasionally lends a muchneed lightening of the funeral plot but the funniest thing about him is the buzzcut he sportsperhaps the films funniest bit of all and then theres daniel hedaya as richard nixonoops i mean dick ha ha how amusingly funny he manages to play a solid nixon avoiding the pitfalls such as overdone make up rubbery nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins while preserving the essence the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness i seem to be forgetting someone    oh yes the two stars of the film those overbubbly teenagers cant remember their names perhaps because i have repressed their performances nothing could be farther from funny nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of hyperactive and superhyperactive with an occasional pouty tossed inbr br this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a 70s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the me decade but the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot a kind of extraplot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writingbr br the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david letterman or conan obrien this dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all thisthe writers and producerswill be far from the cameras gaze possibly cooking up another disaster such as thisbr br
