can anybody tell me where is the comedy  br br charlie sheen is a very weak comedian thomas haden church is looking so feeble with him  and the whole thing is so thickheaded  br br they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasnt even funny like the plans scene in the bathroom it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more except pain  br br donald sutherland  his relationship with his daughter br br this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it  but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all br br well it wouldve been uglier if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real starbr br the sheens family in here just be aware of that br br anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or god forbid loving it  then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else br br brando undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isnt  and he wasnt intending to be one in here after reading this for sure  but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a small time smart or even good  sorry im crying now  the movies torturing is unbelievable  br br there is a scene where brando hitting mira sorvino by her shoes  that was so realistic  maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap  br br for the milliard time  this one couldve been better or less worse  the script till the trains heist was nice and i just imagined that theyd escape to have some chase like its another smokey and the bandit but with brando as the sheriff in fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what ive watched br br why this masterpiece didnt receive any razzie award  you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this  i do not think so  its a situation where the razzies supervisor must himself win one for his negligence br br martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son  and why is that  well  because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies werent as good as its ambition  br br its not a comedy movie no its a horror one  and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones  br br name good thing about it hmmm  well this one compared to another marlon brandos monster movie the island of dr moreau  1996 would be close to casablanca  br br ps  if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad the ugly and the very ugly in this movie just pray your last prayers and go watch it may god help you
