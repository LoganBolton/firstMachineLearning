i watched free money last night  it was the longest 90 minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat  especially since im a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent its almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle prod scene  there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups why didnt they show charlie sheens character going back to tow brandos truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasnt buying into it skip this one only for diehard brando fansbr br im giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo
