watching marlen brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany brandos acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable the plot is inane and laughable not comic the other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful the director throws freezeframe and slowmotion shots about with impunity the incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect its not something i really look for in a movie but even the wardrobe was way off the venerable brando couldnt take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in ive heard this movie called david lynchesquire and irreverently funny it is neither david lynch films are borne of wicked creativity  this film was in no way creative and dont confuse irreverence with stupidity
