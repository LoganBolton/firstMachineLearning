marlon brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film his performance as the swede is the worst of his career and that is precisely what he intended it to be he doesnt overact instead he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth the scene where brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst funniest moment in the history of cinema as we witness him fall headfirst into a toilet it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in a streetcar named desire on the waterfront and the godfatherbr br i guess the real question is why marlon behaved like this in his later years was he sick of the movie business did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself i guess well never know but this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all aboutbr br on that note watch fellow acting veteran donald sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty
