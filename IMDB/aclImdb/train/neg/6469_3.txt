when i was younger i thought the first film was really good in childhood so i decided to see the sequel this is an example of why some films shouldnt have sequels because the first film is usually best and it is basically now that ariel and eric are married they have a daughter who isnt allowed outside the house because they are worried about the sister of ursula the octopus legged villain from film one morgana getting to her when the kid gets out she asks ursulas sister to turn her into a mermaid like her mum was this makes ariel go back to the sea to find her the same good voice artists its just the story that could have had a bit more thought adequate
