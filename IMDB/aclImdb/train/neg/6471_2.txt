this is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie and it works on some level but the new characters are just not interesting baby melody is hideously horrible alas while the logic that humans cant stay underwater forever is maintained other basic physical logic are ignored its chilly if you dont have cold weather garments if youre in the arctic i dont know why most comments here return of jafar rates worse i thought this one is more horrible
