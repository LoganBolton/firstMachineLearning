the little mermaid is one of my absolute favorite disney movies im sorry to say however that disney completely messed up when they made this sequel ill admit it has some good points to it the songs arent bad and the animation is clean and clear there is some humor im surei dont remember because after watching it i immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again the worst point of this movie is the plot in this movie ariel becomes her father she forbids her daughter to go near the sea yes out of fear just as she was forbidden to go near the land i personally think that given her past ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treatedbr br besides this fact ursula was replaced by a nonscary pathetic sort of sea witch the underfed forgotten sister who is more comical than scary she too has some little underling to do her biddingbut shes not scarier or worse than ursula ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness this sea witch is a jokebr br to make matters worse flounder is a fat deepvoiced father no longer the cute guppy we all know and love and erics voice is not even done by the same actor something that always annoys me in a remakesequel his voice difference was very obvious to me by the way i felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that disney could catch a few fast dollars something i hate to think about a corporation i actually really do enjoy i felt that this plot lacked imagination i know that this act child following in the footsteps of a parent happens but ariel was different that was what we loved so much about her she had a dream she fell in love and she made that dream come true until she appeared in this movie that is then she became just like the other adults this isnt the ariel i know and i dont like herbr br i know of some children who have enjoyed this film and i know some adults who didnt mind it either but for me and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for ariel please dont see this movie the ariel we know dies within resurrected only for a song or two and one final scene that actually isnt bad where she accepts the water back againalthough she takes very little part in the ending regardless
