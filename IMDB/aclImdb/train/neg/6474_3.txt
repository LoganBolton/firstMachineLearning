this was the first sequel id seen apart from return of jafar and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original i was horribly disappointedbr br the storyline was basically the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around ariel and eric have a daughter melody who isnt satisfied with life on land she wants to become a mermaid however ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect herand when melody finds out shes upset and angry and she then decides to run away and she becomes a mermaid so shes happy swimming around and ariel sets out to find heras a mermaidbr br the story doesnt sound too bad written down but the clich√©s and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious and adding the fact that melody is overall extremely annoying and the movie becomes almost unbearablebr br theres also a whole load of other new characterstip and dash being two of them they arent too bad as characters in themselvesjust try not to think of timon or pumbaa the songs leave a lot to be desired too they just dont have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did the animation obviously didnt have a whole load of work put into it eitherin parts its jumpy and not much imagination is used for the characters movementsbr br another piece of advicetry to forget about ariels original character while watching this movie the beautiful rebellious curious teenager has all grown up into a bland boring wife and mother and her trademark red hair is all tied up this is much better viewed if youve never seen the originalyoull have nothing to compare it tobr br however all in all it could have been worseits not as bad as certain other sequels such as cinderella ii but its not in the same league as the original but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this theyll lose all their older fans
