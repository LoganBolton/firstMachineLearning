though ive yet to review the movie in about two years i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did having loved the original little mermaid and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be i decided id take the time to sit down and watch the sequelbr br disney ive got a little message for you if you dont have the original director and actors handyyoure just looking to get your butt whoopedbr br in the sequel our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter melody my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang yes i understand that disney is big on singanddance numbers but really thats what made eric my favorite prince he was calm collected and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun and he did not singbr br and then theres the villain oh how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world unfortunately that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister morgana nothing was ever ever said about morgana in the first movie she just pops out of nowhere trying to steal the baby oh how cute the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident decides to kidnap a monthold baby gag mebr br other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her morgana was just very unorthodox the same plan as her sister the same minions who by the way did not scare anyone i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie and she laughed hysterically she had no purpose being in there id like to have seen mom be the villain im sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over therebr br king triton held none of the respect hed earned from me in the first movie and dont even get me started on scuttle sebastian and flounder triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie and in the second its almost like hes lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects scuttle once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his dinglehopper yes ill admit it i did call my fork a dinglehopper from time to time after that in this film scuttles all but forgotten a supporting character even in the first he at least added something to the movie he was rich with a flavor the others didnt have and in the sequel they all but stripped it from him entirely sebastian was still the same but twice as worrisome as before disney dont do that dont even try to mess with our favorite crab or our favorite little fat fish who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children hes fat and hes bland and he looks like hes going to flat line any secondbr br the walrus and penguin were unneeded and after a while you just start to resent everyone especially melody who has no depth to her whatsoeverbr br and one of these days disney im kicking out of my lifebr br if i didnt love your originals so much
