i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much it seems that disney however is trying to perfect the art of crappy straighttodvd sequels they deserve a razzie several in fact i thought the idea had merit but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasnt much better what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films mary poppins aladdin beauty and the beast the lion kingeven hercules and the hunchback of notre dame theyve made so many great movies over the years that its really sad that theyve sunk to point of making sequels that arent even good enough to put in theatresbr br i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation
