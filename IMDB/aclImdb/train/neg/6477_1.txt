i loved the first little mermaid i know the songs i love the characters and i love the story i cant say anything like that about the little mermaid ii return to the sea it was terrible lets start with the story the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie same situations except in reverse ariel wanted to live on land her daughter melody creative name wants to live in the sea ariel was tricked by ursula melody is tricked by ursulas sister morgana ursula had a sister not sure where that came from besides being a strange copy of the first movie this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie now the characters 1 ariel what happened to her no longer the spunky headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie she has now grown up and her personality went down the drain her singing voice wasnt as strong either due to either jodi benson being a lot older or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted 2 prince eric while he didnt have a lot of personality in the first movie like all disney princes somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic to top it off he just cant seem to defend himself and ariel becomes the tough one of the two 3 sebastian say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie because a whiny aggravating little crab just took his place he also had no good songs in this movie you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible under the sea and kiss the girl from the first movie and it is very sad 4 flounder they destroyed him he is not cute anymore his voice is terrible and he has kids now whos the mother 5 morgana she appears to be ursulas sister out for revenge against her mother who always picked ursula over her so she plans to get king tritons trident to become the new ruler of the sea sound familiar anyway shes a very clich√© villain and falls short of ursulas greatness as a villain she epically fails at witchcraft shes not very tough and not threatening at all 6melody ariel and erics daughter ironic name because she unlike ariel cant sing her voice is annoying her friends a walrus and a penguin really are not funny or likable and shes exactly the same as ariel in reverse and not as likable skip this one dont watch any disney sequel except for lion king 2 this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories i will look back at this movie and just laugh
