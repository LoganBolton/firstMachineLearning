disney has yet to meet a movie it couldnt make at least two sequels about and this one was no exception to the people at disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward somehow although i did not pay to view it i feel cheapened by watching itbr br ariel is grown up now and had a daughter yet doesnt allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased seawitch so here we go againbr br the daughter is tricked of course and helps the seawitch after a notsoglorious battle she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony yawnbr br there is nothing to view here go back to your lives d
