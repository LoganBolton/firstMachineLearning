it wasnt good the characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories i had of the previous movie which contrasted with the new personalities or lack thereof i seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by ariel because of how absurd it was it was serious it just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the disney channeleveryone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connectionbr br the most disappointing part was the horrible songsnot catchy not amazing in the original ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun you remember them and want to sing them but the songs in this movie werent creative in the least its as if theyre talking in a annoying singsong voicequite weakly disappointing i dont have that wanttosingthem feeling you normally get from a disney moviebr br its as if not one wanted to do this movie so they barely made an effort    this movie would needs a new story line new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying look at me look at me im so annoying mentality of this generation of disney
