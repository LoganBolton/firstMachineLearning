if theres one thing you can count on disney to do its their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience disneys going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever it even had that spaghetti meatball scene its been done before and thats what i say to this sorry direct to videothe entire concept should be banned everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluths really bad movies the penguin and walrus duoive even forgotten their names are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa morgana is another ursula she even repeats practically all her old lines the songs are pathetic really abysmal ive never heard songs so bad from them before until now and the dialogue is atrocious its pathetic and simplistic on the plus side at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent all of the usual characters arent as annoying as they used to beor maybe thats a minus for little mermaid fans back on the negative melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit i almost did do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor dont waste your money on this true its not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii but thats little consolation
