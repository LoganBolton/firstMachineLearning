yep the topic is a straight quote from the movie and i think its pretty accurate i was so bored to dead with this pointless effort all the flashes etc making no sense after first 20 minutes is just bad film making  if you are epileptic you would have died at least five times already of course all the david lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be the best film ever made because it doesnt make any sense and when it doesnt make any sense its got to be art and art movie is always good right i say wrong this kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that youre a good film maker anthony hopkins as a excellent actor should just stay acting
