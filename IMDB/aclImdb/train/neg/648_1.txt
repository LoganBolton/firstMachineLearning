the night of the prom the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some headpeckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule livesbr br there really is no excuse for prom night there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of ghosts it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of thembr br the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage and the thing was it wasnt even a slightly exciting rampage maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didnt really add to the effect either and to make matters worse the rest of the characters were equally onedimensional and oblivious the hotel staff didnt seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets nice onebr br the worst thing was i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening shocking and the music dont even get me started it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeralbr br i really wish that prom night was a joke it was terrible and stupidly predictable no one in their right mind or otherwise has any reason to see this film mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film hear my plea dont do it there are better things to spend six pounds on like a sheet to play ghosts with
