this movie was a complete waste of timebr br i viewed this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts who have varied taste in movies yet always a keen eye for a work of genius as one of my fellow commenters on this site had the gall to label this steaming pile not one of them found a single redeeming quality we ended the movie with a rousing chorus of expletives i will not reprint herebr br i can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by sir anthony hopkins himself afterall as one of those reviewers will tell you he financed the film himself  because no one else in hollywood or anywhere else in the world for that matter would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film dont let the semifamous actors who appear in the film lure you into its clutches  as christian slater admits in the special features making of he signed on to the film without reading the script or knowing any details a folly i am sure he will never repeatbr br i pity the hapless individual who stumbles into this quagmire of selfindulgence written directed produced and financed by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece and if you dont believe me please google anthony hopkins and art
