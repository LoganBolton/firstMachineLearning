i wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy scifi genre but given the actors involved i thought id give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story wont give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didnt turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the illconceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely
