i rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed and of course sir anthony hopkinsbr br if jackson pollack teamed up with david lynch and timothy leary to make a movie this would be the end result i dont think ive seen a movie like it that made an lsd trip look like an episode of sesame streetbr br its a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality or various realities and the film doesnt culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes where all of a sudden it makes sense i wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away and i wont do that here its a well acted piece of cinema and the soundtrack was written by sir anthony hopkins and let me say this if theres one redeeming feature to this film its the music it fits perfectly some of the dialogue is unbelievably good and unbelievably bad all at the same timebr br i enjoyed parts of this movie i truly did and once you get to the end of it youll actually figure out whats truly going on its unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point which minimizes the effect of the entire moviebr br i give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isnt the acting its everything
