this movie was a disappointment i was looking forward to seeing a good movie i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesnt turn it off until the end but i was forcing myself not to turn it off br br theonly reason why i didnt turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie br br this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it if you hadnt been in this movie i would of been bored out of my mindbr br i also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting by the time the movie was over i didnt even get the plot i was both confused and annoyed
