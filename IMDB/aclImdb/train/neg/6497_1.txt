i actually had quite high hopes going into this movie so i took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best about 13 of the way through the film i simply had to give up quite simply the movie is a mishmash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and its all disconnected i love movies that make you think but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connectedbr br dont think its david lynchesquire as some would have you believe it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals saying its artsy to disguise the fact theres no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 15 hours in the film the acting was good but that cannot save lack of story i do agree with the one comment posted previously its like being in some other persons head while theyre on drugs in other words nothing makes sense
