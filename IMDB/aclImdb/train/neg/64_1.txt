this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible there was no plot to the movie whatsoever the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones their performances were excellent the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story it would be worth watching instead robert duvalls and james earl jones performances are completely wasted on a god awful storylineor lack thereof not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the moviewell an actual movienot just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time there was nothing special about any of the characters the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling senile drunk old man nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end when the movie ended i sat amazedamazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while it never happened the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning it wasnt even a story the entire movie takes place in a days worth of time thats it it was one day in the life and death of some southerners on a plantation how much of a story can take place in a single day other than the movie training day the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movieif you can even call it a movie
