given the chance to write direct and star in my own movie i would probably choose something about robot women with guns anthony hopkins however decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen slipstream is a movie that is so strange that even david lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say whats going onbr br this is a movie where in one scene a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left this is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls this is a movie where a man starts talking about invasion of the bodysnatchers only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself and then disappear into thin air br br this is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at allbr br i must however commend mr hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie some of whom portray multiple characters all of those involved throw themselves into their roles even if they probably have no idea what theyre actually doing my favourite here was christian slaters thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the american national anthem br br anthony hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and thats possibly the best way to sum up slipstream its a joke on the audience youll watch it from beginning to end trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come only to discover that the answer never actually does what the punchline to this particular joke is only anthony hopkins will ever knowbr br i mentioned david lynch earlier and im a big fan of that particular director i would guess that anthony hopkins shares my love for the likes of twin peaks blue velvet and lost highway however slipstream isnt as satisfying as any of the movies of lynch despite imitating many of his techniques although i was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in slipstream its far too chaotic and random  as another reviewer here pointed out its the movie version of alzheimers disease no doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it unfortunately for the rest of us slipstream quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to hopkins involvementbr br watch at your own risk
