what hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film however perhaps therein lies the problem his movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within but its so impersonal there are no characters we never know who anyone is thus there is no investment on our partbr br it could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters is it maybe by that i dont mean that slipstream is ambiguous i mean that there is no telling hopkinss film is an experiment on the face of it one could make the case that it is about a wouldbe screenwriter who at the very moment of his meeting with fate realizes that life is hit and miss andor success is blind chance as he is hurled into a slipstream of collisions between points in time dreams thoughts and reality nevertheless it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion even to the tiny quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its charactersbr br i didnt think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky machinegunspeed camerawork and editing disengaged me but reflecting upon the film i am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it there are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmospheredeteriorating technical doodads i suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams however i knew barely anything about slipstream when watching it and i came out the same way and i just do not care because hopkins made no effort to make us care there are interactive movies and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit unaware of your presence slipstream is the latter
