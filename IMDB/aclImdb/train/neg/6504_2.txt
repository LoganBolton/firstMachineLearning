why did i waste 15 hours of my life watching this why was this film even made why am i even commenting on this filmbr br one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was nt for everybody i cannot figure out who this movie is for maybe after dropping a hit of acid somebody somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it it is incoherent it isnt experimental its plain and simple garbage the film follows no plot line whatsoever just when you think you have something wellyou dont br br i think the ending brought some finality to the film no pun intended the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on i dont think i put a spoiler in here not that it would matter this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom
