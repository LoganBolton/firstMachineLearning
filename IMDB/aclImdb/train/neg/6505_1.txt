a confused mess from start to finish like they used to say about the beatlessongs there was a secret message if you played the lp backward if one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start youd come away with the same degree of disappointmentbr br apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and false starts the clearest characters were the movie backers out for revenge if the movie didnt get sorted there was nothing to like about these two either overacting shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion i think one dimensional was an overstatementbr br okay so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them we plebeians just didnt get it well im afraid there was nothing to get and the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish a nonexistent and pathetic story line if you want to call it that and by far the worst not a single character you cared about in the least
