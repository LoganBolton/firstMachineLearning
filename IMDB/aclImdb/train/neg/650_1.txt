why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime the texas chainsaw massacre the hills have eyes but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that werent brilliant to start with prom night the amityville horror much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasonsbr br its a poorly acted massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do its clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually bloodless and im not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm the originalbr br one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna keppel brittany snow has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in stylebr br when the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big highschool blowout by living it up and partying till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and hell slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donnabr br who will survive to see graduation day and what will donna do when shes forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis costar in the slasher remake that will have tuxedoclad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thingbr br without much to work with mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jumpscare moment desperate times really do call for desperate measures there havent been this many shots of closets since the last ikea cataloguebr br in the era of the hills my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and societys creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that moviebr br my final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night its even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hackjob remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or frights a night youll be in a hurry to forget
