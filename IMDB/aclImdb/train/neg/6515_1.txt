this is not a boring movie the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character miles berkowitz both filmmaker and actor here the storyline is simple  after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian noncareer the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera the first question is about how true is all that  what is written what came by chance  both answers yes or no portrays mberkowitz as a low average human beeing if you look for a selffiction about love like this one i recommand you to read some independant comic books  chester brown joe mattbr br beside of this i felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country france i know american people usually say that the french are arrogant that might be true then etc and for sure the french and the whole world have lots of griefs against america but why so much hate  dont think i couldnt like this movie only because of that anyhow
