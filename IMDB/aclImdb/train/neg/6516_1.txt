ripoff of a dozen better films particularly steven martins la story which at least had the grace to be obviously fictional even though it starred his thengirlfriend playing his girlfriend in the filmbr br yes naive boys and girls 20 dates is a mockumentary although i am not absolutely certain that was myles berkowitzs intent when he started my impression is that he started the project semiseriously then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous as a result the whole thing has an uneasy cheap and insincere feeling about itbr br as someone smartly pointed out the film has two of the dates suing and putting restraining orders on myles and yet they appear in the film which would be impossible as it would require a consent form it also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses albiet not famous ones excepting tina carrere  they are simply too obviously pretty polished thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civiliansbr br mr berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress instead of utilizing a variety of believable women which might have made the premise even in a mockumentary more believable and funnier he also skates over what is probably his realworld problem and which is that both the movie character and the real world myles berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed his real life imdb credits are practically nonexistent excepting this film even in the world of the movie his exwife divorced him for never being employed i think the viewer let alone mr berkowitzs real life dates are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the us in a luxury apartment driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he doesnt seen to have any source of income whatsoever is he drug dealer living off his rich parents no cluebr br you can get away with most anything in a film if the jokes are really funny 20 dates is painfully embarrassingly unfunny mr berkowitzs idea of a joke is to have his character while on restaurant dates announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation  the worst kind of childish potty humorbr br it is not very surprising to discover that mr berkowitz never made a film before 20 dates and in the last 8 years has not made a single film appeared as an actor in anyone elses film or had a writing or producing credit of any kind my gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by elie the gangster money man who appears offcamera but more likely by mr berkowitzs affluent parents or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards whichever it was we can all rest easy that we are unlikely to have to see myles berkowitz or any of his creative efforts ever again hallelujah
