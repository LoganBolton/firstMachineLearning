the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you and even his friends really cant stand it is a pretty interesting concept film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la the problem is that it feels incredibly and badly scripted at times and blatantly selfpromoting it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writeractor is so egotistical uncool untrue and simply unlikeable you end up feeling sorry for his dates
