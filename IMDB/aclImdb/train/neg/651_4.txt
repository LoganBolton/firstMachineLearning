i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts i must admit i found it pretty decentuntil i started to think about what the characters were saying logical problemsbr br 1 her boyfriend who seems to be a pretty fit dude makes no sound while being killed dont you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer br br 2 when the remark is made that the gym teacher is soooo in love with lisa i almost screamed at the screen when your best friends family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her you dont make comments like that if you have half of a heartbr br 3 as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead wouldnt the smart thing to do be to get donna boyfriend aunt and uncle into a car and drive far far away then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no way to get outbr br i could go on and on and on basically the plot was decent the characters werent profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errorsbr br howeverbr br this movie might be good for teenagers or young couples just looking for a fun night out if you dont consider all the goofs its a mediocre film
