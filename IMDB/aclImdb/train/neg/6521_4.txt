im probably not giving this movie a fair shake as i was unable to watch all of it perhaps if id seen it in a theater in its original presentation i might have appreciated it but its far too slowmoving for mebr br i read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory this did not help the film as its something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of eventsbr br this is really four linked films or a film in four parts and was i believe intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation i found part i to be enjoyable enough but it was all i could do to sit through part ii which drags interminably reading tolstoys philosophizing is one thing if you get a good translation or can read it in the original his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story on film however its hard to reproduce without being ponderousbr br i have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw its very splashy with a lot of heymalookatthis camera work that calls attention to itself instead of serving to advance the storybr br clearly im missing something but i just couldnt summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts iii and iv
