please take a minute to read my entire review i am not knocking the film itself  only the dvd versions currently availablebr br br br i really wanted to give this film even two stars i mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10br br heres how an epic film adaptation of tolstoys novel war and peace with historically accurate battle scenes courtesy of the red army and an extremely faithful sceneforscene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours  if thats what you were seeingbr br the trouble is you cant see that film  anywhere as far as i knowbr br i am attempting to watch the ruscico dvd version  widely considered the best version available since its letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other dvd releases br br but it is one of the worst film prints ive ever seen transfered to dvd the picture is muddy and inconsistent often strobing its almost tolerable if you crank your brightness color and picture levels up to maximum but the problem doesnt end therebr br the sound is also way inconsistent blaringly loud in parts virtually inaudible in others br br and as for languages its a huge problem for english speakers  the dubbed option has some good actors and some really terrible ones whose performance grates and parts of the film just arent dubbed at all slipping back into russian and even french randomlybr br the subtitled option isnt much better the subtitles dont appear below the image but right over it  obscuring some of the beauty or whats left of it in the scenery furthermore the subtitles are often a poor translation a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to tolstoys actual words and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts br br so even if you max out the color brightness and picture settings and turn the volume way up and choose subtitled and english dubbed youre still going to get a film thats annoying to watch and listen tobr br can its content overcome that it might have been able to but at seven hours  who can stand it for that longbr br maybe someday someone will come along and restore this  and maybe then i will see a masterpiece  but for now i just cant give more than one star to something ive only been able to stand watching about the first 12 of
