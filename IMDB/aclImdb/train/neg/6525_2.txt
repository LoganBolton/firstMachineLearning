i gave this movie a 2 and though i consider myself a science fiction fan i found this movie very difficult to take seriously it was on amc one late night and im glad i saw it for free this movie is probably good for a few laughs but not much morebr br the special effects are about average for the time period  not awful but not great either of course we know more about mars now than we did back then but we really cant hold that against this film the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the storybr br there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail  the astronauts injurycondition the city on mars the creature in the lake etc overall the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of the outer limits  complete with a cheesy ending
