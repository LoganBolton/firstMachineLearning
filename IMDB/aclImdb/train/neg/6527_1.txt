surely no saturday morning tv kids show was ever done this poorly after all those producers had to count on the audience coming back well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets the script could have been a reject from some longforgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cooldude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along the spaceship props are absurda bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for examplebut the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history most are crude drawings and its all bathed in an often misfocused red light even mohrs bare hairy chest is used as a prop and its a bad oneas ribthin as the plot any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martiansand will probably agree completely
