this movie is funny and painful at the same time the cinemagic almost gave me a seizure despite what they imply cinemagic is not some innovative technical procedure it was developed as the result of an accident and they used it because it disguised the fact that their monsters were so stupidlooking i also dont think its a coincidence that the writer is sid pinkbr br this movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200000 dollars it is entertaining at least i can say that about it the batratspider is the highlight
