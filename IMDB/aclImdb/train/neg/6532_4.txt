the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet when its retrieved one of the crew members is ill one is alive and the other two are missing what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving memberbr br while on mars the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bugeyed monsters oddly while the sets were pretty good the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film plus in an odd attempt at realism the production used a process called cinemagic unfortunately this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleedit was that bad despite all the cheese the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel for lovers of the genre its well worth seeing for others you may just find the whole thing rather sillysee for yourself and decidebr br while by todays standards this isnt an especially good scifi film compared with the films being made at the time it stacks up pretty wellbr br pswhen you watch the film pay careful attention to dr tremayne he looks like the spitting image of dr quest from the jonny quest cartoon plus he sounds and acts a lot like him too
