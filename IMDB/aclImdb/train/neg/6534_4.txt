this scifi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst i agree with the statement that bad scifi is comical bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late late late show viewers space explorers on the planet mars fight off strange giant amoebalike monsters and other strange creatures pretty coolbr br the cast includes les tremayne naura hayden gerald mohr and jack kruschen get comfy and enjoy dont feel bad if you nod off for a moment i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss
