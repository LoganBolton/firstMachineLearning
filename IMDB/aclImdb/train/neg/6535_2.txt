a spaceship returns from mars about a couple of months earlier a 4person expedition had been sent to the red planet most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there the picture is saddled by inane melodramatic dialog typical of many scifi efforts of the fifties  sixties note for example how the ships commander mohr tells another crew member to stay there for no reason as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem later the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside the two he ordered to stay say no way and follow out i didnt have high hopes for the expeditions success by this point theres much talk of ears twitching and hugging a freezeray gun named cleo short for cleopatra of course it would at least be pretty funny unintentionally if the story didnt dragbr br theres a very slow pace to the whole thing the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ships window portals which change color from red to blue commenting on what they see as they do outside actually exploring the martian landscape advertised as filmed in cinemagic usually resembles animation cutouts or drawings shot through an orangered filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process but i dont think it fools anyone over 10 years old the one clever mention i did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista oh okaybr br i was amused by some of the astronauts actions as they begin to explore right off the bat they test their freeze gun on a plant killing it just for the hell of it then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spiderrat monster nice going lady look up next time no wonder the intelligence on mars gets upset and doesnt mind that one of the lower lifeforms a giant amoeba attacks the explorers the acting isnt too impressive mohr especially had a very annoying technique saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out  reminded me of it the terror from beyond space the ending is fairly anticlimactic dont expect any huge revelations beyond the no more expeditions with freeze guns named cleo
