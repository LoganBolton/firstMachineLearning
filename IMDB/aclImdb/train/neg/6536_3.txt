this dvd appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background its organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream musicbr br unfortunately the td music is dull and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim too expensive a dvd for what it is
