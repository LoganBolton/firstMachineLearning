first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english  which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however ill rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movies atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie im sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didnt see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a 1 what can i say us oriented tastes maybe
