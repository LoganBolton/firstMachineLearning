if this could be rated a 0 it would be from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull plodding pace the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers this is a disaster of a filmbr br the plot is predictable as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence from a boring unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending every single presence in this film is wasted and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squanderedbr br if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation watch one of the ilsa films at least theyre unapologetic and upfront about what theyre trying to do how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposesbr br its not scary its not interesting and above all its not arousing in any sense of the word it is in my opinion a crime it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewersbr br not even elviras cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is avoid it at all costs
