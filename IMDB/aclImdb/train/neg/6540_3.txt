i cant believe that so many are comparing this movie to argentos his work is far more imaginative and viciousand a lot more funbr br the director simply lacks the ability to build real tension the murder scenesand lets face it thats what this genre is all aboutarent interesting it was not hard to guess who the murderer was and i really didnt care when it was revealed the cinematography isnt memorable and the muchpraised 19th century gothic atmosphere just didnt draw me in several of the actors are quite good especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students but theyre given very little to dobr br yes there are undertones of incest sadomasochism and lesbianism but amazingly they add very little spice or suspense br br if youre looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere
