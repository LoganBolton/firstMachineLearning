well you might not actually see any women in love in this movie but youll certainly hear women talking about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plantsbr br welcome to the world of dh lawrence where psychobabble reigns supreme and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are spending time with the characters in a dh lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most selfabsorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party when i read women in love i so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it but since i couldnt i was hoping they would at least strangle each other alas only one of them dies not by strangulation and i wont spoil it for you by telling which one in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these peoplebr br to give director ken russell his due he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as its possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel he throws out much of the psychological mumbojumbo that lawrence adored and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields two buck naked men wrestling by firelight and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates yup buck naked again roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass im not kidding glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as gudrun the more dominant of the two sisters at the storys focus and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear russells decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystifiedlooking cattle oliver reed has one expression an intense glower the whole thing is overwritten and overdirected and its deliriously campy indeed this vies with mommie dearest as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie ive ever seenbr br grade d
