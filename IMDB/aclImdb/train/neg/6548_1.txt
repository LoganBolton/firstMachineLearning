if youre watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about then youre in for quite the surprise even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline but the actual film is anything butbr br as the synopsis went it tells of an obsessed mountain climber which youll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl which tells you of the presence of chronopolis an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind note to self Â– this spells trouble with flashing lights where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence they can see our world and notice of all persons this mountain climber and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy creating an intelligent sphere to meet the manbr br what that translated to is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce have shapes created though credit goes to the stop motion style and put it through a mindnumbing loop and repeat until your eyes start to close then move on to the next scene if anything the chonopolisians if this term exists really love their sticks and balls constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the other world it gets no better as well when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequencebr br thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than whats advertised which is 57 minutes or less against the 70 stated while firmly dated its dull colours nonexistent story scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans dont waste time
