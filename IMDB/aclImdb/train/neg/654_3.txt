prom night is a titleonly remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen this movie takes place in an oregon town where donna brittany snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years she and her friends arrive at the prom which is taking place in a grand hotel and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives little does anyone know a man from donnas past who has haunted her for years is also at the prom and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of herbr br im a fan of the original prom night so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie but i have to admit i was quite disappointed prom night suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have and that is predictability there are absolutely no surprises here and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times often better before what does this equate to for the audience boredom unless of course you have never seen any horror movies or are part of the preteen crowd but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen the plot is simplistic but the entire script is void of any type of surprise twist atmosphere or anything and this really really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into it all just seemed very blandbr br a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg13 slasher movie as well and i understand what they are saying but i dont think its impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore take carpenters halloween for example  little to no on screen violence but still an extremely frightening and effective movie you dont need gore to make a film scary but even had prom night been gratuitously violent which it is not it is very tame it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with the tension and suspense here is mild at best and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations and was correct about 99 of the time our characters arent well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them and their bythenumbers demises are routine and carelessbr br i will point out a few things i did like about this movie though because it wasnt completely useless  the cinematography is really nice and everything was very wellfilmed and fairly stylish among the jump scares that are for the most part very predictable there were a few that were kind of clever the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold however predictable the unfolding may be as for the acting its mediocre at best brittany snow plays the lead decently but really the rest of the cast doesnt show off much talent johnathan schaech plays the villain and is probably the most experienced performer here but even he isnt that impressive however i did like the character he played which was a nice change from the typical maskedstalker type killer we see a lot as far as the ending goes the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wits end and it was very anticlimacticbr br overall prom night was a disappointment everything was very bythenumbers routine and predictable which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie there were a few neat moments but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere and had little plot development nor believable characters id advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till its out on video or rent the original instead because there are absolutely no surprises here some may find a little entertainment in it but it was far too predictable for my tastes i expected better and left the theater very disappointed 310
