really they spelled it brain in the credits not brianbr br ok they didnt have the budget for a spell checker all the production money went for great old cars there are at least two packards visible here one is a darin convertible a nice yellow packard convertiblebr br the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations old cameras an exterior of ciros street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there poorly written and directedbr br my dvd says it runs for 104 minutes approximately it was more like 85 minutes it came to an end without reaching a conclusion there was a collision but no conclusion the movie just smashed up against the credits 99 cents for this i paid 99 cents for this i could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cats face as he emoted more excitementbr br for a few seconds in the ciros scene after darren mcgavin gets a phone call it looked like maybe this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film then it just sat therebr br the young latin actor played by steven bauer tony montoya could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here this cast could have made a good filmbr br i think if they cut brians part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the packards and lose the band and add a johnny otis sound alike band then they got somethingbr br here kitty kittybr br tom willett
