i went into this with my hopes up by twenty minutes into the movie i couldnt have been more let down despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake i kept my hopes high that maybejust maybe someone would get it right this time around sadly prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake bad script bad direction cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horrorbr br from beginning to end its boring repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls weve seen it all before and weve seen it done a million times better then this if you go to see prom night in the theater id say wait for the dvd or ppv get ready for the audience to laugh because laugh they will the laughs arent at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny they are in response to key thrilling moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie seriously was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof the film makers missed the mark so badly here that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie which in retrospect i wish i had done not me though i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better needless to say it didnt the horror scenes are a joke not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction the script the special effects and the camera work the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it but still came out of it with a micro budget movie i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere br br this movies scary alright if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed
