you can tell a lew grade production a mile off  distinctly british in style epic in conception peopled by international allstar casts usually set in exotic climes its a formula that grade and his company itc employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s resulting in titles like the eagle has landed firepower and raise the titanic in 1977 grade produced march or die a remarkably oldfashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above directed by the usually dependable dick richards  who helmed the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier  march or die is an unfortunate disappointmentbr br a company of foreign legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian general foster gene hackman is sent to morocco shortly after world war 1 their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated francois marneau max von sydow the archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of erfoud but fear an attack from arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group foster is not happy with the assignment  he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives this creates ongoing tension between himself and marneau who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible the problems heighten when a beautiful woman named simone picard catherine deneuve tags along with the legionnaires she is hoping to find out what happened to her father a historian abducted by the arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires none more so than gypsy thief marco segrain terence hill a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature things climax with a huge battle at erfoud with swarms of united arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their livesbr br on paper the star duo of gene hackman and terence hill seem a mismatch  hackman is the heavyweight oscarwinning character actor hill the handsome but limited italian heartthrob from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen yet bizarrely it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels the film is attractively shot on desert locations but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for maurice jarres music is uncommonly flat too  very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of arabia score it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an oldfashioned adventure of this type in the 70s it was a genre that peaked in the 30s and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades sadly the gamble doesnt really pay off  this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march
