bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida where he meets a little penquin which he tries to save from an eskimo this short tries and the penquin is adorable but in the end its a bit too light in the laughs department the eskimo isnt really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly even other shorts when hes paired with other unknown antagonists so i cant in good conscience recommend this one however it is nice to see it in its uncut form this cartoon is on disk 3 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 br br my grade c
