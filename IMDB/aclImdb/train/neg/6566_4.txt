i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare and i have to say it did not deserve itbr br parinda was so hyped that i was really looking forward to watch itbr br parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian filmmakers despite having a great story it was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original it was loosely based on the classic on the waterfrontbr br anil kapoor was irritating especially when he comes from america the direction lacked quality many a times except a few inbetween scenesbr br give this script to any of them  ram gopal verma deepa mehta mahesh bhatt sudhir mishra and im 100 sure theyll make a mindblowing movie out of itbr br im not saying parinda was bad it was just not good enough
