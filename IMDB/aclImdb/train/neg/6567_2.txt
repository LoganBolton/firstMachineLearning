i went into this movie hoping for the best i like wartime musicals in general dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles however the writers gave them boring dialog the loveinterest between the two of them was not given any real growth just suddenly it was there i did not think much of the music the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with der fuhrers face the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy pretty tame stuffeven with the monkey bert lahrs comedy skits were interminablebr br there were parts to enjoy lucille ball was quite a looker and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen
