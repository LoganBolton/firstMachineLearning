note i couldnt force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night it just cant be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the moviebr br things that i thought about while watching prom night br br im so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach didnt the whole its just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate deathbr br the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clich√©s on two hands not a good signbr br even after just meeting the protagonists boyfriend im convinced he will die anybody want to place bets br br the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna by the way does anybody think that donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no accounting for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donnabr br high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesnt keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasnt in place the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the tradeoff for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything ive already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money i have in my wallet and im only in the 20 minute mark how else will i entertain myself br br note to self dont forget milk and bread on the way homebr br dear screenwriter youve used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this yearbr br the 1980 version of this film wasnt that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many posthalloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish shed act morebr br apparently at prom there isnt much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these colleges being brought up by name and i cant help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get inbr br the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes thats the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle on another side note this is a very lazy killer michael myers went hunting after his victims just sayingbr br its official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what triggered it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee or was it brittany snows unconvincing performance ill have to say it was all of the abovebr br okay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the potbr br finally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasnt too smart thats the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week long power outage is a slight inconveniencebr br i cant wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring reviewbr br i cant recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater patrons alcohol isnt servedbr br rating  out of
