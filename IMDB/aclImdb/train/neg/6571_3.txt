while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is its a shame as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasnt funny films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy are very good chase films so he could be really funny given good material unfortunately in this film hes given absolutely nothing even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isnt any help because the basic premise boy wants to marry girl but girls father thinks the boy is a wuss and the gags are so poor its a shame as i really wanted to love this film but couldntbr br by the way for those used to the look for charley from the mid1920s on youll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustacheand looks very little like youd expect
