prom night 2008br br directed by nelson mccormickbr br starring brittany snow scott porter jessica stroup and dana davisbr br plot three years ago donna brittany snow witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher jonathan schaech who has a bit of a crush on her now she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends once there they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt br br pros i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character movesbr br an examplebr br everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her she doesnt seem that great has escaped from prison their reason they dont want to embarrass her in front of all her friends lolbr br cons let me start off by saying im a huge slasher fan usually i can have fun with even the bad ones i even like some pg13 horror films tourist trap 1979 one of my favorites was originally rated pg i also enjoy poltergeist 1982 and the grudge 2004 so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the moviebr br first of all i had a big problem with the story i like slasher films that dont even have stories at least they can be entertaining this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student so he kills her entire family a few years later he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends  then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about claire jessica stroup is fighting with her boyfriend she has cramps and i couldnt care less this should have been a lifetime feature not a remake of prom night br br and then  this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes i dont even care that its not that gory some of my favorite slashers halloween curtains the original prom night were not that gory but they still had effective murders here we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds and a closeup on a bad actors face as he screams in agony im sure that 10 yearold girls were terrified but not mebr br i also hated the characters there was donnas unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby scott porter and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life unless you are a gay male then we had donnas annoying friends claire stroup and lisa dana davis and the token mean girl chrissy brianne davis if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying try watching this movie and dont get me started on ronnie collins pennie and the dj jay phillips who gave me flashbacks to ushers performance in shes all thatbr br add to all that predictable plot turns a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material and you have quite a stinker
