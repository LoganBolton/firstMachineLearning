geez another lifetime movie but once again isnt exactly the worst movie in the world but far from the best i think the main problem is that its pretty obvious who is responsible for what and its generally fairly predictable worse yet some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing and the viewer is left wondering okay how much am i supposed to care one thing i did like is that the movie goes to show you that its never that simple as the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad and sometimes it is evil vs evil rather than good vs evil hadley didnt do what she did out of a sense of justice she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family and to eliminate the competition as for alicia it simply proves that a victim isnt always a good person some of them really do have it coming even if it was a painful horrible death the burning bed is a great example of this but the difference is that the vile man in the burning bed got exactly what he deserved but did alicia have it coming some will say that she did but others dont agree and the law generally doesnt eitherbr br as for acting its a mixed bag some do a good job like mia but others just came across as indifferent to their roles they were mostly wooden or simply not convincing the music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy especially if you like girlgirl action the movie isnt badly shot at all but given its glaring weaknesses the strengths are in background unfortunatelybr br ive heard rumors of a sequel but given the years i doubt itll happen but i wouldnt be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared if alicia is as evil conniving and horrible as people say then i dont think shell be thinking yay i woke up from a coma oh hadley was responsible oh thats okay i totally forgive her and want the charges dropped no way hadley would be in jail for long anyway if she even does any time since no murder actually happened br br anyway worth checking out at least once
