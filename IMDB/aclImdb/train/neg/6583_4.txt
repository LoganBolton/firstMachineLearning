interesting idea and storyline which didnt quite workbr br when you see the film maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as i did i didnt really know who to root for in the movie taye diggs looked bored as the detective the rest of the characters seem so onedimensional and unpleasantbr br if the victim aliciamia kirschner had been more of a nice girl we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead i cant understand the moral message of this film and as a detective story and thriller it doesnt work
