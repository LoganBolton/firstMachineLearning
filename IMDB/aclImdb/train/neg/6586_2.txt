if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror dont bother with gawi the film scarcely deserves mention alongside alist work such as ringu a tale of two sisters cure and juon or even such good material as the eye or inner senses those films brim with subtleties unexpected imagery rich characters and a decidedly nonwestern take on whats frightening gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twentyfive yearsbr br the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick but its a bad fit one aesthetic is bound to smother the other guess which having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evilchild subplot but the situation is hopeless clich√©s crap characters witless plotting a dull ghost ho hum
