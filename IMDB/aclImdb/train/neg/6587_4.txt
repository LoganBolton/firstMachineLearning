we see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl but whatever he tries they wont stay open after this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences so is she back from the grave seeking revenge br br oh what a great and always spooky story well thats what i hoping i could say and hoping was as good as it got this is an forgettable soso supernatural horror flick that i actually watched before but i went in thinking it was my first viewing so to my surprise it hit me when i started picking up on certain things but like i said its quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again nightmare is just another type of its field that adds a few changes to the gruel oh please give me something thats a bit more fresh it doesnt have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired jhorror flick even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed rightÂ… an evil looking vengeful chick spiritbr br but in spite of my negativity of it being the same old same old story and jolts this one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals the deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality while the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with its murky lighting the first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one bloodcurdling experience but really when its not trying to shock you i found it rather coma inducing and i thought about getting some shuteye that might be harsh but it just didnt go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments you could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a selfcentred bunch that you dont really care what happens to them the disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship it just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax its just plain ludicrous the films haunting ending is a high point thoughbr br the film looks fine although it could have done without the snazzy quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood the performances tread a fine line but gyuri kim is strong in the lead rolebr br its nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills although i found the handling of it rather lethargic despite the odd effective chills a standard effort all round i guess but still its equally missable
