im afraid that i didnt like this movie very much apart from a few saving graces its nothing to write home about br br jhorror has boomed for the last fivesix years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success this is one of thembr br basically this is a supernatural slasher movie the beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together but soon after opens them however after that its quickly downhill for this flickbr br to be kind i will start with the things i like about gawi on the plus side the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for its type for those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed no pun intended murder scenes we also get a few good suspense sequencessetpiecesbr br however there are quite a few drawbacks alsobr br first of all and my major complaint about this movie is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity usually thats not a problem for me but here where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are i was confused on more than one occasionbr br the performances are okay i guess a little hard to tell when you dont know the language but seem a little stiff and for a horror movie i dont think it was scary enough for a while i was quite bored actuallybr br being a fan of giallo movies i was expecting quite a lot from nightmare but unfortunately i was quite disappointed
