i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other peoples opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies ive ever seenbr br the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear im amazed there werent any group hug  momentsbr br i think i jumped once and thats because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clich√©d birdscat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happenbr br and the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my moms shawl you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my moms shawl that didnt match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived godbr br my friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet hes hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhops clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and its the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies arent even this predictablebr br im gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie im glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldnt buy it for 1500 and then hate it it was just bad it wouldve been better if only one thing wouldve happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that wouldve beenbr br dont waste your time or money go see a good movie
