the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out bad idea this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends the story is stupid mix two parts ringu with one part prom night a sprinkle of i know what you did last summer and add a tiny dash of single white female  now blend until completely nonsensical there is nothing new to this plot and revisiting the clich√©s ive grown so fond of wasnt even entertaining this time this movie jumps to and from the past too much and once i made sense of it all i realized it still didnt make much sense characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye speaking of characters they are all your stereotypical favorites  the greedy selfish lawyer the egocentric actress the hasbeen baseball star the video voyeur the bitter girl the spooky quiet chick the nicerthannice nice girl a freakin black cat and i didnt care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess i should also mention a certain video tape that would have been impossible to shoot br br this movie isnt the worst asian horror has to offer by far but it is still pretty bad if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting or just want to yell youre stupid at a movie screen or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many youve seen  this movie is for you br br those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere
