brief summary this movie demeans everyone it touches that means youbr br first off let me say im not a purist and this might have been funny for a few minutes the impersonations are not bad but overall its just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over againbr br its clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the nowtrademarked laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the mostbr br of course my daughter liked it so im also a failure as a parent
