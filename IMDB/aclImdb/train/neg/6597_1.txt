this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the 60s they were terrible but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence new audiences had rediscovered the pairs comedic genius and the cartoons were mindnumbing garbage geared to cash in on childrens interest it was to be expected but how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of i cant even think of a word im sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival but you cant inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing the impressionists i hesitate to call them actors do a vegas act and thats where it belongs the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out tworeel ideas for a feature if this film was someones first exposure to the real laurel and hardy im sure that viewer would dismiss the original duos reputation as senility gone amok the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave and you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie
