who was george c scott george c scott was a renowned actor practically any movie that hes been in is the better off for it now ol george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie but he once said something that describes said movie to a tbr br i dont recall his exact words but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting but great acting cannot save bad writing never has this little observation been truer than in the all new adventures of laurel  hardy for love or mummybr br the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect bronson pinchot laurel and gailard sartain hardy not only look the parts but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal mannerisms and all this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents that said this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to you guessed it writingbr br aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain which was very in character and a brief gag involving a taxi this movie is an absolute chore to sit throughbr br problem  1 too much time and effort went into the plotbr br i dont want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady what i want is to see stan and ollie or at least their standins way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the notveryfunny secondary characters that said plot revolved aroundbr br however even if this movie had been all jokes that would still leave us withbr br problem  2 most of the jokes are what i would call watereddown slapstick br br what do i mean by watered downbr br in slapstick a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ala looney tunes 3 stoogesor how about laurel  hardybr br in watereddown slapstick as i define it a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effectbr br maybe an illustration would helpbr br in looney tunes daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd his bill falls off and he puts it back on that is classic slapstickbr br in this gem ollie accidentally bumps into some people they turn around tell him to be careful and continue on their merry way thats not slapstick thats not even funny thats justboringand this movie is full of these kinds of jokes its as though theyre this movies bread and butter the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like theyre supposed to be funny granted the example i just gave is the most extreme case but i can only cut it so much slackbr br long story short the film just doesnt work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchots and sartains abilities to impersonate stan and ollie instead the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work withbr br not a good movie but an incredible sleeping aidbr br i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal just so long as you steer clear of atoll k and be big
