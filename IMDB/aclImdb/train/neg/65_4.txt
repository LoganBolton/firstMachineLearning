i dont quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10 what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes there are so many clich√©s in that flick the womens hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake theres no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors overacting over any limits that it hurts its not funny enough to be a comedy its too fakesad to really touch so in my eyes its just not good watching it i couldnt believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland but maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation who knows definitely one of the oddest movies ive ever seen and this certainly not in a good way sorry
