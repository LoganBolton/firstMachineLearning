yowza if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it youre a better person than me this movie while a great attempt at imitating laurel and hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance i blame larry harmon dialogue is torn from old lh movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless costars pinchots accent was bizarre for stan and while sartain did an excellent job with ollies accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr hardy where was a good musical number editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are implausable although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets and overall its a terrible thing to witness its even more painful to watch than atoll k where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950s era writing and photography do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can and learn how things were you know what a magnate is dont you stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semimoronic quips at every sentencebr br i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent updatehonor of the boys where was the classic theme song why ruin heres another fine mess why skip any the wiser why was there a pointless gaggle of costars why miss gulch from the wizard of oz why must larry harmon be in it why bozo and did the learning channel help fund the thingbr br i mean really fart jokes for gods sakebr br fart jokes
