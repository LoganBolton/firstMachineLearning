for the life of me i cant figure out why anyone would make a movie like this the plot is tired the acting is strained the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the f word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so lets throw in another couple of fs for good measure thats what the american public wants to hear gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part forget this cp rent shrek and have a good laugh
