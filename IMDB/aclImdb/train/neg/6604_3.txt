the first one was the best the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible although the storyline wasnt so bad in fact all story lines are good and bad throughout the movie i dosed off a few times i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise but not a good actor in rush hour 2 chris tucker too wasnt good and zhang ziyi what can i say a few lines terrible acting but thats based on her script all the characters there were not that good but some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes i know that jackie chan doesnt do those things which is good for him
