designed only to annoy or amuse any selfrespecting intelligent person if the directors intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director whod make a critique of americas promarxist 60s movement especially not a filmmaker from the 70s there is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes i wondered if i wasnt actually watching a comedy you wouldnt be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  thats how naïve the movie appears spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons but i mean arent they all nice boobs but st for brains
