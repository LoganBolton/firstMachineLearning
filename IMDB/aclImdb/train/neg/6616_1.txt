i must tell you right up front i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful however if youve never seen one dont start with this one i have greatly enjoyed the ones ive seen up until this one but i just couldnt stand this one i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this filmit was that annoying so why was it so annoying br br 1 there is a character named rambha in the film he is even more annoying than jarjar binkswhich i never would have believed would have been possible he is so  annoying he spoke in a falsetto voice and i think was meant to be comic relief instead he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to dieslowly his voice his mannerisms and his obnoxiousnesshe just didnt seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was inand he needed to die br br 2 the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge ak47 bullets with ease i kid you notthere was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles and again and again they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the ruffians this made stallones actions in rambo ii look mundane br br 3 the film was so goshdarn loud in your face and intenseit practically made my brain bleed it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth crazy camera angles intense music and action action actionthis movie is clearly designed for someone who cant take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100 actionbr br 4 the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sensenone whatsoever br br perhaps if you are the most ardent action and bollywood fan you can stand this film but as for me i can see why its on imdbs infamous bottom 100 list wowthis film is bad and intensely bad
