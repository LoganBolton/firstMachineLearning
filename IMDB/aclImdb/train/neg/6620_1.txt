i cant come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror i felt sitting in that cinema watching ramgopal varma ki aag the directors halfhearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic bollywood western sholay the biggest problem with varmas remake is that he doesnt even try to make a credible film its evident in every single frame of this movie that varmas heart is just not in it what you see on screen is a bad joke at best a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims hes been a fan of all his lifeive seen several bad films over the years but i cant remember one thats been as much of a torture to sit through as this one consider yourself very brave if youre able to survive the entire film because it tests your patience like few films have beforevarma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film but his version is trite and hollow and doesnt have any of the spirit and energy of sholay ramgopal varma ki aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not  wayoverthetop toolongtooboring and entirely mindless muchloved moments from sholay are parodied by varma and for that you want to wring his neck one of the most memorable scenes in sholay in which dharmendra as veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with ajay devgan playing hero pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself how you wish hed pulled the trigger and spared us all the agonynot only does ramgopal varma ki aag fail as a remake of sholay its a pretty bad effort even as a standalone film the eardrumdamaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen and the camerawork alternates between dramatic and headspinning partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the films mostly deadaswood actors sushmita sen as devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously punctuating her lines with pauses staring into camera for effect and generally performing like her life depends upon it mohanlal as narsimha struggles with his hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career newcomer prashant raj playing jaiequivalent raj has no acting chops to speak of and cant strum up any of the brooding intensity amitabh bachchan brought to the part in the original filmas hero the newage veeru ajay devgan is entirely hopeless failing miserably in his attempts at comedy but the films weakest link easily the most shocking casting decision is nisha kothari as ghunghroo who steps into the shoes of hema malini as basanti the endearing airhead from sholay nisha kothari is not only the worst actress in this country but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time shes on screen and then there is amitabh bachchan playing babban singh ramgopal varmas version of hindi cinemas most popular villain gabbar singh the only actor in this ensemble who recognises the films overthetop tone and plays along accordingly bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch hes meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams and he does all of that to good effect but because hes trapped in such a doomed enterprise his performance doesnt really help elevate the film in any wayno surprises here im going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for ramgopal varma ki aag it ones of those painful moviewatching experiences you wouldnt subject even an enemy to its not like varma hasnt handled a remake before with sarkar he gave us a smart gripping take on the godfather and its a pity hes made this sholay bhature out of such a muchloved classic ramgopal varma ki aag is his worst career decision ever its also a dark spot on his resume hell be embarrassed of forever i suspect this film will go down in movie history as ramgopal varma ka daag
