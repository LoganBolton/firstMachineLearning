i like many other bachchan fans having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay this movie was not it thank god they didnt let them use the name sholay in the movie title ram gopals remake is not worthy of the title the camera work the locations the costumes the totally outofplace dancing the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast the only nonpaid actor the ant was the only resemblance to the first movie abisheks role was totally ridiculous did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash save your money your mind and your time dont bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out
