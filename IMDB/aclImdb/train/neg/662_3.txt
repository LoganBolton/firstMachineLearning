and rent a good horror movie its like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didnt realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like scream and scary moviebr br in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written stupid were going to the prom junk i wanted to claw my ears off honestly the hills has better dialogbr br there really was no need to make this movie leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking her really guy is obsessed with her really br br all the characters act in stupid ways including the police cover the place in teams of 2 front and back not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed br br the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem no resistance from victims or doors nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door the people are like mentally disabled sheepbr br by the by if youre a gore fan youll be disappointed too all the killing is kept offscreen and is  ahem  tastefully done so boo hoo for you br br none of the killings is the least bit interesting most of the time theyve already happened by the time we find outbr br the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies oh kitty you scared me i thought you were the killer  aiieeee br br and then at the end when its time for the killer to die  well lets just say its the easiest and most obvious choice snorebr br the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough dont encourage this kind of lazy filmmakingbr br oh and by the way  no crowning of a prom king or queen no tiara no bucket of blood br br so save your money and rent carrie or friday the 13th or halloween or scream or scary movie any of them to get a good scare with some original twists
