what on earth has become of our dear ramu is this the same man who made sarkar satya and comapny i refuse to believe so if aag was ramus most ambitious project he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times this movie is made to fall like a brick i was cringing to leave the theater but i was forced to sit because i wouldnt have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left else nothing would have made me sit beyond intervalbr br this movie is nowhere close to sholay it doesnt even come near it within a mile i believe ramu surely loves the godfather more than sholay since sarkar was a classic piece of work i read ramus interview a couple of days back in which the interviewer said that ramu doesnt sleep for more than 4 hours a day that too not at a stretch i completely agree with this now as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the moviebr br there is no power in the performance amitabh bachchan doesnt even look scary he looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers i saw earlier ramus favorite nisha kothari did a fantastic job in sarkar because she didnt have many dialogs in fact none if i remember clearly she opened her mouth in this movie and has found a place in history the new guy playing jais role seems to have that brash look but didnt manage jais role at all i cant go on im sorry my pain is too big for me to manage right nowbr br i promised myself throughout the movie that i will watch the original sholay once more just to see that it is still therebr br bottom line horrible movie the media and critics are going to cook ramus goose and just to remind all readers once more i am one of the biggest ramu fans and even i cant spare him for this act
