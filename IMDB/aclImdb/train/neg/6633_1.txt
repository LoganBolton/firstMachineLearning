where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie isbr br lets start with the campy hick humor it isnt very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors  meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this moviebr br and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they wantbr br and then just when the movie should end they cant come up with a more plausible last scene than a  well i wont ruin it for you if you really want to see the moviebr br there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me  and he has a more prominent role thats a sure sign that the movie probably wont be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations  even exceeds them by being worse than poorbr br lets just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie
