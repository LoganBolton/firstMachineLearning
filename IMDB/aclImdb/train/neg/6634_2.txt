the first look on the cover of this picture it looks like a good rock n roll movie but dont let the cover fool you or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it the storyline is just horrible and so is the acting plain and simple badbr br its not a movie about a roadie its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it the only good thing about this movie is the soundtracksome good songs and that is why i give 2 out of 10 if it wasnt for the music it would of been 0 out of 10 meat loaf is a horrible actorat least he was in 1980 and the girl who plays the groupie isnt even good looking this movie was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises
