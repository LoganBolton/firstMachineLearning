some of the worst least natural acting performances ive ever seen which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky lame dialog given to the one note characters add to that the cheap production values and youve got a movie that doesnt look like it even belongs on television one doesnt expect much from a lifetime movie especially one this old but this is nearly unwatchably badbr br plotwise its a dreadful clich√©d romance of a type even harlequin would consider beneath them its possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes surprise the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love
