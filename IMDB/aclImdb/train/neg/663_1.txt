imagine the scenario  you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and its raining and youre finished with the museums you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you dont have to engage your brain its sold out options  the bank job in bruges the leatherheads or prom night youve seen the bank job suprisingly decent heist movie that and in bruges again pretty good so youre down to two you dont fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the 850 walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for 850 it would be money better spentbr br it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horrorthriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldnt know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyones intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen ben affleck and hayden christansan i hate his acting so much i dont care how you spell his name you are relieved on your titles br br so in summary not good
