a drama at its very core anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away anna is a character that believes america is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong  but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesnt believe in she is hardnosed optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice anna flipflops between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience anna has been praised for its star sally kirkland and her ability to get grungy for the role but a month into 2008 anna does not remain a staple of film culture it is dated dull and formulaically chaoticbr br director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within anna about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia both politically and socially but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is kirkland you remember if it isnt obvious this film didnt sit well with me from the opening of the first act and deep within the second anna felt like a high school theater production the characters were nonexistent there was no enlightening prestory and there was no definition of time or place there was sally kirkland stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls it is emotionally boring and unbelievable again randomly we meet annas boyfriend daniel played by the weak robert fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character  only to boost the attention onto kirklands anna through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads  and sally kirkland arg it pains me to continue to say this but anna could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna daniel and krystina but instead we are forced into a onesided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plotbr br is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beautyless role in monster or halle berry in monsters ball was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction throughout this film i was disgusted by kirklands portrayal of anna and bogayeviczs lack of excitement for anything else fluent bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesnt work hard for her parts doesnt care for others and is generally mean spirited  yet we are to feel sympathy for her near the beginning of the film she forces what she wants to do onto others and gets upset when she doesnt get her way sure aging actresses my have that appeal to them but kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one that is where anna could have improved if this was a mature kirkland i would have gobbled it up but this stammering childish anna was impossible to believe while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd makeout characters and the film burns this scene is also one of my least favorite anna has made a phenomenal life for herself creating films and building the dream yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight she gets jealous and outraged this didnt make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer the outrageous overthe top wardrobe and the displaced ending where did that come from and what happened  anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema it was a showpiece an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time in this one it worked but i dont think i will be fooled againbr br overall i cannot say that i was impressed with this film anna is not a film about an aging film star it is about sally kirkland and only sally kirkland bogayevicz tries to do more with the story but fails either because kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isnt enough to support a full story there are one or two decent scenes in this film but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe tear up for or dedicate a sunday afternoon with  he created an annoyance kirkland wasnt anna she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides perhaps i missed the scope of this film but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved that wasnt the case here in anna kirkland orders daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the entire emotional scene i couldnt help but think that was what kirkland was like to those on the set she didnt make this into a film she transformed it into her own production and because of it anna failed i cannot suggest this to anyone  from one czech to another  skip it br br grade  ½ out of  for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out
