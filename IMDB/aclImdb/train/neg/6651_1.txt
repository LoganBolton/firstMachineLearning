this is absolutely the worst movie ive seen all yearbr br first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the castbr br this was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a selfcentered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippersbr br this was worse than watching a car wreck
