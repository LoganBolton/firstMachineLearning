this was a strange kind of film about a lowlifes in new york city and centering around a main character the title name played by brad pitt who thinks hes a ricky nelsontype musician except he has no real talent br br its kind of fun to watch until a profane tough new york citytype woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over that ruined the film for me it must have been catherine keener who usually plays tough and garbagemouthed women br br the hairdo on pitt  an exaggerated pompadour  was fun to look at i can picture johnny depp playing this role better one last note it odd to hear a film made in 1992 other than woody allens with just mono sound
