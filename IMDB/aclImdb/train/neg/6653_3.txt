i just saw this movie and i have to say that it was a big waste of time the girl who played eva ellen fjaestad cant act at all she read her lines very unnaturally and she had a very unnatural facial expression through the entire movie rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand is a natural she played her part with great perfectionbr br spoilers the story was simple  weve seen it many many times before she breaks up he finds another she get jealous he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end there were no surprises at all one knew that eva would break up and that adam would hook up with petra the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party she became all serious which is a side of petra the viewers hadnt seen earlier in the movie and told him to win evas heart back which was really cutebr br besides rosanna munter there isnt a single actor who gives a memorable performancebr br this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors so i dont recommend it
