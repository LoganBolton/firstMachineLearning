this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i cant give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other i probably wouldnt say anything that everyone else didnt say alreadybr br the only other thing about this show is that its pretty nasty with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and hes the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air its always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick im getting really really tired of stuff like this
