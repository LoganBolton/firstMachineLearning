there are some redeeming qualities to this show one is that the theme tune does have a decent melody the show does have a nice premise also i am probably in the minority but i like wanda i like the fact she is caring and is more a mother figure to timmy however despite all this i do not like this show it isnt excrement but i do find it very annoyingbr br i wouldnt say that it is the best animated show on planet earth when i use that term for an animated tv show i think of peter pan and the pirates i think of darkwing duck i think of scooby doo and i think of talespin and i hope i am not the only one who really likes the wild thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at nor do i think fairly odd parents is the worst animated show on planet earth i accept its annoying and in some ways overrated but it isnt the worst show on nickolodean that is chalk zone god that show is unwatchable but the worst animated show ive ever seen is shaggy and scooby dooget a clue which is crudely animated unfunny and frankly a disgracebr br one thing i dont like about this show is the animation the characters forgive me if i offend have very weird facial features and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make spongebob squarepants and wild thornberrys so nice to look at the characters with the exception of wanda i find very annoying i cant believe such a talented voice actress like tara strongaka charendoff voiced timmy timmy i dont find very likable as a lead character at all he is annoying and sometimes patronising and he is a poor decision maker as well and his voice gets on my nerves i actually like strong but not in this show another annoying character is cosmo the supposedly funny character instead his jokes are as unfunny as they could become they are either a contrived or b over familiar timmys parents are awful characters who dont give a toss about their son and their personalities wear well thinbr br the story lines are very unoriginal on the most part and i keep thinking where have i seen this before the episodes after the arrival of the baby i thought were unwatchable even worse is the scripts very unfunny childish witless and suffer from a complete lack of energybr br all in all not the worst show ever but pretty poor for an animation fan and fairly uncomfortable to sit through 310 there are redeeming qualities and i completely understand if people like it bethany cox
