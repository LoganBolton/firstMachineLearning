spoilers and extreme bashing lay aheadbr br when this show first started i found it tolerable and fun fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked it also had high ratings along with spongebob but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the showbr br first off toilet humor isnt all that funny you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp but thats pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke next there are the kiddie jokes lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people crossdressing lololol i just cant stop laughing at such gay bliss somebody help me but of course this show wouldnt suck that bad if it werent for stereotypes did you see how the team portrayed australians they saw them as nothing but kangarooloving boomerangthrowing simpletons who live in a hot desert but now is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all overused jokes the show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever cosmo is mostly the one to blame i hated how they kept on mentioning super toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and cosmo would freak out and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one email episode you know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kids room yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s to othersbr br if im not mistaken i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show thank god everyone around my area says its like the funniest nickelodeon show ever i just cant agree with it i think its just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse
