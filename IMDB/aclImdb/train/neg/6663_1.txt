i cannot stand this show has there ever been even one redeeming quality one funny punchline or one plot line that didnt make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes br br the voices oh those horrible wretched voices akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill nasal vocals cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew and timmys dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host guy smiley from sesame street comes to mindbr br the animation is awful even the producers of yugioh laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show every character has buck teeth or a square head or a head three sizes too big for his or her body and whats with having the characters speak every single line wideeyed and grinning as though posing for a photo op with the president then there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic not since the subtle grace of amelia bedelia homer simpson and buddy lembeck of charles in charge fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb usually unrealistic is synonymous with unfunny and that is most definitely the case here there hasnt been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since the naked gun 33 13and at least leslie nielson was good at itbr br finally the premise of the show and its the same every single episode so big time spoiler alert here timmy wishes for something with his two fairly oddparents something goes wrong theres always some contrived reason why he cant immediately reverse course and wish away the damage and then everything turns out just fine in the end oh and on a side note timmys parents never believe him when he complains about vicky and they continue to employ her at every opportunity maybe its just me but it seems that a kids show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isnt a great idea br br if youre writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen the fairly odd parents has to be a great place to start a prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it
