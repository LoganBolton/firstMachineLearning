what starts out as a gentle country yarn inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward nortons initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild westernbr br an amiable rancher norton wanders into town and charms a young girl evan rachel wood seemingly rescuing her from a deadend existence with her badtempered father with a whirlwind romance but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eyebr br edward norton Â– a real chameleon actor with changing facial hair to match playing a country hick accent slightly dodgy but maybe because hes merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan however with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at nortonbr br down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace and by never really making the protagonists motives clear the audiences sympathies for the characters remain uncertain should we like this drifter or not even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear this ambiguity is to the films detriment as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotchpotch had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess fans of oldfashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone completist fans of norton aside or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley give this a miss
