i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i dont want to spoil this film  dont worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen  but heres an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horsebr br to be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid
