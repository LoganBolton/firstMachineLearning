the longer this film went onand it seemed to tediously go on for ever the more annoyed i became as quite frankly what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense how on earth do people get to make films like thisor indeed receive finance for such rubbish dont be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal gun culture br br anyhowbr br the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawlhe comes across a family with two spoiled brat children a teenage girl and boy taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope the cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or viceversa and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loserbr br the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depressiona total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legallybr br ask yourselfbr br who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trashbr br this film is pointless drivelbr br it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able musicbr br 210
