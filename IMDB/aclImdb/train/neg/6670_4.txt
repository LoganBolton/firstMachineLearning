this film really got off to a great start it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between harlan and tobe in long poetic and idyllic scenes it really didnt need to be anything more than that and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake another timeless classic a modern myth perhaps why oh why then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character nortonanother psycho maybe im missing the point but do we really need another film about psychos or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry for a moment there i was going to make a mental note of the directors name now im left feeling indifferent at least it should be added in the films defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles also evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential
