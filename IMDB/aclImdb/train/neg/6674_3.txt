id have to admit that the draw of this movie is director eduardo sanchez who helmed the wildly popular and successful blair witch project besides this is an alien movie of sorts and sounded something like stephen kings dreamcatchers one of those movies that the critics hated but i enjoyedbr br but nope unfortunately i felt that for the most parts altered is a waste of time so i shall keep this review short premises are always promising and altereds no different it tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger and as usual others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices so i shall not go into details but you get the drift its damn uncomfortable and something youd like to forgetbr br what if youre given a chance for revenge that is you manage to successfully hunt down and capture one alive what will you do for this group its a gleeful payback time or so they thought and this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest with bad uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting even if its low budgeted there arent many redeeming factors be it strength of storyline or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting its the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script coupled with some cheap scare tactics employedbr br whats good though is the makeup much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which i shant mention because thatll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable other than that there are the usual cheap special effects blood and gory moments which is nothing youve never seen beforebr br watch this only as a last resort compared to the other monster movie in town  feast this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously bogged down by an uninspiring direction youve been warned
