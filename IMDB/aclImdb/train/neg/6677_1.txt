after reading the first 5 reviews on imdb i was very enthusiastic about this movie but its really an awful movie the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes the rest of the movie is cheap suspense the acting is over the top en the story oh boy which storybr br the story doesnt seem to go in a direction first they capture the alien after 7 years they finally succeed then they dont know what to do with it after 7 years and even want to release it why the hell did they capture it then the girlfriend whos acting is the most over the top wants to walk away from this madness then suddenly she doesnt then again she does and then she doesnt then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race and remember in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens and what do they do they torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peacesbr br this is my first review on imdb im a very lazy person who doesnt write very soon so listen to my warning this move is not worth your time dont watch this movie
