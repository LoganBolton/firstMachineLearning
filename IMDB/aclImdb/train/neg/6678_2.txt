this is a copy of the 1948 doris day classic romance on the high seasbr br the story line is more or less same but is contemporary govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip while rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour they ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in bombaybr br on the trip govinda mistakes another girl for sanjivs wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing ranibr br lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings they are pitted against each other for the warring couplebr br it is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling the comedy is slapstick and will not make one laugh too much
