when i first saw the trailer for prom night i have to admit the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people there was no tension the characters how was i supposed to care about them they had no development whatsoever the killer oh my god this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed i know its a film but why would a man who neveror at least we know of killed any one before kill a girls family and friends that hes just obsessed over i mean was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her i have no idea because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horrorbr br donnas family was just brutally murdered by her teacher who has become very obsessed over her he was captured and put in jail its been 3 years and shes just now getting some peace in her life shes even going to her senior prom but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends and the hotel maid and the bell boy because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employees are donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses unnoticed and can kill people so silently just wowbr br im sorry i really did want to love this movie we havent had a good slasher flick in a long time but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious i know that this was a pg13 movie but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes not to mention no stab holes i wouldnt recommend this movie for anyone unless youre a teen this movie was made for the teenagers not adults and not for those who know a real horror movie no offense to those who did enjoy this film but i dont understand how anyone couldbr br 210
