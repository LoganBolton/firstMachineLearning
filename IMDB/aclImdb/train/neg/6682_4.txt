this comedy is really not funny it a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact its a caper film so derivative  yes even back then  it has no snapbr br the cast is adequate more than that its hard to say however whats nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actressesbr br we can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values arent awful yet it makes no real impressionbr br its a generic knockoff and who wants that
