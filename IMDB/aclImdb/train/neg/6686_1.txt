there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film theres not one scary funny or even interesting scene in this film it advertises itself as a horror then goes on to call itself a comedy it doesnt even attempt humor neither does it attempt to be scarybr br in order to not be bored by this film you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all im having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this its not funny scary shocking or intriguing so was it supposed to be a drama because it really wasnt dramatic eitherbr br please just do yourself a favor and dont watch this film life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this
