the hazing is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb yes thats how shallow i am i dont care if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so i guess ill just have to see it  now the hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title curious the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller first of all theres something very wrong with the tagline on the old vhs box i watched it says he had good grades a good girl and good buddies  until they put him through the hazing thats not the case actually protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith still with hair in this film both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious delts fraternity but during their hazing exam  in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies  barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg when lewis returns with the other frat boys barney froze to death already together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend skitrip with barneys body hidden in the cafeteria freezer lewis has to cover for him so that barneys absence doesnt look suspicious the setup of the hazing is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there arent any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither the soundtrack is cheerful and full of lightheaded tunes but thats nearly not enough to make this film a comedy around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside i didnt like the final twist because its quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after though admittedly after the hazing is not a complete waste of time but still im glad i found an exrental tape at a friends house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd
