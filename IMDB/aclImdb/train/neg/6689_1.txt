i can only assume that the other reviewers of this film are stockholders in the production company as this was quite possibly the worst movie ive seen in the last five years from the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered blevel both my wife and i were in a great mood before starting this film and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie we knew we hadnt rented citizen kane and we werent expecting to see the most amazing movie ever however after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage ive ever seen we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our livesbr br if a comedy with no laughs terrible acting thin plot and annoying characters are your thing then this film is for you honestly troll 2 is betterat least i laughed at the popcorn sex scenebr br i cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because ive already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke
