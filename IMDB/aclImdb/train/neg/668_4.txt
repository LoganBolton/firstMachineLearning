so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie im a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thrillerbr br i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but id have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game  acting wisebr br yes ill give props for the plot because it was good but its not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jumpinyourseat scenes so dont waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait til it comes to dvd
