i sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations my expectations were no where near low enough i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it and if it was a comedy the humor was completely missed the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous my friends and i managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time i honestly dont know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it considering not only its very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actorsactresses in its cast this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made its certainly the worst movie ive ever had to sit through
