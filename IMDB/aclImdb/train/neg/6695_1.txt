ive had a thing for this kari chick for a while and as far as how she looked in this movie no complaints but after catching it last night in high definition i am certain thats the only thing in the movie that isnt substandard the script is horrible the acting is horrible the direction is horrible i saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes werewhat not at all when a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn but instead i get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing wuhrers body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease they should have just gone cinemax so that the movie wasnt a complete waste of time but no with a script this awful they shouldve capitalized on wuhrers looks since thats the lone pro of the movie 210 only because she looked so hot
