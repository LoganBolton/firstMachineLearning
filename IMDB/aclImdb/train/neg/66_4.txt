i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor so i gave it a chance from director gregor jordan buffalo soldiers basically ned kelly heath ledger is set up by the police especially superintendent francis hare geoffrey rush he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his familys names thats really all i can say about the story as i wasnt paying the fullest attention to be honest also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne naomi watts as julia cook laurence kinlan as dan kelly philip barantini as steve hart joel edgerton as aaron sherritt kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick kerry condon as kate kelly emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott ledger makes a pretty good performance for what its worth and the film does have its eyecatching moments particularly with a gun battle towards the end but i cant say i enjoyed it as i didnt look at it all okay
