i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things i probably could if i could get past rachellebr br im sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer it doesnt work for someone whos really interested in improving the planetbr br this show should be called nagging with rachellebr br since ed is such a great font of information maybe a second show thats really serious about the environment would be a good idea dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us br br i no longer record episodes or watch the show but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works
