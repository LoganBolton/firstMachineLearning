i noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults it probably earned some of them but it wasnt that bad well ill be honest i never want to see this film again it was a bad film but i dont hate this film it tried to tell a story as a drama this film could work very well actually i just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy with a rewrite it could have been a great film but as a satire it didnt work in its current form  many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story still it wasnt the worst independent film ever made  is it in the top 10 worst thats debatable
