i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together by the filmmakers own admission on the official site  the short was exhibited as a roughcutbr br but nonetheless it was an easygoing comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh  thats all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my 2 cents anyway
