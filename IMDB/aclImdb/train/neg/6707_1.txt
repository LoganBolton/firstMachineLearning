please make me forget please please this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences what a load of garbage and dont get me started about the acting someone please help me forget weird science  come back everything is forgivenbr br i am proud to give this film the first 1 here at imdb and ive voted for hundreds of films many of them cp but this is so bad i cant even believe it someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film someone read the script and auditioned for it someone saw the film and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity these are the questions i want answers to not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well you know
