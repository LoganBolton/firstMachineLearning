turn your backs away or youre gonna get in big trouble out of my boyfriends back only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment youre watching this its safe to say that the entire movie falls apart with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max we get a name like johnny every so often and this johnny has nowhere to go there isnt a specific reason to why our dead corpse crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night so that renders the movie totally useless without a feeling of sorrow his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that hes dead johnny takes a bite out of eddies arm afterwards the viewer is asked a tough question why does the movie have to be this cornball there is an answer any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental living is a coincidence dead has nothing in common with the movie show this one to your girlfriend and shell skip the senior prom turning your life into a deserted ruin blah
