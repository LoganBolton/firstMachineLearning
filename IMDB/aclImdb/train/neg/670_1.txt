prom night is about a girl named donna brittany snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies br br now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg13 horror movies that havent been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog oh my god and talking about girlish things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but im still not done with the reviewbr br the only reason to see prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills if not dont see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 247 so not only arent they scary but its obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of oh my gosh its our prom i understand its fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate br br if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films id be the first one too im not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously dont spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a night to die for when watching the filmbr br 1 star out of 10 ps if i could give the film zero stars i would
