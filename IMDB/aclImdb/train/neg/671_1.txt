poor acting no script no plot no convincing killer no suspense no original setups it uses the same closetunder the bedpersonbehindyouinthemirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring and not in a foreshadowing way either and the fact that nobody ever really gets killed at least not on screen  which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticketits a horror film wo any horror lmao the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheetbr br you have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this or you were highdrunk at the timebr br honestly i have a life and dont bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something or enjoyed it tremendouslybr br but this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again br br it is one thing to rent a bad movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins its another when you have to sit through it in a theaterbr br also in case you want some remake nostalgia forget it this is not a remake nor is it a reimagining it is not scary nor engaging nor is it satisfying enough to be funny like others on imdb have claimedit is just stale and booooringbr br here is what you will take away from this film remembering the scar on brittany snows head that stands out more than the plot the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with js cardone of the forsaken to have gotten another role as a killerbecause he is as frightening as my poodle and too cute to kill just about anyone and that for some reason duh everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesnt show up this is my warning to you do not waste youre money like i did the original sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans though no way near as bad as this piece of crap sorry to sound vulgar or rude but once you see this you will understand why i say what i say
