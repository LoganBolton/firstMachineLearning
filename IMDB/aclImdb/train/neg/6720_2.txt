now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land how did the dierector get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché but somehow cuteor is that cliché piled upon cliché no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sants gerry and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didnt get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the unrequited loves a bore theme left over from a faded streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they refilmed half of it got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and heyprestocomedy tonight a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform i can understand why
