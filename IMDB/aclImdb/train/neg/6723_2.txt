charlottes deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than itd be otherwisethe story is so poor and charlottes character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if thiss the ending they had thought of for this movie i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists but i fear it doesnt as for the rest of the cst well id say they simply didnt act very well although the blame should be put on the poor scriptthis movie reminds me of rush hour 2 where zhang ziyi dies in absurd way since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie i could give this movie 25
