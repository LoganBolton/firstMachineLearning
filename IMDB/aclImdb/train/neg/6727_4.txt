the soloist has all ingredients to impress the academy its director joe wright has already authored a best picture candidate the leading actor robert downey jr starred in a widely praised superhero film finally the movie itself is a drama when it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 filmgoers and critics were baffled now that ive seen it i assure you universal didnt just delay this film to promote iron manoscar buzz the soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidatesbr br downey and costar jamie fox arent to be blamed for this mishap joe wright is largely at fault but even he cant save a lifetime story many movies are too complex and alienate viewers this one is unusually simple its a movie about a newspaper reporter steve lopez downey who befriends a homeless musician nathaniel ayers jamie fox thats it ayers is schizophrenic and doesnt resonate with lopezs traditional approach to friendship the two become friends they begin this movie as acquaintances and are bffs by its end tension consists of moments like this will ayers let lopez take him to the homeless shelter this material would have been better suited as a madefortv production rather than a feature filmbr br wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content lopez battles yarddefiling raccoons in what i consider a subplot do you remember when this happened in atonement or pride and prejudice those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged ayers back story is fleshed out when it doesnt need to be worst of all these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals its a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing i was too this is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with ayers when most of us already have it hes a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud the movie somewhat conveys humanitys love for music like amadeus and beethoven lives upstairs it isnt as effective as either of those pictures however the entire film is hinged on ayers schizophrenia it ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else his being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including the film doesnt incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona take music out of amadeus or beethoven lives upstairs and no film remains the soloist is more about friendship in general than music nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously alteredbr br this is only joe wrights third film and his first that isnt a romance staring keira knightley lets hope this film isnt an indication of how limited his abilities are there are stylistic nods to his earlier works but the soloist is much weaker than either of them in his defense universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture this film seems tailored for imagine entertainment distributors of changeling i wouldnt be so disappointed with it if had a limited release its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally
