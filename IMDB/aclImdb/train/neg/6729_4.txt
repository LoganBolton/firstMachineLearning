evidently lots of people really like this but i found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers especially the opener but theres a marked dip in invention later on i dont get on with monroe  shes supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who aint that dumb but she just comes over as dumb russell cant quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium but is otherwise rather wonderful the men are staggeringly uninteresting as is the plot by no means atrocious but so patchy that if this is a classic god help us all
