prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker exboyfriend its dramatic  its sappy  its immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie historybr br our director is working with a fairly goodlooking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife youd probably go  oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator youll get 15 jump scares in this film 2 of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything id also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave mebr br as if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds im not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film im saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing youd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shotbr br with a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons were left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review dont let my sacrifice be in vain dont go into the movie
