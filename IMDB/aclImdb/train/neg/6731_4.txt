contrary to another reviewer i think that this is wellwritten especially the more fictional it is because greater imagination would be required and well acted because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozenminutesplus welldone monologues but im just not entertained by such solemn pious rememberances everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others everybody has problems and some are more intense than others these are just ten notveryatypical stories and problems exemplifying how anybodys life or part of it is fodder for film then again i think poorly of tvs reality shows too so if thats your bag you may like this its the kind of stuff that would make for good phone andor internet gossip but absolutely without otherthanverbal action and although each of the speakers is female im gonna leave gender outta this
