i discovered this movie on ifc and i thought it would be interesting for tiny love stories some of the stories really dragged on in this movie the fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives including kathy baker and alicia witt i have to admit i want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again like in strike1998 when odette sinclairs acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time and tweety asked was it beautifulbr br some might think reenactments and flashbacks would improve this movie i think it would make things even worse it doesnt necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention but somehow i just expected more
