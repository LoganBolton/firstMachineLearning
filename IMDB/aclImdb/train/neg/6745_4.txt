this is a lowbudget scream style movie maddy is a new worker at a conspicuouslyunnamed office where she meets and starts a relationship with her coworker chris during a hot tubparty chris and his friends convince maddy they belong to a murder club where everyone has killed someone for kicks when maddy loses it and kills someone for real hijinks ensuebr br the film looks good and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level nudity gore maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast but after the credits roll youll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it
