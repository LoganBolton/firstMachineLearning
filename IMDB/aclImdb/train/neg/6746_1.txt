spoilers includedbr br with a title like bleed you know the creative juices werent running on high when this puppy was conceived the movie is your basic runofthemill lowbudget slasher movie oh sure it tries to be creative with the premise of the murder club but we learn that was just a joke anyways okay for those who really care about these things the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her coworker he invites her into his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a murder club and they murder people blah blah blah well we learn that it was all a joke but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage now the members of the murder club are being killed one by one oh and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer by that time you wont really care thoughbr br in retrospect the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film but on the dvd there are deleted scenes im not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of bleed but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be clamoring for more on the box it says there are easter eggs but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me br br i was expecting a bad movie and bleed delivered on that front it wasnt a fun bad movie though everyone looks good in the movie and theres plenty of nudity but the acting is just awful my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killeri think hes supposed to be funny and amusing but he just ends up coming off as a tool i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilariously unconvincing death heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing and she spits out a mouthful of blood and dies br br for those who think that movie making is an intricate creative process done by professionals check out bleed it will change your mind and youll realize any hack get can a movie made br br otherwise dont waste your time or money on this
