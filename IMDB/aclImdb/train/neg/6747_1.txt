wowspeechless as to the making of this film i cant say much the coverbox at the local videostore shouldve said it allnothing but 6 actorsactresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a moviebr br the acting was apparently not in the budget but they were able to afford nudity and goodlooking actors style over substance almost makes its mark here except most of these actingclass failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script after only 4 or 5 kills by the socalled masked murderer and a confusing tiein plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as thisbr br i feel bad for the people who bought this film and cant find anyone to take it off their hands another example of whats wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials throw it away if you did buy this
