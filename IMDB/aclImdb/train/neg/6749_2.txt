this mess is so bad it doesnt even qualify as horror br br debbie rochons talent is completely wasted in this film she is not even the villain the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i wont even mention itbr br do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform better than sex its total 80s disco candy song nice up tempo song about gambleing  sex way more entertaining than bleed put it this way when one has the equipment to copy videos but decides only to record the song at the end of movie you have a really bad movie
