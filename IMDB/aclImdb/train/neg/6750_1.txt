when you put this dvd into your player and hit play you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc cherish this moment make sure you have some tylenol or something preferably pms so you can fall asleep because youre going to have a massive headache once this movie startsbr br starring a bunch of bigbreasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit i thought id be in for a good time sure the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff by the way my sole chuckle was from julie strains final comment in this scene but then i knew there was trouble the opening sequence had a terrible rock song during this terrible rock song i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said topless in the backyard and better than sex i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to bebr br and thats the sad truth the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast other than that its a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an innovative concept about murder clubs which ends up being fake anyway so the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you dont care for any of the characters i mean when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman can you really feel any sympathy towards her when shes in fear for her life the scream influence is prevalent throughout with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes were also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad lloyd kaufman the only other cool part of the movie about an abortion or something uh yeah this isnt a sobaditsgood movie its just badbr br someone compared this to a troma film but you know most any film that comes from full moon or its offshoot as this film proves is horrible not horrible in a troma sense  ive seen many troma films and i can honestly say they all offer something anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later however this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it beware
