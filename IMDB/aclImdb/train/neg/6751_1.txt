my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good halloween takeoff a killer terrorizing young people a white maskyou get my drift we were dead wrong no pun intended we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there but also that it is a cult classic it is filled wplot holes and makes no sense the actress who plays maddy is pretty but thats about it i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budgeti always support movies like that just not this particular onebr br this movie may be good to see if youre drunk or high otherwise dont bother unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did
