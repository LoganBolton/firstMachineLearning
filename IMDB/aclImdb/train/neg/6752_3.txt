sadly more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other good thing was the cast im not saying that the acting was good because it wasnt but every actoractress was hot and attractivebr br one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time its not that im against nudity but this was a horror movie not the dreamersbr br unless youre very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or youre a diehard fan of debbie rochon than this is the movie for you but if youre looking for a good horror movie stay away
