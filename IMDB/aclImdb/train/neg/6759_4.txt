another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shotonvideo quality of the film br br it wasnt that bad rochon does a serviceable job and damn the cast is good looking ive never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer but it was not to be my biggest problem with the film was that by the end i didnt much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking ha betcha didnt see that one coming sucker yeah there were continuity errors about mainly with ms rochons everchanging wardrobe but for an indie slasher its not that bad i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick the dialog was overly think and painful at timesbr br just dont have high expectations going into this and it wont be that bad and lloyd kaufmans cameo is wonderfully understated
