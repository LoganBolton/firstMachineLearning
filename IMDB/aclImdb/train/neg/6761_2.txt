lets be honest as a film school project made without budget and real actors this is a passably interesting film as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer its a very poorly produced product if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product ie a film i feel deeply disappointed its a videotaped tv play something along the line of old sixties serials but without that certain charm aside from the leading man mr redfield who also is the director the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus a bit too old for that actually or members of the directors household who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches but also the makeup artist or hairdresser a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s its all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small bare studio sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame period inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion the film attempts to be dreamlike whereas in fact its merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing and believe me the standards werent too high to start with there are interesting dialogs every now and then but overall its pretty lame and twodimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew thats how artsy films attempted to look in the 80s mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director
