i wanted to see it because of two reasons one it was the remake of high sierra with bogart two the bogart part was played by jack palance whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility as in the big knifebr br but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake the film follows the same plot as hig sierra only here the actors dont care the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what shes doing in this film i dont even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role and of course they had to use the dog story again they surely could have come up with some different ideas perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra but that definitely doesnt add any quality to the filmbr br its a waste of time if youve seen high sierra before otherwise why not see a pseudofilm noir as for me id rather die than see it one more time
