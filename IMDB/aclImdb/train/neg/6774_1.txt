as an avid fan of cary grant i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter as amc billed it as a comedy i have never been more disappointed with a film carys usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie he comes across as strained bored and just not himself mississips character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed  his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from and whenever he does deliver a line its several decibels higher than any other cast member mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable countrybumpkin goofball but in the end he manages only to detract from the already weak plot mansfield looks more like an obscene blowup doll than a hollywood sex kitten and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with ray walstons character was sugary and ultimately contrived for four men on shore leave it was the tamest leave ive ever seen i watched this nightmare until its very end and while i wont spoil that for anyone i will tell you that its the most absurd youll ever see the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast sorry cary
