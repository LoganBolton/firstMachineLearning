while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review i really didnt like this film even though it had so many similarities both were made just a few years apart both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies however the overall tone and style of the films were quite different kiss her for me overall just seemed like a cheaper filmwith poor writing little energy and some very broad performanceseven when compared to operation petticoat i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this abudget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio plus there wasnt much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grantan actor generally loved for his grace and class its sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main
