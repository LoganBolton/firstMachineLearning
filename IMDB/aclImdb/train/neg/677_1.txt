i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing preachy cinematic trash larded with enough indianwannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a newage shop starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a featherwearing crystalfondling idiotbr br the plot alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earths impending environmental collapse but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar fortunately theyve got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings as well he ought to be along with buckets of cheap fx and reams of pointlessly swelling musicbr br sure the clunky script helps to obscure the films trite plot and staggering pace but thats just the tip of this melting movie iceberg everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science
