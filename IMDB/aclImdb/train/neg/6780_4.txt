this film was a critical and boxoffice fiasco back in 1957 it was based on a novel which was later turned into a playwhich flopped on broadway the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii they have 4 days leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and dramabut here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesnt really pull it off tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant but had other commitmentsso suzy parker stepped in she had never acted before but was americas top photographic model at the time i think that she did a good job considering all the pressure that she was under grants pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenesdid not really work the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grantbut the character had no substance at all
