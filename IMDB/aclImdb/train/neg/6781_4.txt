a good cast with one major exception pushes its way through epsteins smart light satire mansfield was never better or funnier than she is here paired with walston whos a veteran whos determined to become a congressman to get out of the war he and his buddies  including suave conartist grant  head to san francisco on leave and start the citys swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours the only thing about this movie thats not delightful is suzy parkers onenote performance as grants love interest which takes up too much of the films time and slows down the pace in the second half walston and mansfield have good chemistry the gimmick is that shes set on making love to every serviceman to do her duty for the war effort of course but hes a married man who nonetheless loves his wife they steal the movie with little trouble from grant whos amusing here in the first part of the film when not paired with his nonactor costar
