there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 810 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since given the very low average rating given to the film by other people i think you may draw your own conclusionsbr br this is a very bad film ill admit it i thought the concept was kind of cute and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work but it didnt take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself knownbr br acting the leads seemed competent enough but everyone else terriblebr br plot chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck throughbr br direction nonexistentbr br humour did they really think people were going to laugh oh boybr br eye candy ok there were some really beautiful women in this film not just the three main female characters but right across the board it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldnt notice how terrible everything else was if so they failed miserablybr br in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic it wasnt even close
