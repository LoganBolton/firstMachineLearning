im sorry to report that i have seen this film several times when it bombed at the box office it was repeated nightly for about a month on hbo and i watched it over and over because television in general is so bador was at that time i no longer watch so it might be wonderful nowlike samuel l jackson says about swine it might taste like sweet potato pie but ill never know because i wouldnt eat the filthy mfer lets see dudley plays arthur wandering in the desert always a few steps behind moses it came out right after life of bryan so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from the few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth theres one scene where arthur and dom deluise meet in the desert both of them dragged out and dessicated dying of thirst then they meet like old acquaintances who didnt really know each other very well promise to do lunch it could have been funnybr br but the scene that i remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full king tut regalia he must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release they overdubbed his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe kid dynowannabe or it might have been jimmy walkerwho knows who cares they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist very unfunny very long piece of excrement one of those legendary things that just wont flush no matter how many times you try so you leave it there for someone else to deal withbr br well thats my review if you rent this movie dont buy it whatever you do prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of coronabr br now that theyve remade the poseiden adventure this one is probably high on the list for remakes maybe theyll hire a comedy writer this time
