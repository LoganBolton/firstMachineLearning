the plot of this movie hangs on one important point that this murderer was also a responsible loving caring father not that being a father and a murderer is impossible but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion this girl was someones daughter i dont think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so coldblooded to someone elses daughter or alternately could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victims parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond beliefbr br that said the characters were acted with conviction by the actors i thought changing scott bakulas eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is you couldnt see into his eyes at all
