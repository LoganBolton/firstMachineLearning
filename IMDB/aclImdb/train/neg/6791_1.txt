this is a movie about animal cruelty under the guise of a marathon race we see depictions of extreme animal abuse including literally running a horse to death in slow motion the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burialburning of the horse which of course is still dead having been tortured to death this is one of the sickest slimiest movies ive ever had the displeasure of viewing as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals were supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race id like to put the producers and director in a marathon race ill decide when theyre finished probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing
