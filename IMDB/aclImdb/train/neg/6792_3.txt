heres a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just dont have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the nonslow motion scenes this film needed to be spedup if anything that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but ive certainly seen all of them do better ben johnsons always a joy though i first saw this flick almost 30 years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later
