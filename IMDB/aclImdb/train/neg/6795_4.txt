the comeback starts off looking promising with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer the mask itself is pretty cool too and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990s slasher film granny from then on the film is mostly boring we get a few more deaths which again are good but theres not enough of them the reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody the story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part br br i would avoid this unless youre a diehard collector  theres not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick
