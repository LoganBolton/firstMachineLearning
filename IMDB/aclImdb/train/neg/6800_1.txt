i signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is besides being a ripoff of executive decision or air force one or any other kind of terrorist story this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well its hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid clich√©ridden script to work with its bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence but when you find yourself groaning over and over again you have to conclude that the director also isnt the brightest bulb in the movie business nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place the mostly lowrent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure not that being a part of this jokeofamovie is going to earn them any awards or recognition it may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser i see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case for to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand just as studying wellmade movies can inspire you how to make a good skillfully puttogether work of art and beauty the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what not to do and what does not work be warned
