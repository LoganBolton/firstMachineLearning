firstly i wont tell you why i rented this movie as im still confused myselfbr br air rage is much like any movie ive seen where a plane is hijacked there is of course that one important person on the plane and the hijacker looking for revenge the sad thing is some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies are we really becoming so unoriginal so quicklybr br although its icet who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at acting while hes not busy putting the c back in front of rap who is glorified on the cover the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim oja as a stewardess who is surprisingly overlooked by the five hijackers which naturally comes back to haunt them as for the rest of the cast the only person i managed to recognize was steve hytner more commonly known as kenny bania from seinfeldbr br i cant forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie when a hijacker used about a pound of plastique to blow a lock off a door brilliantbr br the plot was unnaturally predictablebr br the script  atrocious it got to the point where i could say something which i felt would make a stupid comment and it would be the next line in the moviebr br as for special effects the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity to run my tv and vcr for 100 minutesbr br and the title  the movie did take place in the air but due to the less than stellar performances the only rage in the movie was that of the viewerbr br so if youre in the mood to even pick apart a movie just because its bad please save yourself dont choose this
