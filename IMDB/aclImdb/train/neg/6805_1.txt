i ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes agowow i still cant believe what ive watchedbr br this is absolutely the worst movie ever if i would list all the flaws in the movie  this review would take me a lot of sentences very funny flaws because of being that bad thoughbr br you got to be amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane they didnt even know how to movebr br icet is so bad actor and the thing i dont understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero but hes a zerobr br of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747 needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the planeamazing as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at allbr br but i strongly recommend of watching this movie as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
