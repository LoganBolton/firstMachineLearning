besides all of the technical mistakes br br how about a female flight attendant whos able to kill all by herself 4 out of the 7 terrorists including ex marines 2 of whom without even using a gun then she lands the plane perfectly were not talking about sigourney weaver or linda hamilton were talking about a regular frightened yet very well composed flight attendant d how about the leader in charge of the assaultrescue squad having a fullproof according to the logic of the script plan of sleepgassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane only he decides at the spur of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists guns blazing not knowing where the terrorists are or how many and not securing a position of advantage so that his whole team gets easily wiped out yeah thats using the old noggin only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway and it turns out useless for all intensive purposesbr br bad as this movie was though i couldnt stop myself from watching and wondering what next d i cant help but imagine all the excellent unemployed script writers thinking to themselves its not fair lol d
