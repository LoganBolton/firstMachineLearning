what a complete piece of trash plot notwithstanding when a movies action revolves around airplanes youd think the writersproducersdirector or anyone would do a little bit of homework as to at least a few of the details the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie here are just a few im glad i missed the sr71 sequence  certain to have been worse than the air force one f117 spectacle commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than boeing 747  likely the cheap use of some boeing advertisingpublicity footage by the director exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring much less multimillion dollar aircraft avionics wiring airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ships supply oxygen to maintain breathable air and if they did rely on an onboard supply the canister would be far bigger than fist sized medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection those were f16s not f15s mach 1 speed of sound would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff watch the airspeed indicator standard formation is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile route formation is what they were flying  not the most useful formation for an intercept acquiring missile lock is not likely to get an airline pilots attention  they have no radar detection or countermeasures wait for my signal is not interflight communication for preparing to fire anything depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank yelling into a headset does not make it transmit magnetic headings are given as headings not bearings and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground so turning left not port  thats a boat thing from a bearing of 618 to 502 is just stupid it is in most cases impossible to just turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached  that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely airplanes dont stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multiengine thrust flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension not seconds before landing good way to crash wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane simply pulling the throttles this time a different lever in the movie to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f16s and not f15s guess i did and thats just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie
