one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and to be kind acting of less than oscar caliber but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft and especially a 747 some of the major blundersbr br 1 no flight engineer or even a flight engineer station 2 misidentifying the f16 interceptors as f15s no resmblance whatsoever 3 loading passengers into an aft baggage compartment supposedly accesible from the cabin  even if such a compartment existed placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable 4 hollow point bullets that wont damage the aircraft 5 the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke 6 an sr71 of all planes with a pressure seal hatch 7 opening a cabin door outward  into the wind  in flightbr br ah nuts it was just a truly lousy movie gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year
