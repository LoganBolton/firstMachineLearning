i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is   wow its hard to know where to begin  the incredibly hokey special effects check out the laser beams shooting out of willies eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a oneofakind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood
