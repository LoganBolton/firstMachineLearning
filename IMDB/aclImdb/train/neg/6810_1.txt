to be honest i didnt like executive decision  which was obvious the template  very much but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of artbr br not only that the people moving in the film the term actors would be an insult for all other actors should attend more acting classes the guy who build the setting hasnt even seen an aircraft from afar it is so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard but this is only the tip of the iceberg the film is full of illogicalness eg use sleepinggas then dont use it then use it anyway which dropped my rating finally to the bottombr br you can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk
