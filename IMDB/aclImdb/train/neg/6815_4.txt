the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest the intriguing plot such as it is seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along a wouldbe female vampire scantilyclad as promised by the title is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to feast on the blood of willing victims who are apparently members of a suicide club as if unsure where all of this would lead him the writerdirector ultimately has the human villain  actually the blankfaced heros kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant from the future the languorous pace and dreamlike atmosphere the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl are of course typical of both the filmmaker ditto the seashore setting at the anticlimax and the eurocult style as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display personally the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson who appeared in six latterday luis bunuel films crop up bemusedly through it from time to time
