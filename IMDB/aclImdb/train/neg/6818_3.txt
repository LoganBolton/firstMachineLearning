in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball joe pescibr br and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believablebr br pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasnt even wellplayed instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs then theres the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or somethingi dont even remembershe was that forgettablebr br anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who cant critique efficiently you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6br br stay awayfar away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better
