this review may contain some spoilersbr br just when you thought they didnt make them so extremely bad anymore along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor its even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of starlight a film that should only be viewed for laughsbr br chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining halfbreed part man and part alien apparently the earth is in dire straits something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland only by duplicating the dna of the halfbreed can the kindly alien race save the planet dont ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them anyway the halfbreed turns out to be billy wirth a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mothers line despite the fact that his mother is a redheaded caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson wasnt this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb the chosen one such a howler chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend before you can say utter the word hogwash chong is revealing her secret to wirth who isnt surprised for a moment and spreading the word to wirths family chong also makes pals with wirths mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years well this is because wirths father was an alien that abandoned her of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirths dna to make the people of earth his slaves huh his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the mostbr br the ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien but the effects are the bane of the movie the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light they use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles trouble is both chong and her superiors subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film now i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus and the cluster doesnt take up much room in the sky at all these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and    oh it has to be seen to be believedbr br starlight star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash todaybr br zantaras score 1 out of 10
