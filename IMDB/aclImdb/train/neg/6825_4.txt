once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former costars to clean up the townbr br low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesnt work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero hes not bad but hes really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said hes not bad hes just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isnt funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an unengaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its powerbr br i cant really recommend the film its worth a shot if youre a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment
