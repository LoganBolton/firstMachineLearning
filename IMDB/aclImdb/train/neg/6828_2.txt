in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no favours for chris klein he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happenedbr br one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented costars and does a semidecent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life whether fred can recreate this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but il be watching out for him in future
