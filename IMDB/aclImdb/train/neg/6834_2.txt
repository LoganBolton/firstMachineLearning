gee what a heck of a movie i said i wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades so i decided to start by this one it was a pretty adequate choice i entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces but i didnt see anything of the sort in this pastelcoloured mess i havent really watched many bad films before but ive got the feeling this is whats called so bad thats good probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny first of all there are the inaccuracies there are plotrelated inaccuracies physical inaccuracies and also psychological inaccuracies the latter in particular are as insane as van dammes ass cheeks inside that blue spandex extremely tacky lines exist too and i wont even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves there isnt exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie except in one particular case geoffrey lewis looks completely pathetic as frank which is an utterly stupid character and to tell the truth i was actually very surprised to see that van damme did a decent job playing the twins he succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me but the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio which is now bankrupt
