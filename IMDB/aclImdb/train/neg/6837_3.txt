normally i dont like revenge filmsperiod but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise you see di has action accuracy exotic localesie hong kong awesome gun battles and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat like all revenge flicks it has villains youd love to throw out of a plateglass window on the top floor of a 40story building however double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist racist and venomous social stereotypes that invaded eye for an eye and death wish 2br br but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap chad and alexs parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least thats what i remembered the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one it wasnt the watery plot that made this movie bad but the use of clich√©d lines and moves from other movies from lethal weapon to the princess bride really made it worse but nonetheless double impact is still watchable but why is that shitty movies like this have villainsfor examplethat greedy british guy that killed chad and alexs parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick you would love to hate with fiber of your being
