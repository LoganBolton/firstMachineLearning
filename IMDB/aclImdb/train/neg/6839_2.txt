twin brothers separated at birth due to the deaths of their parents reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel double impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the corsican brothers plot and jeanclaude van damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother also the action sequences arent as exciting this time and jeanclaude relies more on gunfire then on his martial arts also the supporting cast is wasted and at two hours the movie is just plain dullbr br  out of 4bad
