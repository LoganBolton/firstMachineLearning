i have copy of this on vhs i think they the television networks should play this every year for the next twenty years so that we dont forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again like putting some people in the directors chair where they dont belong this movie rappin is like a vaudevillian musical for those who cant sing or act this movie is as much fun as trying to teach the blind to drive a city busbr br john hood peebles has just got out of prison and hes headed back to the old neighborhood in serving time for an alltonice crime of necessity of course john heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the waybr br i would recommend this if i was sentimental or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma either way this is a poorly directed scripted acted and even produced i never thought id sat that satire of ghetto life with the hood although i think the redeeming part of the story through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up br br forget sonny spoon mario could have won an oscar for that in comparison to this rap oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and threequarters embarrassed be sure to drink first br br and please watch responsibly no stars better luck next time
