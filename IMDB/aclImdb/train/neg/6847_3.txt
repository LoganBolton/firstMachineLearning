this was one film i wanted to watch always when it released the promos were eye catching and govinda in a negative role was a surprisebr br but the film isnt that goodbr br it has lot of flawsbr br the start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between govinda and karisma and the songs that followbr br then the twist about govinda and tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then how come govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor villagerbr br the last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between govindakarisma and tabubr br n chandra disappoints music is okay bahot khoobsurat stands outbr br govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries tabu is okay nirmal pandey still doesnt know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
