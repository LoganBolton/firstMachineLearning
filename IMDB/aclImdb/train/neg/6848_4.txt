i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this horror movie i did not get scared even once while watching it it also is not very suspenseful either i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie so whats leftbr br the ring is a trully scary movie i wish other movies would stop copying from it eg the trademark long hair please give me some originalitybr br will not recommend this movie
