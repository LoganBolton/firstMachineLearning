this film is really unbelievable ive seen so much cheap trashmovies especially a lot full moonpictures but dollman is really hard so much comes together the laughable story the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects how long i could talk about them it is a really bad movie but also one of the funniest ones if youre a fan of bad movies to laugh about you have to see it and dont miss dollman vs demonic toys it really funnier and worse
