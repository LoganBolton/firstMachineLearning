this screwy comedy seems very forced indeed the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script and as a result it doesnt really go anywhere the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isnt all that funny and then when cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesnt want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and its really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy its really a shame too as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess considering that cooper made so many good comedies i recommend you see them instead
