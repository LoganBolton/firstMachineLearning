john hustons wise blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of flannery oconnors book than i could have imagined from the utterly terrible acting performances and dont you oh that was done on purpose you just dont get it me to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of rockford files this film was revolting i viewed it with no illwill at the outset and in fact expected a pleasant experience but the misrepresentation of the southern characters from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting comedic way their faith was portrayed was inexcusable right down to its end which was completely devoid of any character sentiment it failed in every place that oconnors book shined and resonated the actors portraying the southern policemen may as well have been eating smothered hotdogs from nyc street stands and quoting godfather the one redeeming acting performance was ned beattys lively and deadon representation of hoover shoates a religious conartist who hears moates preaching the church of christ without christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities oconnors powerful book is most wellknown for its creepy religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of faith mr hustons film is a shameful mockery of the authors intentions as they are understood by me and most of her fans if i may be so bold as to say so while i acknowledge that i cant know exactly what the author wished to convey i have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan if i viewed wise blood the way mr huston apparently did i would have thrown it in the trash for flannerys sake and mine i forgive you john huston the forgettingthat will take some time
