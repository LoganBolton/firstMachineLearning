i realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic that is the only positive thing i can say about this truly horrid adaptationbr br have you read wise blood its an amazing book flannery oconnor wrote about the south as no one else has she was a southerner herself a devout catholic and a remarkably gifted writer in her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness the characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but i can assure you that such people do exist not only do they exist they are human beings with families feelings and concerns like anyone else flannerys intentions were so often misunderstood  she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots  she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called graceeven in the most violent distressing and maddening of circumstances to read wise blood is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom finally it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions  our entire world viewbr br none of this comes through in john hustons gilligans islandlike adaptation none it is a farce a bad farce the entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach the acting is poor the southern accents are fake and insulting the filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners ms oconnors intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap amateur theatre the soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and clockwork orangestyle cheeseball electronics that doesnt fit the story or even the movie i was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out truly truly terriblebr br as an aside i do not agree with ms oconnors religious views and while i was raised in the deep south years ago i made my way north and have not looked back but the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals like every other place on earth and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive if youre into being offended which i am not then this movie most definitely crosses the linebr br i dont like to talk crap about an artists work  john huston was a man that i did not know and im sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker to which his respected place in film history attests my views are clearly skewed by having read and loved flannery oconnors work so i dont claim to be coming from any other perspective maybe as a standalone film it works for cinephiles but for flannery oconnor fans  and i might add for selfrespecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes  this movie is a waste of time
