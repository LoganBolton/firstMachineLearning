beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out therebr br the characters basically make no sense most of the timebr br the film has no real beginning middle or ending nor is anything ever explained muchbr br the film opens with a young man with the unlikely name of hazel motes apparently returning from a stint in the armybr br he hitches a ride to a two story house that is in extreme disrepair windows boarded over he goes in the house walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there this scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing further about the house or its historybr br it is never explained exactly whose house this is or where the people have gone but we are given the impression hazel has probably lived there at one timebr br hazel decides to go to a city why  we dont know once he arrives in this city he writes down a name  address that he sees on a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman who is a surprisingly fat hooker he sees her for awhile and then he apparently isnt seeing her anymore like everything else in this movie it comes to nothing and serves no purposebr br a young man named enoch tries to befriend him but hazel really isnt interested although they keep crossing pathsbr br enoch is about as crazy as you can get one of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultinglybr br we never really know why enoch behaves as he does or why hazel behaves as he does beyond the fact hazel had an overdose of old time scary fundamentalist religion via his grandfatherbr br enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in itbr br hazel who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching i got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into himbr br he has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter although their interactions never really make any particular point and there is no plot linebr br eventually hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins selfharmingbr br it is a very odd film interesting in its oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for itbr br the cast does an outstanding jobbut this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storylinebr br the film also has the characters tossing around the n word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialogbr br 2 stars
