this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldnt feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watchingbr br i dont enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torturebr br dean morgan rochester ny
