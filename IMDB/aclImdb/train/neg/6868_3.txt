ok admittedly as an orthodox woman who lives in boro park im going to be a little biased against this film however it seemed that boaz yakins sole purpose in making this film was orthodoxbashing with our wigs modest attire and separate seating were a pretty easy target already yakin never made it past the surface the result is a film with more holes than swiss cheese 1 yosi tells sonia off for loving him more than gd or their parents then he deliberately defies his fathers order that he not go swimming because of his poor health 2 sonia flips out at her sons bris why would a hasidic woman from monsey have such a strong reaction its hard to believe that she never attended one before lets face it even reform jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays 3 was mendel sleeping during his chosson classes hes supposed to satisfy his wifes passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street especially in the middle of the busiest street in boro park 4 sonia and mendel had to have been married for over a year and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other a little cluearranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesnt work out 5 if sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly she did not have to go through her lecherous brotherinlaw there are orthodox female doctors lawyers teachers etc sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic instead of taking control of her life she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she didnt like the outcome thats not standing up to ones environment thats pandering to stereotype frankly i think she got what she deserved
