in what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story turn about william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and faulkner obliged by creating a female role crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her costars young and tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraphlike shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch wuthering heights performed in semaphore seriously the almost entirely pronounless sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry jamesbr br the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his sanctuary and elsewhere when young proposes to crawford in tones presence in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their thelma  louise fate frankly its creepybr br not as creepy to this new yorker however as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach wellington which crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her handsi had to turn away and young turns into a gladiator blechbr br that being said there are some nice performances young is particularly engaging in a scene where hes taken up in coopers fighter plane and roscoe karns is delightful as coopers flying buddy tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy youngs fate crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a balancing act for one rolebr br the battle scenesnot surprisingly for a howard hawks filmare the most exciting part of the entire picture but not enough as far as im concerned this is 75 minutes of my life im never going to get back
