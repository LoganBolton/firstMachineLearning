a great concept gone wrong poor acting even worse writingafter watching the first two episodes i was wondering why it ever made it to season two the characters are forgettable the writing is poor the sets are just ok the special effects are simply sad  so much better has been made in the same timeframe  where is the money going on this one the first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast  the precept of the whole show is just silly now dont get me wrong i am a huge scifi fan and geek  but this show simply doesnt cut it as i said in the beginning i am truly surprised it made it to season two  so much better has been canceled after only one season jake 20 for example this show was just bad
