this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated rerunsbr br most of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads br br i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a 2001 showbr br the gnome was a nice character
