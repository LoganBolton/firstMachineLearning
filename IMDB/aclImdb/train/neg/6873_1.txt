the tv productions at the 2000s start were between weak and bad before marks like alias lost prison break desperate housewives or monk the tv didnt have the right hit yet which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s viewer titles like relic hunter mutant x the lost world sheena or even baywatch hawaii werent encouraging for you to watch and follow or at least werent that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them special unit 2 was no exception in fact its men in black meets the x files spoof  as if these were the special unit 1 but even according to this brilliant formula it didnt work well it was promising at the time there was some saturation out of the supernatural cases after a decade of many x files already so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too imagine mulder as womanizer  however special unit 2 wasnt the strongest in this or a strong when it comes to make a comic scifi show it was highly ridiculous where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one it enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly michael landes was noncharismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian his chemistry with alexondra lee as well as any supposed sexual attention was all languid sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work its clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea among evan katzs other works as a cowriter and a coproducer like seven days before or 24 later this must be a low point  despite the distinctive personality it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time therefore if that was there goal so they made one of the silliest indeed  and truly it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only
