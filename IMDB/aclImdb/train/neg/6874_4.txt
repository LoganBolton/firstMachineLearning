jeanmarc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i dont think this movies part of the dogma 95 manifesto though it really looks like it im not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jeanmarc barr the story is somehow interesting but i dont know theres something about the movie that i dont like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i dont know exactly where it stands sure its not a bad movie but i wont suggest people to see it neither ill tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and youre openminded give it a try you might like it
