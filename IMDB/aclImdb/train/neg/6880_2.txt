i was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be puerto rican when i heard it was rosie perez i wonderedcould she possibly know what it is really like to be puerto rican as far as i knewshe was a nuyorican well anyway i anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch i realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right rosie perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be puerto rican this documentary is more a 1st hand very very personal account on what it is like to be a nuyoricanand all of what that entails she like most of the nuyoricans i know have a watered down partial and sometimes twisted sense of history how could they notthey live here yes all of them are proud as they should be but a lot dont know the ins and outs of the real culture history and political background or language for the most part it all became very very apparent with her participation in the vieques issue regardless of my personal take is on this issueat least i know what the hell the fight is for there is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about and only participated in because it was a puerto rican cause i really dont understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it for those of you that are not puerto rican please view this as a partial account of a womans journey of self discovery and acceptance do not take this as gospela lot of it isnt even true please consider the source rosie is an actress not a historian this movie is not and should never be for other nuyoricans the base for their information instead just a step towards finding more info learning and debating what the reality is not just the one coming from this womans eyes
