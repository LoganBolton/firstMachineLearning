ive always liked fred macmurray andalthough her career was tragically cut shorti think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy lamour and charles butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you geta mediocre movie experiencebr br skid johnson fred and maggie carole meet cute during her visit to the panama canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love skids a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he neglects maggie who later inspires him to start over after hes hit rock bottom ah yesits the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soonbr br stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slowpaced that its difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and slow direction just dont give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesnt ring truebr br this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours
