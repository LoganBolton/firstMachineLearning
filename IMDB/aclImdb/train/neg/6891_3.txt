starts really well nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes the charm is lostbr br the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial successbr br lets be honest  heders acting was pretty poor keaton daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its lengthbr br the ending is about as predictable as they come  so predictable ive ticked the spoilers box for this one linebr br my advice avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to dolisten to or watch and even then youll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life
