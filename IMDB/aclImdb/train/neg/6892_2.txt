oh my goodness this was a real big mess that just couldnt help itself jeffrey jon heder is a 29 year old man still living with his mum diane keaton and not planning on going anywhere until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert jeff daniels who she may be getting married tobr br it would have been an ok movie if heder didnt play his jeffrey so annoying from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse in the end we are supposed to like him but there was no reason to as he hadnt changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the moviebr br keaton doesnt look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007s because i said so not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton and where supposed to believe that their mother and son the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they dont look very interested either apart from a few little smiles this film really doesnt deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort
