what the  is this  this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you cant set your expectations for an 80s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for 089 and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks br br who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldnt possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didnt care they didnt try to create a tiny bit of tension the director  stephen carpenter  i guess its much easier to find money with a name like that  also made the kindred 1986 wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga   who   yeah thats right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits shes the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares  the rest of the actorsthey dont deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting youre hoping they die a quick and painful deathand not only their charactersbr br my humble opinion  0  10
