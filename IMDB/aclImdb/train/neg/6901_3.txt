the most positive thing i can say for this dull witted local comedy production is that its inoffensive in fact its so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of rewrites by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality its not witty its not entertaining its not insightful and its not charming its just a staid laughless progression of four losers who must change their ways  and their attitudes towards women  to be allowed to attend their best friends weddingbr br with acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society a plot line so tired itd make a forty third season of allo allo look fresh and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables siones wedding nonetheless scored ten yes 10 nominations in the nz film awards recentlybr br fortunately somebody saw sense and it didnt win any
