despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichésonly plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tensionbr br whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly smalltown kiwibr br has anyone not seen the brothers   httpimdbcomtitlett0250274  those who have will pick the similarities straightawayive heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forcedbr br i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self consciousbr br those who have any doubts left at all that samoanslivinginnz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this moviebr br robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the scriptbr br it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline  see the wanna be white boybr br i know someone who found this movie hilarious however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollarsbr br that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funnywake up nz  this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt    reviewsbr br my advice  if you watch it get drunk first
