the clich√©d polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters the supposedly samoan girl didnt look or act samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim with weak as water story lines you cant say anything about the acting  even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script its sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three jokes what a waste of kiwi taxpayers money what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community its better not to make movies if theyre as bad and mindless as this
