if youve ever seen an eighties slasher there isnt much reason to see this one originality often isnt one of slasher cinemas strongpoints and its something that this film is seriously lacking in there really isnt much that can said about pranks so ill make this quick the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list and that was my only reason for seeing it the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time as theyre in a slasher someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because despite a few gory scenes this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone and gorier slashers than this friday the 13th for example didnt end up banned but then again theres banned films that are much less gory than this one the witch who came from the sea for example anyway the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it as although the audience really couldnt care less who the assailant is by this point it is rather well done on the whole this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss
