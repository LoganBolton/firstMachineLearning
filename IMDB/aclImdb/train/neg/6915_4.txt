this is one of those films that i remember being in the can for years before anything happening wit i dont think its terrible but its not really good either alec baldwin was pretty good but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best the cast is pretty good in what theyre given but again you are only as good as the script baldwin directing this although i could have sworn he didnt direct all of it i thought i read somewhere or lots of reshoots wasnt bad but he definitely has some potential in there although his work on 30 rock is nothing short of genius  should keep him busy for a little while longer i just hope the show bows out gracefully a la seinfeld but maybe not even that long 9 years it went so if you want to see a film that you wont get much from but wont really hate either well this is for you i cant remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released  only on dvd at that it was nice to see alec baldwin  anthony hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen the edge now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment
