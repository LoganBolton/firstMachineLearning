this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but its surely a damn bad moviebr br the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates its poor production values and stupid plot i mean the subgenre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to addbr br the clich√®s are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mysterybr br this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldnt be hyped even if it has a video nastie labelbr br i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash
