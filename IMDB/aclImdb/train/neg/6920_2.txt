body slam 1987 is a flat out terrible movie the low budget reeks the direction is pedestrian at best and the writing and acting is lame but if youre into old school wrestling circa 1970s through the mid80 then youll be more entertained than the average viewer i have to warn you this movie stinks on ice i gave it a two because i felt like being generous this turkey was directed by stunt master hal needham the stars are roddy piper the tonga kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and clist actors dirk benedictbr br the synopsis of this movie is about a promoter who wants to combine hair rock and wrestling but their are others that dont want him to succeed theres more but i dont want to spoil it for you if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline theres a few surprises near the end for diehard wrestling fans br br i wouldnt recommend this to my worse enemy and i mean it
