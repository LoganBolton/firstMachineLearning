i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead you gotta love those bargain packs for even if they dont feature true remastering restoration and all that hooha and the films are generally in fullframe pan and scan format theres no denying that there are always a few gems included and by gems i mean theres always some good crap to be seen especially if the films are from the 70s as the mansion of madness isbr br my copy is called mansion of madness but when the title screens roll its poes dr tarrs torture dungeon doesnt matter really as crap is crap is crap no yes but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all there are some funky elements here and there and obviously the flick did have a decent budgetbr br the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look the dialogue is always hilarious near the beginning of the film the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road what strength says our hero funny then that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun youll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end thats how memorable these characters arebr br the best part about mansion of madness however has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure its like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable and why all the weirdo slapstick anyway id say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop what the hell oh yeah theres plenty of boobies to be seen too for those of you that dig such things boobies bad dialogue and wacky music that best sums of mansion of madness for me its well worth at least one viewing and may be a lot better if youve had a few to drink or whatnot i cant say i was ever bored watching it but i cant deny that its also a barrel of poop kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot but not hmmbr br and mr chicken pwnz
