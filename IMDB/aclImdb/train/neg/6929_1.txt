i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot im an open minded guy after all and i’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say here goes this film was mercifully short thats all i gotbr br okay okay the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowdbr br by the time of the chicken dance at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall i dont know what could have salvaged this film the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasnt any way to make it watchable not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film either way im not watching this film again unless im really depressed then i can tell myself “at least i wasn’t in ‘dr tarrs torture dungeon’ i’m better than those guys
