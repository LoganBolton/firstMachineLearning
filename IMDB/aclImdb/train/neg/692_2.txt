one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga the sure thing the fly 2 her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettablebr br during their christmas break a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture a crazy killer however throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome waysbr br exploiting every stalk n slash cliché in the book director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile the majority of the deaths which lets face it is why we generally watch this kind of film are brief and not that gory the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor there is one notably bloody dismembered corpsethe film couldve done with morebr br at the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher completists only
