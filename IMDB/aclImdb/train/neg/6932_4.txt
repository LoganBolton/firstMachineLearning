ive waited a long time to see dr tarrs torture dungeon and after i watched it i was really disappointed by it its not the baroque film i expected it to be the trailer which i saw on a something weird dvd is much better than the entire film which is remarkably forgettable there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesnt even come close to other baroque styled movies out there from fellini or jodorowsky the characters are dull and theres almost nothing dramatic going on even though we see rape crucifixion insanity etcbr br the main problem with dr tarrs torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talkathon more than anything else it was almost like watching a book i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something instead we seelisten to the main characters chitchat endlessly about dull stuffbr br a missed opportunity
