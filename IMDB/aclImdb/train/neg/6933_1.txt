relative to other columbo movies this can only be rated a 1 awful i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling traincrash of a film it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it  to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make nextbr br another reviewer suggested that it was falks only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role in fact i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money its a wonder they didnt murder him
