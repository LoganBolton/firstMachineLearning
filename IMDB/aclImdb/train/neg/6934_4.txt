ok so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955br br i pity the fools who still think so its absolute rubbishbr br the story is just  ridiculous the characters are absurd caricatures  but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isnt itbr br dean and others are too old for their parts people say dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly couldve his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so but dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy its patheticbr br natalie wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing it sets a bad precedent for the film and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes alongbr br it mayve been good for its time but really its drivelbr br it mustve just been hype about deans death that has overinflated the reputation of this film
