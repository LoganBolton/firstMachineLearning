the subject this latest admanturnedmovieman tries to tackle in his debut adventure is quite an ageold topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard  timeless romance pun intendedbr br however the exploration and exploitation for desi auds falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to pepper spice and sugar up the usual masala mix of bg score dialog dance drama etc creates a nicelooking package with not much insidebr br in the first 40 minutes of the movie the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 89 times further repeats follow thruout the movie after all the lead characters a cook but therein lies les problemos  no story hah no wonder someone forgot to write a scriptbr br amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada more amount of overacting really when is this guy ever gonna stop how many 60somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30something timeless mind yes but surely what about the notsoageless bod and sole sorry soul reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his newfangled discovery of a hot new idea nowhere are we presented with any reallife problems or issues such a pair might face other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle the subplot of a little kid with cancer the bachelor boys first love goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girls characterbr br anyway nice try but not quite there yet
