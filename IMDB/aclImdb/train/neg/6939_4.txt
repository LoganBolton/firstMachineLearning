r balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram gopal verma in nishabd in a sensuous way this time it is mixed with mature humorsbr br amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian cuisine in london he is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job according to him cooking is an art still cannot make hyderabadi biryani properlybr br enter tabu who sends her the proper hyderabadi biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other amitabh is 65 and tabu is 35 no probs but one hitch tabus father paresh rawal the couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage but amitabh realizes that tabus father is much younger to him and the complications begin performance wise all three actors are brilliant the script of the film is very tight and interesting the dialogues of the film are catchy but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled the comedy is sometimes not properly understood the film also tries to go lengthy at some partsbr br musically nothing much to sing about except the title track the camerawork is good director r balki could have given much better from this script but in the second half he himself looks confused the satyagrah scene of the father looked irritating but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are clap worthybr br on the whole cheeni kum needed to have more sugar
