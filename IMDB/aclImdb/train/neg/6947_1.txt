without a doubt one of the worst movies ive seen in recent years the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with its tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions oh no the cops are on to us they know who we are what do we dolets rob one more bank then were outta here what every character is a stereotype and its easy to tell whos gonna end up dead
