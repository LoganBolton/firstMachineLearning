its the early 80s theres a group of suspiciously oldlooking teens and theres a maniac stalking around yes this is slashervillebr br this movie is called pranks why is it called pranks i havent the faintest idea unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someones dinner with a baseball bat  on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told but there you gobr br the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose to combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark it ends in tears for most of thembr br pranks is a badly made slasher movie the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence this makes the dvd even more pointless because lets face it a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time for slasherfilm and video nasty completists only
