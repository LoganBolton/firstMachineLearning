we all knew even before it aired the ron moore miniseries is no battlestar galactica thats fine it just means it must stand on its own it cant lean on battlestar galactica if its any good its good on its own merits and ron moore has something to be proud of if reports are true this is what moore wanted however if his miniseries rots he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed onscreen not to mention the myriad offscreen personnel and this is what hes donebr br yes this miniseries is no remake i wouldnt even call it a reimagining its a new production inspired by battlestar galactica it does not take place in the galactica universe with the same places and jargon and technology it doesnt tell of the galacticas search for the thirteenth tribe nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica ron moores miniseries is a spaceopera action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galacticabr br maybe i should say just another spaceopera action flick because as plots go his has little thats original or even interesting i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning but i wont inflict that on you ill just hit the most important point ready now here it is just watch the trailer it will tell you everything there is in the storybr br yes creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man i guess they forgot azimovs rules again they look like humans so theres the whole aliensamongus thing at least theres no timetravel oh and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica that ceremonial nod it came off more corny than respectful i mean couldnt he even think up anything of his ownbr br from the first few minutes i wanted to watch something else i didnt care about any of moores characters since i couldnt identify with any of them this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack armageddon on a planetary scale and i didnt give a damn how depressingbr br moores heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle instead of overcoming it rather tucked tail and saved their own butts after all it was the only way to save humanity yadda yadda yadda they took the safe way out rather than risking their own lives to defend others at least disgust is not apathybr br but in the end the ron moore miniseries was just activity without purpose a movie on a treadmill forever running yet going nowhere and i just wanted it to be over and by the time it was over my lifeforce had been sucked from me against my own will i was turning into a mindless soulless zombie probably of the type to which this miniseries would appeal i needed to replenish myself i needed toand i swear this is truei needed to watch an episode of babylon 5 two episodes in fact and i felt much better and happier
