rating 4 out of 10br br as this miniseries approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned morebr br as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they facedbr br frankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didnt survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next showbr br the show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care aboutbr br the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the characters names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from sttng stds9 babylon 5 and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunatebr br ronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d  e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberrys sttng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldnt have happened period especially in time of warbr br the thing that i remembered most of ron moores earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica
