i fail to see the appeal of this series which is supposed to be scifi its really just lets see what soap operatically happens this week and oh the cylons are involved through flashbacksbr br the cylon babe that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame its pretty obvious that ta was added to the show every time she pops up im bewildered as to wtf is supposed to be going on and dont even try to bullsht me about story arcsbr br its a soap opera with some cgi thrownin this is not science fiction aside from the original premisebr br this series is not everything its workedup to be if you like trendy edgy dodgy jumpy vague editoroncrack camera work this show might be for you since nerds seem to be raving about this show its a clear indication that vocal nerds opinions have been changed from picards tng
