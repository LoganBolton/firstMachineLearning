sorry but every time i see a film wherein a woman suckerpunches a man and the man does nothing but cower the film looses all credibility so the new female starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground no pun intended dirk benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive herotype than the newage kattee sackhoff whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as a compelling exciting mustsee groundbreaking performance by the politically correct newspeak of todays review copy editors but in essence it is just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse the biggest clich√© on screens today i may give this series one more shot but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in as james hilton once bemoaned a story please just give me a story
