avoid this one unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie example the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear  a cardinal sin in a french filmbr br this film attempts to combine western drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic what well consider this the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights or how about the woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bedbr br someone should do a whats up tiger lily on this bomb rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it heck its almost that now btw gerard depardieu and carole bouquet both known to american audiences have roles
