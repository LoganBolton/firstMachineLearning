i went to see this a few days ago and its hard to forget that filmfor the wrong reasons this film is supposed to be funny its not not a single laugh in the theatre perhaps for josé garcia and gérard depardieu  and its boring boring boring it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying they just talk to fast and dont open their enough for us to understand i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny  what what did he say and im french i hate to say that given the fact that i think good films are made here but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film  if ever shown outside of france br br were deeply sorry for that crp 210
