i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a whats up tiger lily with this filmbr br it has to be one of the worst french films ive seen in a long time actually along with brotherwood of the wolves 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of timebr br its really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor filmbr br lou doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they dont necessarily give you talentbr br avoid this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de dartagnan
