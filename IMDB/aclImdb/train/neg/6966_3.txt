this movie is a mess but at least its not pretentious the box art for the video markets it as a fun throwback to 1950s giant bug movies in reality its a transparent bargain basement ripoff of aliensbr br the producers clearly wanted to make an alien picture but they mustnt have had much money in fact it doesnt look like they had any money really i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thingbr br the basic plot is retainedgroup of people isolated with murderous insectoid creatureand an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons i presume instead of setting the film in space where no one can hear you scream they set the film in a hospital where everyone can see your budget laid bare the amusing thing about blue monkey and there is only one thing amusing about it is the filmmakers didnt abandon the alien aesthetics even though were in a hospital we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted in this case the venerable growth hormone plot device the annex also doubles as a boiler room or something so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multileveled steel catwalks perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slatsbr br the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location he touches it and says ow so we know hes been hurt the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth i guess in an alien picture this would be called the mouthburster the worm is isolated but some naughty little kids leukemia patients sneak up on it and accidentally give it some experimental growth hormone you know everyones in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons right before hes grabbed by a pair of semiconvincing insectoid arms the rest of the movie is dominated by the semioffscreen monster semiobscured by the semidarknessbr br which brings us back to alien how you ask can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the alien movies no problema power outage or something causes the electrical system to go awry which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie this doubles as a convenient cloak for the lessthanspecial effects although the bugs are pretty neat looking they dont move too well and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toybr br ok so what alien bases havent we coveredoh water dripping down the walls checkwell divide the massive hospital into two parts then send some of the characters through the damp drippy basement to get to the other side problem solved we now have the opportunity for numerous foreboding tunnel shots and dont forget the fogwell you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies do you ok maybe inside of a hospital you do so well create smoke by having lots of things spark  burnbr br i havent said anything about the negligible acting not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow i take it blue monkey was supposed to be lighthearted and fun and if so then it is a nice try but the pieces dont come together and the movie ends up being a real drag see a film called return of the aliens the deadly spawn if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right with even less money and even more marginal acting talent this one falls flat on its alien
