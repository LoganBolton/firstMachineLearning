eh not a particular good slasher flick soso acting effects decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrackbr br there are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes apart from that theres a lot of characters wandering around not realizing whats going on or chasing after red herrings more killing of time than of people there are other deaths and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer not partial to any one implement the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well the identity isnt revealed towards the end and motive is pretty thin and we really dont carebr br supposedly the movie takes place around christmas but this isnt a major factor one scene gets lit by christmas lights thats about itbr br the movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time at least on the videotape i watched some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes the ending should have been stronger than it was we think we realize what happened although theres a chance something else did
