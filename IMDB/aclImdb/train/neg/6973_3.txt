never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet the title on the box said insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80s horror movie they can surely be fun of course as long as dont expect an intelligent scenario and as long as youre not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy makeup effects just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in blue monkey the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and theres a total lack of suspense following the alwayspopular trend of bigbug movies blue monkey handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital the makers couldnt be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically oversized critter all we know is that its not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant other than this theres absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from like i said dont get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay the first half of the film is entertaining enough with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters an 80yearold blind and alcoholic lady but the second half when the entire hospital is put to quarantine is dreadfully boring it is also near the end that blue monkey begins to exaggeratedly ripoff older and better films approaching the climax they apparently ran out of budget as well since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isnt very well camouflaged anymore blue monkey is worth a peek in case youre really bored or if you really want to see every 80s horror movie ever made fans of bcinema may recognize john vernon killer klowns from outer space curtains in the small and meaningless role of roger whos in charge of the clinic
