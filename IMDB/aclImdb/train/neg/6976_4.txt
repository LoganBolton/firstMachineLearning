robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand altmans pacing is deliberately slow theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly  from
