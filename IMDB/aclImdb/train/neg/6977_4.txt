ive read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film i cant say that i found much to recommend it the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavyhanded but dreary beyond measure the film looks authentic enough but somethings got to happen for it to work and nothing much does a cursory plot not a real problem for me not much character development nothing thematically it just slogs along flawed as it is ciminos heavens gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film id sooner watch again for a brilliant reconception of the west hbos deadwood is much superior to mccabe
