mccabe and mrs miller takes place in the turnofthecentury pacific northwest into a soggy muddy mining camp john mccabe a hirsute warren beatty comes barging full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloonwhorehouse for the town replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history he also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alphamale credentials amongst the locals and thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hourbr br it looks to be a rather sorry operation until mrs miller julie christie shows up on a startling contraption thats halfrailroad car halfautomobile where did altman find that thing mrs miller immediately takes on mccabe as a business partner with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering noting that mccabe doesnt know how to add she also insists on handling the accounts its not clear what mccabes function will bebr br the plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer mccabe to buy him out for five grand mccabe tells them to buzz off  hes holding out for fifteen thousand the company finds negotiation distasteful so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill mccabe    though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as mccabes function in the whorehouse partnership excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesnt cut the mustard when one considers that any rewardmoney offered by the local marshal would be pretty tempting br br mccabe and mrs miller purportedly classic seventies cinema should be a lot better than it is the movie tells a pretty good story the main characters have the potential to be interesting there are some striking scenes especially one involving what looks to be a 14yearold stonecold killer but its really really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing once again this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness according to the triviasheet here on imdb the movies editor griped to altman that the sound was muddy altman disagreed and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movies release altman blamed the editor nice along with the bad sound the movie has an atrocious look only robert altman can hire a worldclass dp like vilmos zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have got to be kidding me the interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum the exterior photography is even worse its as if altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees during the climactic stretch when beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snowfall that reminds one of a rankinbass christmas specialbr br look  i cant watch a movie under these conditions get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes when you remove all that annoying altmanesque overlapping dialog and when you wipe the lenses with some windex or something 3 stars out of 10
