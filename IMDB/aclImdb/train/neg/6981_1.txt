how they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me this movie is absolutely terrible i discovered after reading some of the other reviews that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film which deeply puzzles me because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution its not just that its a bad movie with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible for example we see donald sutherland running around with a huge fat ugly mole on his face he does not normally have a mole the mole does not add to his character it is extremely ugly and distracting its not like robert de niros mole its much worse why the hell has he got that mole its as if the filmmakers just said lets see how could we make this movie even worse than it already is i know lets give mr sutherland a giant uglyass mole right on his facebr br another example of the filmmakers stupidity is the character ned we see for the first threequarters of the movie young ned at one point six months later appears on the screen we see ned again and it is of course the same actor playing the boy five minutes later three weeks later appears on the screen and all of a sudden weve got a different actor playing as the now older ned what do they think were idiots good god again its like the filmmakers are saying how can we possibly make it any worse i dont think we canoh wait i just had a terrible idea i know a kid doesnt grow much in half a year which is fine but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks just dont get another actor to play ned or at least get him to play the five minutes when hes three weeks younger furthermore the kid who plays the older ned does not look any older than young ned as a matter of fact he just looks completely different much skinnier and no taller or older than the original actor which is very confusing as i like any rational human being thought at first that it was a new and different characterbr br what did the first kid die while they were filming the movie because he was in it for the first hour and a half and then all of a sudden three weeks later the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrels is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie and even if the original actor did die the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role and reshoot the measly five minutes of six months later scenes better yet just scrap the movie completely never finish it and never release never even tell anybody about it because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all timebr br im not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldnt watch it its so bad that you should watch it just to see how badly it sucks its terrible terrible
