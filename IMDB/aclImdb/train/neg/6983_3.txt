revolution is a terrible movie i dont care if youre a history teacher news writer al pacino fan theres no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate 10br br the key point to the plot is tom dobb al trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat everything revolves around that note toms son joins the army to make up for the note making tom join the army as well they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat the endbr br it had a few battle scenes and they were pretty mediocre at best transistions between scenes used five months later and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle the love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow so save your notes and watch the patriot instead
