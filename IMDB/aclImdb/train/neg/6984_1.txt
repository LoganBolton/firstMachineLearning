this movie was promising my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war it had memories from dances with wolves for the big prairies indians military fights  from barry lyndon for the british  candles lights atmospheresbr br unfortunately the script is awful the continuity of the story is lacking cuts with 5 months later 3 years later  the romance is so ridiculous that its hard to believe in it america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other above all wait for the ending  you understand how to kill a story imagine the same in titanicbr br sometimes a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker unfortunately bis hudson is a poor one he has already committed greystoke and i find again the same flaws no dynamic in scenes in editing in scoring it is long dull flatbr br i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacinos career now i understand finally this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me a painful one
