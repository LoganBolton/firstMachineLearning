i cant figure al pacino out i watch him in the godfather scarface carlitos way and i think i am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years then i see him in two for the money any given sunday and revolution and i wonder what the guy is thinkingbr br i stumbled on revolution a few nights ago and thought i would invest the next two hours on this here is a news flash want to get prisoners to talk force them to watch this over and overtheyll confess to anythingbr br i wont rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot but it does take place during the american revolution and pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but ultimately does while he has no money no education and dresses like a caveman a very hot natasha kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue togetherbr br quite frankly if al smith starred in this movie instead of al pacino it would have ruined their career the script was horrible but pacinos demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse donald sutherlands role was laughable i really cant describe it natasha kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie in fact nobody speaks much in this moviebr br one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield its like the entire northeast is a starbucks hey funny to see you here again on another battlefield 100 miles awaysee you in a few monthsbr br i am required to give this one star by imdb since there is nothing here for a negative score
