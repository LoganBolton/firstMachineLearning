im all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war this aint it and for that matter neither was the emmerichdevlingibson the patriot but i digressbr br i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios now sony just before it came out the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran robert dillon directed by the esteemed hugh hudson of chariots of fire fame and starring al pacinobr br but it didnt take long for people to start squirming in their seats whispering derisive comments about pacinos horribly misconceived accent  he was supposed to be an american frontiersman of scottish ancestry  and that of nastassja kinski who was supposed to be recently emigrated from england then the story started and it all went downhill fastbr br motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context what there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officerpederast his accent was all over the map too i guess there werent any english actors availablebr br lots of people left those who stayed tried to stifle giggles then openly guffawed i stuck it out  i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good i was wrong inexplicably hudson chose to film them with handheld cameras not even steadicam the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel authenticity which ruined the sense of scalebr br there was a semifamous tv reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me the late gary franklin of channel 7 eyewitness news i could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us and sure enough on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a 10 on his notorious franklin scale of 1 to 10 while remarking churlishly about the louts whod disrupted the screening the night before who clearly didnt know art when they saw it what a buffoonbr br after this disaster pacino didnt star in another film for almost 4 years hugh hudsons career never recovered you cant say i didnt warn you
