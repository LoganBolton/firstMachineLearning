the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a worldwide chaos as flesheating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesnt deserve to be called horror its not even thrilling just ridiculouseven the flintstones or kukla fran and ollie will give you more excitement its like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shoppingmall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside are not better either even though they doesnt seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this
