what a great word reimagining is isnt that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv 2004 a clever word indeed  it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining though it played a rolebr br still why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it its like colescliffs notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing schemebr br so whats wrong with this one well ill start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apartbr br this setup leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story its noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romeros film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this reimagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesnt bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you dont care when or who goes what matters is how they gobr br what else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story its really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from its number one spot in the box office well done zombies
