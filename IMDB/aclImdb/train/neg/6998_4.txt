hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture strange cargo proves to be no exception although utilizing the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by robert planck the movie fails dismally on the credibility score perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewers involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept bathedinlight ian hunters smug knowitall as a christ figure and the censors in boston detroit and providence at least agreed with me the movie was banned few bostondetroitprovidence moviegoers if any complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture it flopped everywherebr br oddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv a home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers however despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable heavily moralistic lines that will have noone guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny
