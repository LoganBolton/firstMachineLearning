probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever badly acted and badly writtenbr br the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll or could it be one of the five charactersbr br acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the endbr br the kills cant really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alivebr br overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
