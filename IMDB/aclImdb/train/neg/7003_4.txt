aka trinity is still my name this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european boxoffice success of they call me trinity only this time joseph e levine and avcoembassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well too bad they didnt get very far since the hillspencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the us and this largely boring drawnout film doesnt help it out anybr br trinity and bambino swear to their dying father harry carey jr that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other they later get involved with armstraffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery and who mistakenly think theyre a pair of federal agents it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and dont know how to carry themselves and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as wellbr br the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsborolike early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good not sure if id want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others mightbr br the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldnt have dragged on for so long it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here in fact i lost interest in it about 23rds of the way through the dvd is also terrible with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the skybr br a big step down from the previous filmbr br 4 out of 10
