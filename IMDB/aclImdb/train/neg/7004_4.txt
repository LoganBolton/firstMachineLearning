the author of numerous novels plays and short stories w somerset maugham 18741965 was considered among the worlds great authors during his lifetime and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public published in 1944 the razors edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values it was maughams last major noveland it was immensely popular given that the novels conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues it was also an extremely odd choice for a film versionbut darryl f zannuck of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publicationbr br according to film lore the razors edge was to be directed by the legendary george cukor from a screenplay by maugham himselfand it does seem that maugham wrote an adaptation when the film went into production however cukor was replaced by edmund goulding a director less known for artistic touch than a workmanlike manner and the maugham script was replaced with one by lamar trotti the author of such memorable screenplays as the oxbow incident tyrone power recently returned from military service during world war ii was cast as the spiritually conflicted larry darrell gene tierney one of the great beauties of her era was cast as socialite isabell bradley the supporting cast was particularly notable including herbert marshall anne baxter clifton webb lucille watson and elsa lanchester both budget and shooting schedule were lavish and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alikebr br but time has a way of putting things into perspective seen today the razors edge is indeed a beautifully produced filmbut that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity as in most cases the major problem is the script although it is reasonably close to maughams novel in terms of plot it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment we are told that he receives it we are told he acts on itbut in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual artistic philosophical and intellectual processes behind any of it we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself it has the effect of cutting off the story at its kneesbr br we are left with the shell of maughams plot which centers on the relationship between larry and isabell a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them tyrone power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support unfortunately that does not happen here they are extremely onenote and power is greatly miscast to boot fortunately the supporting cast is quite good with herbert marshall clifton webb and lucille watson particularly so the thenfamous performance by anne baxter however has not worn as well as one would hopebr br with a running time of just under two and a half hours the film also feels unnecessarily long there is seemingly endless cocktail partytype banter and indeed the entire india sequence which reads as faintly hilarious would have been better cut entirelyan odd situation for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film regardless of the specific scene it all just seems to go on and on to no actual pointbr br as for the dvd itself the film has not been remastered but the print is extremely good and while the bonus package isnt particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor when all is said and done i give the razors edge four stars for production values and everyones willingness to take on the materialbut frankly this a film best left power and tierney fans who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itselfbr br gft amazon reviewer
