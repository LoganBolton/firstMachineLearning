mark hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with corvette summer this time he uses a new kind of force to regain the possession of his dream machine a bright red vette it looks like another sour teenage flick the first halfhour and does a uturn in heading for the wrong direction the writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done with a few scenes you cant hardly take youre expecting this to happen anyway and youre also sniffing the smell of late70s hodgepodge only a former newcomer like annie potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit hooray for annie sorry mark i guess the force wasnt with you this time around
