this is a pretty bad movie the plot is sentimental mush i suppose the production values are ok decent photography unobtrusive direction and all that mark hamill was terrible ive never cared much for him and this movie validates that perception its no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his star wars films ill just say buhbye mark as he sinks into welldeserved obscurity on the other hand a very young annie potts utterly stole the show she showed charm beauty and acting chops all in one performance i remember seeing her in texasville recently and taking note of her beauty its interesting seeing her from ten years earlier anyway unless you are interested in miss potts run away from this film screaming for the hills
