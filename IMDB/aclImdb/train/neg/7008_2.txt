annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joybr br i would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
