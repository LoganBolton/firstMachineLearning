54 is a film based on the infamous studio 54 of the 1970s  the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers in the film ryan phillippe is the main character based on an actual employee of studio from 1977  1982br br the films problem is that its all glitter and style and no substance it tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like boogie nights but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe mike myers is given the thankless task of playing cocainesnorting club owner steve rubell its only a slightly comedic role and if this was myers best attempts at sliding into drama like lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time its a total failurebr br 54 could have been insightful and interesting but instead its just another dumb teen flick that isnt entertaining or even remotely engaging view at your own peril
