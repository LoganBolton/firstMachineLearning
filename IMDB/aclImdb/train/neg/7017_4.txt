if you hit your teens in the 70s as i did you probably remember the stories about studio 54 whether or not you liked disco an exclusive club it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and selfabsorption theres even an excellent vh1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating filmbr br sadly this isnt it 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees a bartender named shane ryan phillippe a busboy named greg breckin meyer his wife a coatcheck girl anita selma hayek and of course the master of ceremonies himself steve rubell mike meyers while the goingson at the club are well represented this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers following shanes story the closestbr br the movie works in spurts sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture such as when shane is taken to a dinner party and doesnt know who errol flynt is and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama some of that is inherent in the premise  following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous  but a lot of it is due to the kidgloved treatment with which both the club and rubell are given throughout the movie while rubell certainly electrified the scene in new york with his penchant for overthetop spectacle and his exclusive handpicking of the crowds each night the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on and rubell himself while his excesses are mentioned come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar a cheat a drug abuser and promiscuous as all hell not that i was looking for the man to be pilloried here but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate a final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurdbr br meyers does his best to capture rubell but hes given so little to work with here its surprising his performance is effective but hes good and he helps to anchor the film philippe whom i find generally to be a good actor is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character hes limited to a deerintheheadlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown and even he cant translate that into a strong performance hayek and meyer are both okay again undercut by the writing and neve campbell  prominently featured on the dvd cover  appears so briefly she really has an extended cameobr br for some reason i still find myself interested even fascinated by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies but even given that this is not a film that particularly engaged me despite a predisposition to like it id say if that era or that club has any interest for you track down the vh1 special rather than this middleoftheroad melodrama
