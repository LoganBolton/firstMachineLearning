over christmas break a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings to make the work a bit more difficult a murderous chuckswearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm preying on the group in various violent waysbr br registered as one of the 74 video nasties listed by the uk in the 1980s the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing the term video nasty strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore violence sex etc all the things a horror fan dreams of so after hearing all of that info i settled into pranks alt title expecting a sleazy slasher experience   and thats what it tried to be but failed pretty much completely visually the films not great the cinematography gore except for a couple scenes and overall direction all fail its simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster but thats about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems unimportant the killer isnt cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid its a bit boring overall for a film done by a few ucla film students for 90000 which would be over double that today the dorm that dripped blood isnt a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable   but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces   it just cannot compare dont expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to say it but this is one of the few films ive seen that would actually be better with a remake   and yet they go after great works like black christmas oh well  br br obligatory horror elementsbr br  subgenre slasherbr br  violencegore there are some brutally cool kills and the gore is okay for the most part   but nothing special also they offscreened some of the best murdersbr br  sexnudity theres a little unappealing to me nudity but not very muchbr br  cool killers nah the ending monologues of the killer made himher pretty uncoolbr br  scaressuspense a jump scare or two but nothing too effectivebr br  mystery i suppose yeah but i simply didnt care enough and its as obvious as the nose on the killers facebr br   br br final verdict 37510 bah humbug br br ap3
