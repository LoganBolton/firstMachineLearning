i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female but other than that i cant really recommend this movie the characters arent really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didnt finish the movie id skip this one
