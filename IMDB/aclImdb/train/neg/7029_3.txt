phantom of the mall is a film that fits best in the easily forgotten category its a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by gaston leroux the phantom of the opera not a bad idea to itself but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story on the bright side gaston leroux doesnt has to turn over in his grave just yet it could have been a lot worse br br phantom of the mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable also the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary and even though theres a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of eric  the basic plot is ordinary and déjàvu spoilers its about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire that fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build the boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss end spoilers this pretty simple  but rather effective  plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories while it should just be an entertaining horror movie it desperately tries to be an intelligent thrillerand thats not what the fans look for there are a few innovative killings but theyre not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie and besides phantom of the mall could have used at least a bit of humor this entire production  the cast included  takes itself way too serious br br ill try to finish with a few positive aspectslike for example it stars ken foree  diehard horror fans will certainly recognize him as peter for dawn of the dead thats like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessaryit was good to see him again tvmovie fans will also recognize morgan fairchild as the mayor shes a fine actress and an elegant lady pauly shore is also in this but i cant stand himso my opinion about him may be a bit biased and finally a bit of praise for the leading actress named kari whitman shes an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talenttoo bad she never made it to the top actually this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career
