when carol vanessa hidalgo starts looking into her brothers death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sisterinlaw fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanists theyll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy waysbr br if youre into sleazy satanicthemed movies black candles has a lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic softcore sex one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world cant save black candles most of the movie is a total bore other than the one scene ive already mentioned the numerous sex scenes arent shocking and certainly arent sexy the acting is spotty at best even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance the plot really doesnt matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together im only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror black candles comes off as amateurish 310 is about the best i can do
