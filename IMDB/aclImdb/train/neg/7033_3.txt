black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us vampyres and much later rest in pieces among othersim only noting the ones ive seen at any rate we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it and the man keels over not sure if it was good for either of them at that point fast forward to where the mans sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will or something to that effect and of course everybody else except her is in on something which happens to be devil worship its really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times to spice things up though theres a simulated bestiality scene i hope its simulated with a black goat sure to be a crowd pleaser ugh at times this echoes rosemarys baby minus the baby because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too because that keeps getting remarked upon however the herbs arent the only thing that reeks about this film the end seems to be back to the beginning again and many viewers might find themselves wondering where theyve been during the middle part its not unwatchable its just not very good and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films and there wasnt much here that did anything much for me 3 out of 10
