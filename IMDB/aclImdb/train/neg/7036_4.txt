im not ruining anything when i inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie if that is your thing then your movie has arrivedbr br a woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods her sister is a creepy lady to say the least and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love on the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan ritualsbr br the plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb the woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans even continues the have sex with him on the exploitative side of things there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings but nothing that hasnt been better somewhere else oh and the aforementioned goatsex scenebr br most viewers wont make it to the end exploitation fans will ride it out but will be left wanting morebr br 410
