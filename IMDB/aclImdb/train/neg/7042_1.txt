this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made even for a biker movie its rock bottom the minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town how original and the townspeoples attempts to fight them off why dont they call for outside help who knows the fight scenes are obviously fake adam west and tina louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there understandably this movie belongs in the trash heap
