how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film tina still looked fit and attractive but for some reason seems truly frightened i can understand her fear fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public also im a fan of the likable adam west again as with tina adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age his acting here is passable but the script is so bad that its difficult to even listen to the dialogbr br the movie is a ripoff of the classic brando biker flick the wild ones outlaw biker gang is outofcontrol in a small hicktown the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldnt want them to date my sister the acting is stiff and wooden and the storyplot is as old as sand hellriders is hell to watch
