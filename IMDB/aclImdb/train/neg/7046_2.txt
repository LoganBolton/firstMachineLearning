i saw this dull waste of time on hbos comedy channel so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy but there is absolutely nothing funny here a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left buttcheek  after it had been beaten senseless by 15thcentury inquisition torturers the first half is particularly bad as it has some of the most dull pointless dialogue ive come across in a while and zero comma zero plot to speak of just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zetajones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site should tell you everything a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast but thats about itbr br this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections family connections preferably andor plenty of cash lying around
