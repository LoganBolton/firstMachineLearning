be warned neither zetajones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe their roles are in fact minorbr br the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc√© the plot drags terribly and i turned this one off after about 23  unusual for me as i like to finish what i start the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 starsbr br 210
