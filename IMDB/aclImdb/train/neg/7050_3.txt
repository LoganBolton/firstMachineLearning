note to self just because a film is foreign obscure and stars catherine zetajones doesnt mean its any good such is the case with blue juice a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem to a dumb american anyway an even more unlikely place to find surfers cornwall england you might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing quirky little comedy if only the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable the easiest way to describe it is as a sort of 90s british version of grease without the dancing but even that makes it sound better than it is no the best way to take it is as a little sliceoflife set in a small town catherine zetajones plays chloe a young woman living with a surfing instructor jc sean pertwee you remember him pertwee is actually the films star and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this in this case it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer and a fat nerdy guy who in a needlessly extended scene gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him i cant honestly say everything that goes on in blue juice is predictable since its set in a place and reflects customs and manners im not very familiar with but theres certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters the comedy though is very predictable and tired one can sense the setups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue in american form of course before the actors do the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed she wants him to grow up he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being hes afraid of losing face with his gang she thinks he prefers them to her you get the idea as i struggled to stay focused on blue juice toward the end i felt as the saying goes that this was an hour and half of my life id never get back
