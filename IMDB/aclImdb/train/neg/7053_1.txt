okay the promos promised a comedy and peoplefew went to watch it being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing or for that matter of any year because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some morebr br okay coming to jawani diwanibr br review in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly its annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina jaitleybr br cringeworthy dialogues comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholesbr br direction is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost its touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible
