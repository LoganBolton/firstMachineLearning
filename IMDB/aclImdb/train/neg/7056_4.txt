this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasnt half as goodbr br the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking ban jo bole etc are genuinely good jokes but i dont know whom to blame this movie flop onbr br the prime candidates may be 1 the hammers  actors and hammeresses actresses and not even the funny kind 2 the director 3the guy who cast the actors andor the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the filmbr br ps the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
