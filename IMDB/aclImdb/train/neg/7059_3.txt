about five minutes in and i saw where this was heading bunch of high school kids get annoyed by the schools administration and thoughts of rebellion start fomenting i said to my girlfriend if it gets below a 5 on imdb ill go and read a book it got 50 so she persuaded me to go on watching what are the good things well it is a good thing this film does not have a story because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing its like the students drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meatgrinder and left half the stock destroyed with the other half spliced into twosecond bits even in a tensecond scene of the local tv news there are about six cuts and three different angles and then there are the montages these are all set to electronic music which forewarns you of yet another montage so that like pavlovs dog you start cringing every time you hear it which is about every three minutes oh i was supposed to say whats good about this film well the film was shot very well with a nice color palette that nicely matched the emotional content  such as there was  of the scenes okay now with the films major flaw and it wasnt the story or lack thereof the director made that fatal mistake of leading you astray about people and situations not by clever storytelling but by being highly selective about what to show about the main characters thats just cheating i guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable but it just became plain annoying if the story is full of holes its no good trying to patch it up by misdirecting the viewer and often there wasnt even any point to it and then the ending basically the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy if a coward plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie that you should stand up for a just cause on its head by the already mentioned misdirection and makes it into a point about the nature of revolutions that was already made and much better by animal farm it also committed what i call the bill cosby sin no matter how things may seem at first in the end adults are always right and children always wrong and lets face it unless youre me thats just not true
