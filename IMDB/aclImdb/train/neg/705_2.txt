theres so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense some of the charactersintense and surprising charactersdont make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that theres no reason for their existencebr br wheres the relationship between christophe and marcel wheres the continued affair between marcel and juliet why does dolly rose appear at all since her storys never explained wheres the rape and redemption of marie whose greatest attribute and downfall is that she can pass for whiteand her marriage to richard why does the film end with marcels beating at the hands of his father we learn nothing of aglae beyond that shes a bitch who hates her husband why no backstory explaining this hatred br br as for the performances theres not a one thats better than mediocre though thats likely due to the lousy script best of the lot is that of the actor playing richardbut richards not on screen enough to salvage the film worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little shes given to work withbr br all in all this is just terrible i thought itd be impossible for any anne rice bookturned film to be worse than exit to eden but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit how is it that rice is such a slut shell allow her best works to become such junk on the screen
