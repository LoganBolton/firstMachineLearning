im still trying to figure out if there was a point to this filmbr br for content thats supposed to be so rebellious and controversial the things that maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily swayed by vague antiauthoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets rebel everybodybr br i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesnt get set offbr br apparently a huge fight up on the football fields is a fight that consists of two peoplebr br characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random a football jock who maddox was fighting and who subsequently got a staple on the face is all smiles and apologies the next daybr br the fact that it doesnt come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudoglitch soundtrack
