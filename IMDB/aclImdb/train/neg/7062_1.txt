ok not possibly honestly the worst movie ive ever seenbr br this made absolutely no sense there was no plot no characterization no acting just nothingbr br heres what i thought when i first saw it may 28th 2003 caution this is a spoiler alert its also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie isbr br ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced but there is no character explanation as far as i knew the main character was new to this school but apparently not also it appeared that he lived by himself then that he was a foster kid then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselvesbr br now we come to a main plot point this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus intently on him for the contingency of the movie i think i must have missed a main plot element here there was no reason for the main character to get hooked even if thats the point having no reason why do all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before suddenly follow him and do what he wantsbr br so the movie continues on and it gets all right theyre running havoc on the school blah blah blah but wait a minute suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the show here wait a second didnt the insane guy specifically tell the main character not to do that it was supposed to be anynomousbr br ah another important plot element has been skipped over the insane guy was supposed to not be insane everyone said he wasnt insane but as the story goes on he is very clearly out of his mind but i thought the news people said he wasnt hmbr br now the movie comes to a close that was the close what the hell was that not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character it didnt answer any questions about the insane guy are these people in the same situation if yes then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this if no then what is the point in saying thats you in two weeksbr br end of the thingbr br thats what i thought then that is pretty much what i still think now its 6 months down the line and if i can get it for free i might give it another chance but i doubt it i highly doubt it
