the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can  cause after all im a title designer  and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst ive even seen thats for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters dont waste your time watching thisbr br it kinda ironic dont you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none
