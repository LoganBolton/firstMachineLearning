john hughes son wrote a high school drama wow i thought as i checked the flicks info here on imdb late on a saturday night having found myself watching the opening credits on bbc2br br ive just finished watching it and sadly it was downhill from there on arguably you cant spoil a film this poor but ill leave the spoilers out of this review br br theres an awful lot of style over very little substance unfortunately the style hasnt dated too well in the eight years since its release as for the substance the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of schoollife but beneath the shiny veneer a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise characters are painted in childishly broad strokes falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writers father sought to question in breakfast club br br director kyle cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information which soon becomes a tiresome device but at least pushes the story along but his efforts dont sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting how anyone is supposed to side with maddox when blake shields gurns and glowers his way through the part i just cant understand not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes im all for creative license but when the bad guys know the identities of the good guys making their lives a misery but fail to act in any way to stop them you really have to wonder why this script didnt undergo another few redrafts before production  did daddy even read itbr br im sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film and all power to them but theyre really better off sticking with hughes srs high school output and if the idea of schooltime rebellion is what really appeals the 1968 classic if is a much more satisfying examination of the subject
