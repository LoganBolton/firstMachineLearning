ok well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked ok the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into then the one with the boy was completely retarded it wasnt even scary his dream sounds like a little kids bedtime story then the news girls one was completely retarded too im sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on tv and he said all that junk to her next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead peopleomg its so stupid im not even going to say any more about itthe last one was the best it wasnt that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cooluh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something then when theyre all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus to hell ahahahah and they see all the people from their dreams on the busha the end
