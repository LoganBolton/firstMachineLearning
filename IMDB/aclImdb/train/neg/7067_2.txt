five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up but is there more to these nightmares than meets the eyebr br lucky me five bad movies for the price of one each segment features the very worst in acting special effects make up and music and these were supposed to be scary hmm i think ive been more freaked out during an episode of teletubbies i swear youll sit there like i was bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen dont bother it never does in fact i even stopped fast forwarding the commercials as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature and the ending is the ultimate copout yep none of this actually ever happened if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this cobblers 210
