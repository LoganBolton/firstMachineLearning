chillers starts on a cold dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passengers outside a bus station a young boy named mason jesse emery a college professor dr howard conrow david wohl  a woman named sharon phillips laurie pennington inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus  are stranded for the night in the waiting area they find two other people ronnie jim wolf  a sleeping woman named lindsay marjorie fitzsimmons who is currently having a terrifying nightmarebr br while swimming in an indoor pool lindsay encounters  befriends guy named billy waters jesse johnson the next time lindsay sees billy he dives into the pool  then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces shortly after lindsay discovers that billy water died in a diving accident 5 years agobr br lindsay wakes up  tells the others about her nightmare everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently  decide to share them to pass the timebr br next up is mason who tells a story of how he  two friends scott david r hamm  jimmy will tuckwiller are terrorised during a camping tripbr br then its sharon whose story revolves around a newsman named tom williams thom delventhal who she phones up in no time at all tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a vampirebr br its ronnies turn next  he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer nelson caulder bradford boll back to homicidal lifebr br finally dr conrow tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient aztec wargod named ixpe kimberly harbour back to lifebr br then its back to the bus station for one last predictable twistbr br written produced  directed by daniel boyd chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies ive ever seen  i usually really like this subgenre the script by boyd lacks what is needed for films such as chillers to work you can see the final twist coming a mile off  each story is really lame the first one is totally pointless  didnt seem to have an ending  the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist the second story is predictable  again just ends without any payoff so it continues throughout chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch  have no reward for doing so the characters  dialogue are poorly written the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own  as a whole the film totally sucks at least each story doesnt last long  i liked the idea behind the linking segmentsbr br director boyd was obviously working with a very low budget  it shows all i can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then chillers is for you the stories are neither clever scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything having said that it does have a few nice scenes  some surprising competence shines through on occasion violence  gore wise there isnt much happening in chillers a ripped out heart a decapitated head  a bitten off hand is as gory as it getsbr br technically chillers is poor stuff that wont impress anyone basic cinematography bad music cheap special effects  below average production values chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever period the acting is also of a very low standardbr br i am sure a lot of effort was put into chillers as a low budget film  at least the filmmakers tried so i will give credit for that at least but that still doesnt stop me from thinking its crap similar anthology films like tales from the crypt 1972 asylum 1972 the vault of horror 1973 dr terrors house of horrors 1965 creepshow 1982  tales from the darkside the movie 1990 are far superior to chillers so watch one of those instead
