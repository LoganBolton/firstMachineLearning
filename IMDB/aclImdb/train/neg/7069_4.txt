when the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the blockbuster but honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser the movie has a tagline  preeti madhura tyaga amara which means loves sweet but sacrifice is immortal in the movie the hero of the movie ganesh sacrifices his love for the leading lady pooja gandhi even though the two loved each other his justification is the meaning of the tagline this movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this loserlike sacrificial attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is when they could have moved on with their lives ganeshs acting in the movie is amateurish crass and childishly stupid he actually looks funny in a song onde ondu sari when hes supposed to look all stylish and cool his looks dont help the leading role either his hair style is badly done in most part of the movie pooja gandhi cant act her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent br br the good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by mano murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie also the lyrics by jayant kaikini are very well penned the director yograj bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner br br anyway allinall except for the songs the movie is a very ordinary one
