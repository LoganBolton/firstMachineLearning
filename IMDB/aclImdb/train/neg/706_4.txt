the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies richard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one of my favorite actors i love anne rice im currently reading the vampire chronicles but im glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but its just not my type of show
