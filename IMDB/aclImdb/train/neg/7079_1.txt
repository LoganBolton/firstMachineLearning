no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in troublebr br it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really isnt anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a pointbr br boring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette arent enough to save this film
