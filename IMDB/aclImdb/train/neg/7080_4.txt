this movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesnt have any of this in it it doesnt give any insight or solutions to the problem its just the portrayal of old male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family why would you want to watch this its all so totally pointless and meaninglessbr br it also really doesnt help that the main character is some wrinkly 50 year old male youll have a hard time identifying yourself and sympathize for him he just seems like a dirty old playboy who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex he has all kinds of sexual intercourses about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutesbr br it also doesnt have a bad visual style though it all feels a bit forced but nevertheless its all better looking than most other directtovideo productions who knows if the filmmakers had been given better material to work with the movie would had deserved a better faithbr br the story really gets ridicules at times there are really some pointless plotlines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be im talking about for instance the whole ordell plotline things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending also the whole way the story is being told cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main characters sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simplebr br but as far as bad movies are concerned this just isnt one of them its not really any better or worse than any other random straighttovideo flick with similar conceptsbr br still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast nastassja kinski and ed begley jr in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is guess they were really desperate for work and moneybr br 410
