i really tried to like this movie it deals with an important problem in any society sex addictionbr br in this story we learn that you can lose everything when youre addicted to sex in this case our main character and hero for having nonstop sex with all kinds of women crazy kinky neurotic puts in jeopardy his marriage job and even his lifebr br the production values are terrible mainly the acting oh you wont enjoy any of the sex scenes most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think youre watching a home made flickbr br second the plot is just non sense how could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband how could she believe him the threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a whilebr br also the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking wtf br br scenes like those you will find plenty br br avoid this movie please avoid it its not soft core its not a documental its not a dramatic feature its a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whateverbr br only mrs kinskis legs on display are worth the watch i caught it on hbo and im glad i didnt spend my money on it but those 90 minutes of my life wont come back
