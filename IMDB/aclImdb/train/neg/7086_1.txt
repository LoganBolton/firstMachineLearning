this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70s when late night networks showed movie of the week horror flicks shot invideo it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i cant say that it is pleasant to watchbr br nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i cant fault her for someone elses poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but shes outside her range with thisbr br alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrewbr br finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying muchbr br this has to be the worst film i have seen in years
