br br this movie not a film  clearly recorded on a cheap camcorder may be one of the greatest cinematic stinkbombs in history beware the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sexaddiction the film is not an exploration of anything and it is no more erotic than staring at ones own warts the script is pointless and meandering with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes however even the sex scenes are lame lame lame except for the first they are around three seconds long then again maybe my version was cut and comically overwroughtbr br if you are looking for a decent film you dont want this if you are looking for a titillating sexflick you dont want this whatever your lifes goals desires or perspectives you do not want to watch this movie how they got rosanna arquette natashia kinski and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme
