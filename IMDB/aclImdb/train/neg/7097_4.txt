this movie has such inexorable b class cheapness to all its scenes effects etc as to make you think they spent 80 of their budget on connery its like watching some wing commander stuff after star wars quite apart from contentbr br story can be described in one word flat and oh my god i cant remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago were given neither a reason hes so wicked an inborn defect were lead to think nor any real convincedness or flair to his wickednessbr br if youre out for connery rather go rent hunting forrester
