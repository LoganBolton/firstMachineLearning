ok i admit i watched this movie on mystery science theater 3000 which i am a huge fan of but i am not one of those people who automatically gives an mst3k movie a 110 rating although i hate many of the movies they play and some are among of the worst movies ive ever seen i have actually been able to enjoy some mst3k movies that being said this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen it is no wonder in fact that the mst3k writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst dont believe me check out their sitebr br to me this movie is a good example of what not to do in filmmaking the dialogue is very bad the acting is worse the cinematography is pathetic the direction while perhaps being the best thing in this movie is badbr br the pacing is the worst part in this movie a few times in this movie the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen while minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time it can be in a movie particularly in this one im sure it was meant to create a mood but i was just very bored it truly felt like ten minutesbr br if suspension of disbelief means almost falling asleep during a movie then this has plenty of that but the screaming skull is just so horrible there is no way i could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film and thus the suspension of disbelief was indeed nonexistantbr br one of the worst and probably the most boring movie ive ever seenbr br 110
