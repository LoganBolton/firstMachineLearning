i am not a big fan of horror films and have only seen a handful of them and none of the halloweens or friday the thirteenths  but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore and im pretty sure this isnt scarybr br  whats so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere in all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots so theres no real surprise in any of this film not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway but   br br  the plot concerns claus von bulows third cousin john hudson who marries a donnareed lookalike peggey webber giving one of the worst performances ever who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husbands mansion did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident ooooh wonder who did itbr br  this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill andor drive their wife insane if you want to see a welldone version of this stuff try reversal of fortune and btw jeremy irons is one hundred times more talented than john hudsonbr br  the msting was okay but nothing special paired with the gumby short however it makes for good viewingbr br  two stars for the screaming skull eight stars for the mst3k versionbr br  and now to paraphrase mr von bulow himself how bad is this film you have no idea
