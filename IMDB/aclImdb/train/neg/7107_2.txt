i am sure there is some sort of imdb cult that likes movies that mst3k made fun of after seeing both this and werewolf and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are i became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here alot of people are saying that people who hate it are only scared by gore dont know good horror or stuff like that well i dont really care for gore but i do want something to happen in a movie most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around or walking around the housegarden a movie requires something to give it atmosphoere you dont get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares oh and makes you think yeah i was thinking move you 0 one of the worst horror movie i have ever scene br br ps for the record i am a big fan of the old style of horror dracula frankenstein that kind of stuff
