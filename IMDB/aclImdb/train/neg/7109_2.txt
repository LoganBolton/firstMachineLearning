now i get it the title refers to each audience members immediate postreaction after 68 minutes of mental torture trying too hard to be terrifying lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes the screaming skull more like a snoring dull albeit the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie but thats about it the only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning that may be the funniest thing i have ever witnessed on screen sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director alex nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin nailed shut and buried alive for his lame effort jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted cranial receptacle also her husband john comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker but this doesnt work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around ah mickeyÂ…the days before you could get a restraining order against estate caretakers like him this guys approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue still despite his strange persona mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and i cant get enough of a guy saying it was mary and rummaging through pots in a greenhouse
