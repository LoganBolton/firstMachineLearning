i read rices novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truthsbr br however i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation the casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent with the obvious exception of peter gallagher who was neither blondhaired or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag the casts embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised i made it to the endbr br a warning to fans of the novel  stay away from this one
