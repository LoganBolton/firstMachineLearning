 a newlywed couple move into the home of the husbands dead former wife its not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesnt want her in the house she sees skulls all around the house but when the husband investigates he cant find anything is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house br br  this is the first time that ive watched the screaming skull without the assistance of the mst3k crew and it will in all likelihood be the last time i watch it this way can you say dull im not talking ordinary dull  im talking watching grass grow dull there are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens the screen could have gone blank and i would have gotten as much entertainment out of it the characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable the screaming skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aidebr br  the actors dont help matters much most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play i havent looked it up but i would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value i wont even go into the script the actors are given to work with lets just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on filmbr br  youve been warned either avoid this one at all costs or at least seek out the mst3k version
