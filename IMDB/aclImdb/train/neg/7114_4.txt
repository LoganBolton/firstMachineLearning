as far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50s there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were nonexistent the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings i also couldnt help but think the budget didnt allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon honestlyit would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie it wasnt bad enough to be a goodbad movie but wasnt good enough to be good either get the mst3k versionits more fun
