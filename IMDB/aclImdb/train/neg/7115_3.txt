okay so the introduction with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film is so lame its funny and so the first skull scene is so drawn out and unsuspenseful its funny the actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent theres at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go the acting is average not truly bad br br altogether this movie doesnt quite fall flat in the way a 110 movie would its not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest if i just read the screenplay id say there was potential for this to be a decent movie its just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie so its a bad movie but there are much worse ones out there
