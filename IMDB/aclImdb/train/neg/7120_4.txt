i first saw this movie on mst3k and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes i dont particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcocklike plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the nonmst3k version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake
