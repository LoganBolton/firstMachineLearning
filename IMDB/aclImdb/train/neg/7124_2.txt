a man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an accident his new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich all of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead br br youve probably guessed the ending so i wont spell it out i saw this many times on saturday afternoon tv as a kid back then i liked it but i was young seeing it now i realize how bad it is its horribly acted badly written very dull even at an hour and has a huge cast of five people one being the director still it does have some good things about it br br the music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric there also are a few scary moments i jumped a little when she saw the first skull and a somewhat effective ending all in all its definitely not a good moviebut not a total disaster either it does have a small cult following i give it a 2br br also try to avoid the elite dvd drivein edition of it its paired with attack of the giant leeches its in terrible shape with jumps and scratches all over it didnt even look this bad on tv
