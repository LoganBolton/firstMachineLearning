when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy xander and figured ah how nice that hes still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that its a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theorys that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people nazis who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers i was surprised they didnt mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i dont condone drugs like i dont condone this movie it should be burned shredded and forgotten just so good ol xander might get another acting job it wasnt his acting though that was alright but the script just didnt make any sense sorry
