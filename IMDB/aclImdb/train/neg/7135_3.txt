im sorry to say that there isnt really any way in my opinion that an enzo would really be able to keep up with a saleen s7 twin turbo the power to weight advantage possessed by the s7 would just be too great the s7 has a powerweight ratio of 393 lbshp while the enzo has 461 lbshp the s7s low end is much better too sorry ferrari fans but the saleen just gets it done so much betterbr br as for other parts of this film i just have to say its so substandard as to be pathetic the story is way too weak the acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soapsbr br i can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death toobr br i cant give the film a 1 star rating because it didnt compel me to actually walk out of the theater i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmalalthough there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of varietybr br ps the guy who plays jason is sooooo the skid row version of james vanderbeek
