i registered just to make this comment which pretty much echos some of the ones here already the acting is worse than subpar it expounds on commonly held stereotypes has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification all bod no brain and has some of the cheesiest lines known to manbr br including but not limited to allright lets see what these guys can do i should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves eddie griffins character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way he may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesnt allow for that kind of character exploration you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys oceans 11 this movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audiencebr br even the cars cant make up for this fluke of a movie that enzo that griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly it just sucks
