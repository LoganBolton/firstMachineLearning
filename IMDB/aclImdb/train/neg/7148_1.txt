before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars eventually i even regretted going for that reason plot is almost nonexistent character development is nonexistent so many clich√©s and so much jawdropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released if not for the exotics i wouldnt have even rated this movie a 1 an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members in fact the movies plot is so predictable and simpleminded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad moviebr br dont see it play gran turismo hd instead and itll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste
