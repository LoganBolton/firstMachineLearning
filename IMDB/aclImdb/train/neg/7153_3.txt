there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time as f scott fitzgerald gregory peck and sheilah graham deborah kerr are lounging on the beach suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cryat which point she tells her lover about her sordid past this dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldnt help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all wasas dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo no one experiences moments like thisno one now how much of the rest of the film is true i cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 rolexand leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correctthe film is a lot of bunk however i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didnt seem to clear this up either br br just who were f scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like what i do know about fitzgerald however does seem different from what i saw in the film was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish id assume he wasnt was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film perhaps but if he was this bad and yet ms graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete dummyand not someone youd like to see featured in a film and if he wasnt then the film does a poor disservice to his memory either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experiencebr br the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people in a dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place the bottom lineits a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your timeeven if like me you are big gregory peck fan
