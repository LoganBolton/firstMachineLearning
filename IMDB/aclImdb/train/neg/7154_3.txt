this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew based on shielah grahams autobiography it seems like the powers that be couldnt leave well enough alone they couldnt decide if this was to be grahams story or fitzgeralds story and also how much they should softpedal whoevers story it turned out to be so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating fitzgerald and notorious ms grahampersonalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing however  and this saved the film for me  kerr has never looked lovelier and peck is as always a very handsome man they truly make a beautiful mature couple and i only wish they had better material to work with there is one scene that does work  scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs other than that the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 peyton place the best of everything
