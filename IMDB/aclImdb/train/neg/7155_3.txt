im sorry but i didnt like this doc very much i can think of a million ways it could have been better the people who made it obviously dont have much imagination the interviews arent very interesting and no real insight is offered the footage isnt assembled in a very informative way either its too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features one thing ill say is that isabella rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets all considered this only gets a 4
