dooohhh my bwainn hurrrts well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows br br maybe its memaybe i dont get the premise of the film or maybe i dont appreciate its alleged mystical atmosphere in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonaldsbr br in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom  jerry cartoon yaarrrghhh why do i do it why do i watch such tripe its enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion yaargh an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect apart from that its not to bad
