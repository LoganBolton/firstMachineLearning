this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen i love almereydas nadja but this is just absolute dreck aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material jared harris is particularly bad but no one in this is remotely good the plot is a joke but not the haha kind i dont even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad please erase the last hour and a half of my life how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet
