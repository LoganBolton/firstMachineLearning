this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult  government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulbr br part of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucbr br another big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedbr br the real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
