br br upon concluding my viewing of trance or the eternal or whatever the producers are calling this film i wondered to myself out of all of the bad movies i could have seen couldnt i have at least seen one that was entertaining even if a film is not well made in terms of acting directing writing or what have you it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile but not only is this film bad in artistic value its incredibly boring for a plot of such thinness it moves awfully slowly with little dramatic tension at the very least in a lowbrow attempt at entertainment the deaths of the characters could have been cool andor gory but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as wellbr br what does this movie have going for it pretty much nothing unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken who is capable of being brilliant put so little effort into his acting that he falls into selfparody mode why did he decide to do this film anywaybr br i give this film 310 because god help us there actually have been worse movies made before
