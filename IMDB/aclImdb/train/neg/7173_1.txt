i hate plane crash moviesall of them in fact i hate them all with a passion first of all they are cheaplooking and have no craftsmanship secondly they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do isfall out of the sky and crashbr br why i wince at such a film this could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said moviewhich is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this i hate this movie because its like all the 50000000 stupidass airplane chaos movies before it freefall is like all the others nothing more than boredom before the clich√©d bullshit dramatic scenes take place br br first off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap the cleaveresquire family of three the yuppie baastard and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from 1987 scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened br br my second gripe is this shouldnt be a fulllength movie but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada gimbli glider incident aka freefall right down to the safety precautionsbr br my third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliberwith the exception of fearless why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes i could understand high heels and sharp loose objects but cmonlike thats gonna make them any more fking safer than they are now this plane if theythe passengers didnt know any better knew they were going to crash land why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field does this make any sense to anyonebr br fearless and the hit abc series lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane malfunctionspeople panicstewards become assholesplane lands without wheels in a fieldpeople wander without shoes and jackets etc the same old crap from airport 1975 freefall was so typical of a aircrash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment could we at least see how these poorlyacted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them typical moronic lifetime movie cheap and stupid br br the director of freefall should stick to cheap madefortv movies with white middleaged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems as for suspenseleave it to the professionalsyou hack why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash i hope to god they dont make plane crash movies like this anymore if this were like the abc series lost then it would be something to watch but this is utter crap and then some stop turning every plane disaster movie into airport 1975 this is not airport this is cheap pathetic waste of my time i would not recommend this movie or any madefortv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies
