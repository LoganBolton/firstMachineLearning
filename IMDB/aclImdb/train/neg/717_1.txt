it was meant to be a parody on the lotrtrilogy but this was one of the most awful movies ive ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion i dont doubt any second that there are people wholl like this sense of humor but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers im working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years the two worst movies ive seen are the ring thing and torque i cant decide which one was worse but im happy that there a so many good movies so i dont have to think too much on this question
