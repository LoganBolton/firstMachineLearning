this is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director honda with more evidently elaborate sets  though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them witness the giant bats and rodents on display it also utilizes a surprising number of american actors joseph cotten playing the visionary scientist looks illatease and frail but then his character is supposed to be 204 years old an innocuous richard jaeckel is the photographer hero while as chief villains we get cesar romero and patricia medina both essentially campy as ive often said i grew up watching englishlanguage films dubbed in italianbut hearing hollywood actors in japanese is another thing entirely br br latitude zero feels like a juvenile version of a typical jules verne adventure and is fairly entertaining on that level indeed its preferable to hondas lowbrow variations on the monstersontherampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the setup in this case the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero  he was intended to establish himself in the underwater technologically advanced city devised by cotten to which the worlds foremost minds are being recruited were treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on romeros cave  in fact cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits via flames and laser emitted from his glove must surely count as the nadir of his acting career the other elder in the cast romero is more in his element  after all he had been the joker in the batman tv series and movie of the 1960s cotten has a scantilyclad blonde physician on his team and is assisted by a hulking asian romero on the other hand is flanked by an oriental femme fatale  who however ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts the girls brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condorwhich is among the phoniestlooking creatures you ever saw apparently a 2disc set of this one from media blasters streets on this very day
