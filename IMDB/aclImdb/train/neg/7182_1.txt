i couldnt not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel trust me double negatives are required here  its that bad this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good thank you very much has a decent melody but the lyrics are stupid beyond words i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the films bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals againbr br the only entertaining part of this movie completely unintentional by the way involves alec guinness as jacob marley dressed in a silly powder white costume guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie albert finney meanwhile blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodoscrooge finneys scrooge is so hideous a person its impossible to believe his transformationbr br steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs
