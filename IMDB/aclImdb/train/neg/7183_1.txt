this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sickbr br the songs rarely move along the story they seem to be thrown in at random the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrousbr br its not only one of the worst movies ive seen but it is definitely the worst musical ive ever seenbr br its probably only considered a classic because a christmas carol is such a classic story just because the original story was a classic doesnt mean that some cheap adaption is
