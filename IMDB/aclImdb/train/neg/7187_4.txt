here we go with other slasher movie good looking people and acting from everyone was really goodbr br few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids 20 years after they are still friends they go to huge house have fun drugs and sex no nudity for least half a hour of the movie again they start making pranks phone call all over again and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend moviebr br deaths scene really weird really odd times toobr br nice slasher movie at this part would gave 710 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointlessbr br the twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 410
