the main reason people still care about carltonbrowne of the fo is that it features peter sellers in a secondbilled role but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistakebr br sellers plays amphibulos a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirtpoor island nation of gaillardia formerly a british colony now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war amphibulos wants to play both uk and soviet interests against each other for easy profit everything very friendly and all our cards under the table terrythomas is the title character a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasnt forgotten them all appearances to the contrarybr br a positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated i would argue that the reason carltonbrowne is considered below average is because the comedy is nonexistentbr br after a decent opening that establishes the films only two strengths a sympathetically doltish terrythomas and john addisons fullon larky score things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes the low opinion of carltonbrowne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia which no one can find on a map is milked to death by the time we actually reach the island after a labored series of airsick jokes expectations are quite lowbr br theyre still too high though the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade the army is apparently still horse drawn allowing for another lame aural gag by a thickaccented announcer in war the army uses many horsebr br sellers never quite takes center stage even when were on his characters island the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his fathers assassination bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written normally this would make him the likely target for scenestealing by sellers but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year the mouse that roared and im all right jackbr br strange that this film like jack was a boulting brothers production with roy boulting here serving as codirector alongside jeffrey dell usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anythinggoes comedy but here there are only fey jabs in either direction amphibulos works his mangledenglish vibe for all its worth this man is like how do you say the bull in the chinese ship while carltonbrowne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deservebr br the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loriss romance with ilyena score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressedbr br the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one and a final bit of action by carltonbrowne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally apparently he lives to see another day but the film of the same name is strictly doa
