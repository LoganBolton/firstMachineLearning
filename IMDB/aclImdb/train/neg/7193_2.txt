i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend and tagged along with my friends to check out a movieany movie and since the only movie wed not seen was inspector gadget we decided to go in for thatbr br big mistake this is a movie that might appeal only to kids oh and its not like i dont enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention if you have nothing to do at home go to sleep better than wasting hardearned cash on this go check out the film if youre a kid or if youre a parent with a kid
