disneys done it again the company that made mr magoo and george of the jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and keeps none of the spirit of the originalbr br inspector gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when i was a young one and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then now that that movie does exist i was severely disappointed even outragedbr br first we have the charactersbr br gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon with welldone special effects accompanying them and he even has some of the naivete of the original gadget but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while penny and brain just watchbr br penny has little to do while she played a major role in the cartoon discovering the crime and halting it and occasionally getting captured by the mad agents now she is simply introduced and then forgotten although she does at least sneak into claws basebr br claw is the movies version of dr claw who was a rather sinister raspyvoiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand with no mystery behind the characterbr br brain and mad cat exist in the movie but are rather insignificant to itbr br even small parts of the cartoon arent spared in this butchering the famous expression wowsers was mysteriously changed to wowser and gadgets gadgetmobile now looks different and talksbr br there is even product endorsements everywhere why is yahoo advertised on a sign why does the gadgetmobile have buttons for mms or skittlesbr br fans of the cartoon will hate it others might will likely find the movie below par and when all is said and done this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show
