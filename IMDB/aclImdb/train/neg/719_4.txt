this film though ostensibly a comedy is deadly serious its subject is imperialism with a capital i how britain foolishly humiliatingly tries to convince itself that its still a great power after world war ii at home the empire is run by amiable dolts benevolent tories who are so inbred that they cant distinguish close relatives the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives a dig at orwellian paranoia inhabited by indolent rats and anterooms wherein lounge bored synacures reading popular novelsbr br abroad britain clings to the old pomp but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly especially when its embodied in bumbling twits carltonbrowne is an unsentimental picture of decline with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly antiimperialist jewel in the crownbr br the film is also about the cold war bravely admitting that its a dangerous farce whose participants deserve mockery and contempt not fear and respect its about how colonialism characterised more by neglect than tyranny destroys the colonies it deserts robbing them of amenities power and most importantly selfrespect leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboysbr br its the seriousness of course that kills it thats not to say that weighty subjects cant be treated in comedy  the miracle of morgans creek dr strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that indeed one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy  it allows for a clearereyed viewbr br the problem with carltonbrowne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny in the three films mentioned above much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation not the extreme situation itself here the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled  peter sellers terrythomas raymond huntley and john le mesurier  are criminally wastedbr br terrythomas sublime so often shows that he couldnt handle lead parts and that he needed to play sneering arrogant bounders not brainless toffs the music is made to carry much of the comedy but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen to be fair unlike the majority of british comedies of the period which were stagy and underproduced the boultings often try to make their points through film itself by montage and composition only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs and thats by essaying a character he could have played in his sleepbr br none of the boultings farces have dated well  theyre never thought through enough although carltonbrowne revels in the decline of the empire it also seems to be antidemocratic and militaristic im sure this wasnt intended but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form
