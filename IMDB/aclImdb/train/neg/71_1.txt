this movie was so unrelentingly bad i could hardly believe i was watching it the directing editing production and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who dont know all that much about movies there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense big emotional moments and climaxes like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts and character relationships like one hinted at at the very beginning come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film the characters are sadly underdeveloped making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them the acting surprisingly is not entirely bad but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances the film plays like a particularly bad tv westernepic and sadly diminishes the fascinating true story that it attempts to tell i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter thats all very well but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesnt make the movie good no one is saying that the subject matter isnt good just the quality of the movie itself pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans but that doesnt mean im going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad a failure all around though heath and orlando are lovely to look at
