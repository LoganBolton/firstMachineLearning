i really wanted to like this movie  the location shots were mostly filmed in pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography but even for a filmed cartoon it was a really badlymade movie the continuity and pacing were both simply awful the best bits in the movie are under the ending credits so its almost worth sticking it out to the end though oddly it does pick up a little over the last half hour or sobr br when the best performance in a movie is by andy dick you know theres got to be a problem
