i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made it had much the charm of get smart while it admittedly had its faults it was rather enjoyablebr br naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version that was before i saw it afterwords i wished it had never been madebr br besides being miscast all around who on earth though broderick was even close to the role it just didnt make the gradebr br the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie seeing a liveaction version of the gadgets in action what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interestingbr br the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude it was fun the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a cartoon on film it might have been enjoyablebr br as it exists it doesnt deserve to be considered part of the gadget legacy
