you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film i mention this so youll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith for some being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faithand that is not my intention so my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were well after seeing the film i doubt if i have learned much at all since i have been a history teacher i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so goshdarn nicetoo nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal plus you learn practically nothing about the churchs beliefs other than they are nice people work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film instead the people are almost cartoonlike in their simplistic portrayals joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic the nonmormons were all devils and brian donlevy playing exactly the same sort of role edward g robinson later played in the ten commandments is the troublemaker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy its all so very simpletoo simple almost like an indoctrination film or infomercialbr br brigham young especially was a very complex manwith many good points an excellent organizer and visionary as well as bad dont even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly its also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsleyonly the facts that led to his being almost superhuman were emphasized heck now that i think about that this is the trouble with most religious filmsthey often come off as onedimensional trite and bland lets have a full and more complete film of these menone that will stick to facts and not emotional appealsbr br now if you can ignore the fact that you wont learn very much about the faith or its second leader the film is enjoyable enough its obvious someone at 20th centuryfox really cared about the film as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors tyrone power up and coming actors linda darnell jane darwell and vincent price and wonderful character actors dean jagger john carradine and brian donlevy the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss it just didnt have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell plus there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith it was three years later no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups talk of gold in californiaeven though it was 1847 and gold wouldnt be discovered until 1948 as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smiths many wives just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom sceneand no one seemed to careeven though it was a very hostile audience dont you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with itbr br one final comment do not i repeat do not watch this film when its shown on american movie classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions what i mean is this the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of popups some advertising a show that features the sexiest cast talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film by doing this they not only insult the faith but marginalize their marketafter all who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young is this a movie in this form that you can show to your kids or recommend to others
