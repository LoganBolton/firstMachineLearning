while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic i have to admit that i dont hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that i havent seen many of the exorcist ripoffs and if exorcismo is anything to go by ill have to say thats a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it in fairness to the other exorcist ripoffs this is often considered one of the worst and so maybe it wasnt the best place for me to start its not hard to guess what the plot will be basically its the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism like many spanish horror films this one stars paul naschy who is pretty much the best thing about the film exorcismo was directed by juan bosch who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo the killer wore gloves i havent seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two i believe that originality wasnt one of his strong points theres not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isnt worth waiting for i certainly dont recommend it
