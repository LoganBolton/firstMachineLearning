this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns it seems that if you dont see names like robert duval kevin kostner or tom selleck attached to the cover it isnt worth messing with for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892 yet the revolvers used were 1860s models even the shooting was bad  in one scene the marshal fanned his sixshooter about nine times and couldnt hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting
