i just got through watching this dvd at home we love westerns so my husband rented it he started apologizing to me half way through the saddles costumes accentseverything was off the part that made me so mad is where the guy didnt shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guys soul his only excuse was he only had 2 arrows left we watched it all the way through and as someone else saidtoo many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked i mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found whats the point of that and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie however if you want a real western you will hate this movie
