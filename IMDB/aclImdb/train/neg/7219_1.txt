i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood the acting and story is simply pathetic  the direction is awful i dont see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap i bet the movie was made in less than a day i dont know what category it falls into please avoid this movie at all costs just do anything even bang your head against walls but dont go for this movie
