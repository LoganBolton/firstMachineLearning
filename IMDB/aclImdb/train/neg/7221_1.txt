cause its crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say why horrible camera workcount the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and cant the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible id bet 10 they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the cameramen were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more entertainmentstare at a wall
