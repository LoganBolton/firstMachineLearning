my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes roughly after the tv report scene which i couldnt handle it went approximately like thisbr br reporter 1 hmm theres a pyramid in our skies reporter 2 i think its aliens awkward silence reporter 1 in other newsbr br a few days later i watched it to the end and it wasnt as horrible as ive imagined but there are serious problems with this about half of the plot can be easily discarded and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or somethingbr br what use are the detective the eugenics people and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus more amusing was the monopoly scene were all powerful gods who have lived for aeons and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly monopoly monopoly even erich von dainiken looks coherent compared to thatbr br the other half is terribly lacking what did our protagonist do to get himself cryofrozen why was there no big event when he was released at the end he had those pesky followers remember what happened to normal humans whats the deal with the masked guy how did the bluehaired girl appear whats with her eyesight etcetera etceterabr br visually its ok more or less if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads
