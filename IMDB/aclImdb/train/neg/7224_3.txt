the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way im going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning im sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor mans blade runnerbr br the movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities it makes the movie leave a pointless and nonlasting impressionbr br also the weird look of the movie doesnt help much the movie is halve cgihalve real life but its not done halve as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and 300 they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless and odd choice also considering that the character animation isnt too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasnt cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isnt a positive thing to saybr br some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as im going to do this but its none of your concern why i want to do it than just dont say anything at all mr horus its irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you dont care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its scriptbr br the actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i cant say anything negative about thembr br the story and movie is far from original it ripoffs from a lot of classic and semiclassic mostly modern sciencefiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on mebr br a failed and uninteresting movie experimentbr br 310
