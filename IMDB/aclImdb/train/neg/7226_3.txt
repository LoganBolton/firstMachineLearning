i love the comics although i do have problems fully understanding the stories  the visual style is unique with all its dirt dust and decay so i thought i knew what i was up for surprisingly i understood the main plot  but some extremely poorly decisions where made for its visual style br br i mean  really bad looking cg human actorsin close ups why it did not work at all horus  and the other egyption gods  was successfully made in cg and very close to the comic version br br i think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie br br what a shame
