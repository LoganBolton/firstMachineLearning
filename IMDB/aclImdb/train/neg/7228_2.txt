the goodbr br effective color scheme good costumes top notch set production well detailed cgi buildings and vehiclesbr br the badbr br horrible mixture of actors with all cgi actors mixes fifth element with final fantasy the cgi actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago flawed logic a giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it no one really even questions it and there is no explanation as to why the god horus was even cast out nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate jillbr br the uglybr br awful script so many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized the dialog was almost laughable at some points random characters and events that are not needed dull characters jill is supposed to be this mystery but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer there is nothing to her she is uninteresting and boring to watch she has no substance no texture her character has no redeeming qualities in fact there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose any goals besides the obvious one of horus any motivation they are weak and illconceived there are no stakes  the key to screen writing horus will not become immortal but big deal he is a bad guy one cannot even decipher whether horus or jill is the main character that is the problem devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character never brings one to fruition they are cardboard cutouts who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces first time director pacing slow slow slow i am still watching the movie as i write this i cannot pay attention because it is boring everything is flat even the action is not interesting because it is shortlived and sometimes unnecessarybr br overallbr br not worth a watch threadbare story subpar character development corny cgi does not save the nice set production
