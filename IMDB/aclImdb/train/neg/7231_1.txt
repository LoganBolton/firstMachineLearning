i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing last days and some charlie chaplin films based on the quality of the other features i decided to give immortel a chance i nearly walked out of this movie and i like sciencefiction the story is set in a futuristic new york city filled with blade runnerstyle sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloningsynthetic humans unfortunately the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hourandfortyfiveminute movie three groups exist in this world humans artificial humans and egyptian gods the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city the humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation the egyptian gods have a floating pyramid modeled on the great pyramid of khufu and complete with a deteriorated exterior leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid wouldnt a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why its there i wont bore you with the socalled plot but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many grossout scenes the film as i said looks to have been influenced by blade runner and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix at the end of the film credits were listed thankyous to the united kingdom france and italy the film is french but uses british actors who dont speak french hence it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed this is a distraction and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting it doesnt help that the animations are poorno better than a video game skip this one
