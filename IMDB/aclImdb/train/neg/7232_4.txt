i thoroughly enjoyed bilals graphic novel when it came out and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film and even more so when i found that bilal had directed it himself the film however was a major letdown the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks and the story is poorly told bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel and he doesnt do a very good job at it eitherbr br the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendshiphate relationship between nikopol and horus they were both out of their right time and place forced together by circumstance most of all they were funny and likable not so here nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever and horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid even though the film is french horus doesnt have to bebr br we have all seen films we enjoyed but wouldnt recommend to everyone for some reason or other i wouldnt recommend immortel to anyone except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources bilals a master storyteller but obviously not a master of every visual medium
