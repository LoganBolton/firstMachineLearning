lets seeim trying to practice finding the positive in everything so what kind thing can i say about the pallbearerbr br i know the performances were  no that wont work as they succeeded in draining all personality from gwyneth paltrow usually so vibrant and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara hersheybr br oh  how bout the story  nope that isnt gonna fly either as it was dozeinducing what was the genre anyway it wasnt funny that rules out comedy it wasnt interesting enough to be dramatic was that a romance between schwimmer and paltrow i have to ask as i cant be sure  lets just call it losers in like im sure those behind this film started with a vision i mean they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits but i need help finding itbr br even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story i couldnt in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy fluffy stupid hair speaking of hair  are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by hersheybr br what am i doing i already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie  i cannot devote any more time to this loser
