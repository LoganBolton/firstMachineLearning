life is really too short for movies like this i knew it couldnt be good when i realized what id already suspected  that david schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in friendsbr br lets face it either the guy cant play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts i have a feeling that its a mixture of bothbr br and i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow barbara hershey toni collette and carol kane
