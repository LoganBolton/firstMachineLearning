the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up disliking most of the characters and you dont particularly like any of thembr br even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really dont care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers  and thats hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste
