i just didnt get this moviewas it a musical nobut there were choreographed songs and dancing in itbr br was it a serious dramano the acting was not good enough for thatbr br is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actordefinently notbr br i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worsebr br see for yourself but in fairness i hated it
