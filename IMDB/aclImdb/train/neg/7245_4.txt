im not to keen on the pallbearer its not too bad but just very slow at the times as the movie goes on it gets a little more interesting but nothing brilliant i really like david schwimmer and i think hes good here im not a massive gwyneth paltrow fan but i dont mind her sometimes and shes okay here the pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it
