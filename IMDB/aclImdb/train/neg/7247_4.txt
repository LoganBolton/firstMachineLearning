in a nutshell this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more it wants to be harold and maude annie hall the graduate it wants to be deep and human it has interesting camera shots lighting music editing all of which give it the feel of an important movie the dialog is smart  at times there are some laugh out loud momentsbr br but heres what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic latenightcable inflight timekiller br br 1 david schwimmer  how many times can joe sadsack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying maybe some drool would have helpedbr br 2 gwenneth paltrow  shes really flat here and not just in the chest her role is supposed to be this lively nice caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations is very confused as a result and that is why a sadsack loser like schwimmer has any chance with her but gwenneth plays her very dull combine this with puppydog droolface above and you have very little chemistry to care aboutbr br i kept picturing someone else in this role  kate hudson for example br br 3 the script and the plot  the stuff that happens just basically doesnt ring true all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said oops time to wrap it up got a train to catch so they pulled out the hollywood formula book checked off all the boxes and went home
