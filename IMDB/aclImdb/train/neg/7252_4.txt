the decoy is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers but it doesnt have all the usual flaws that sink most such films it has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men and the background music isnt overdone this is a dvd new release so people will be looking here to see if its worthwhile i dont know where all the 10s come from as theres no way this film is that good  even if youre the filmmakers mother br br the last film we saw at a theater was warners trashing of j k rawlings muchloved and excellent book order of the phoenix in comparing the decoy with phoenix consider that phoenix as made by warners had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wallofsound overbearing musical score was just a mess i rated phoenix a 1 because the scale doesnt go any lower the decoy is 4 times better  in all regardsbr br if you have the opportunity give the decoy a chance remember this isnt decoy 3  the shootout or any such nonsense its original if your expectations arent overblown by the foolish 10 scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms
