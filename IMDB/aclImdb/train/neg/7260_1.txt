a town called hell aka a town called bastard a britishspanish coproduction was made on the heels of clint eastwoods success in the italian made man with no name trilogy the template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable american actors whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices this film is no exception except for the fact that they used some british actors as wellbr br its difficult to summarize the plot but here goes the story opens with rebels or whatever led by robert shaw and marin landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside including the priest fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the shaw character is masquerading as a priest the mayor of the town telly savalas is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gunbr br throw into the mix a grieving widow alvira stella stevens who is searching for her husbands killer add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for god knows why after the mayor is murdered by his henchman la bomba al lettieri the town is invaded by a federale colonel landau in search of a rebel leader im sorry but the name escapes me the colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leaderbr br even though they opened the film side by side its difficult to tell from the dialog that the landau and shaw characters know each other a blind man fernando rey claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face he does so andbr br im sure the principals regretted making this film its just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded 1 rating shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy even landau cant salvage this film the beautiful ms stevens is totally wasted here too having just made peckinpahs the ballad of cable hogue the previous year i found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie savalas made several of these pictures pancho villa and horror express come to mind during he prekojak periodmichael craig is also in it somewhere as a character called pacobr br fernando rey appeared in many of these westerns although he would emerge to play the villain in the two french connection films al lettieri would also emerge with a role in the godfather 1972 and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975br br in all fairness the version i watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on imdb however i cant see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much differencebr br avoid this one
