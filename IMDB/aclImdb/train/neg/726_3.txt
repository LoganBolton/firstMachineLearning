i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators to me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main characters internal turmoil does not work at all in vonneguts book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hills adaptation for the screen it does credibility is often overstretched too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots br br a boy called campbell jr grows up in upstate new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it the boy leafs through the book his dad doesnt like his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin bang it is 1938 the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesnt like change dont ask mebr br possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of onebr br on the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fastbr br so now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc must have scrambled the messages terribly anyway the nazis lose the wife dies touring in the crimean for german troops  i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not go is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug how come is dragged to a sightseeing tour in auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new yorkbr br and this is where the story really starts br br bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is 1961 campbell jr lives in new york tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife nobody really cares  or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists Â„discover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmanns he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriters ribbons without getting sooty the least bitbr br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a winwin situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the storybr br one might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance
