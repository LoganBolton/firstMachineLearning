this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic lenght but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs the characters are unidimensional and have no other development in the story theres actually no story either than looking for each other and kissing its a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieving true emotional resonance on top of that it pretends to be an art film by using the worst naive clich√©s of the cinematic snobbery but anyway if someone can identify with its heavy banality i guess thats fine
