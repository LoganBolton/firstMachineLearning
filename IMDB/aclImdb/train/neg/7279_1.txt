i just saw this movie on a local tv station tv8s big chuck and little john in cleveland ohio i had never heard of this movie and decided to watch itbr br i know of no thesaurus that can even come close to aiding me in describing how bad this movie really is the script is awful the acting well other than one of two exceptions is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effortbr br it looks like a bunch of little ideas leftover from various writing sessions that where thrown into a blender its not just funny the parody aspect is strained at best some references where almost out of date even for the time of its release no wonder i had never heard of it its really bad worse than anything saturday night live mad tv or even in living color put out in their worst daysbr br if you see it on tv it is a great example of how not to make a movie whatever you do dont waste a centbr br adam
