i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons ive ever seen i did not laugh once throughout this short and its a bugs bunny cartoon for christs sake bugs bunny cartoons are always funny not boring alas this short turns out to be good night elmer another incredibly boring jones short with the addition of bugs bunnybr br the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff this cartoon on the other hand is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon theres too much dialogue the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue at one point elmer finishes eating dinner and comments that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb possibly the most redundant dialogue ive ever heard in a cartoon characters reading text out loud in the laterera woody woodpecker cartoons doesnt count in my book even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like thisbr br elmers pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me but if youve sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career you might enjoy it
