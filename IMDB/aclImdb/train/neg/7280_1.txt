ill keep the review of this program as short as possible skip it low budget not funny lousy script acting not quite as bad as the writing but still bad thats all you need to know but i will continue for the sake of writing more than necessarybr br this is a film with three segments each one parodying some other type of movie a much funnier film with this same exact idea is movie movie with george c scott very obscure but worth searching out mm parodied films of the 1930s and did it with elegance precision and dry witbr br this movie did not it parodies three types of films supposedly from the late 70s early 80s era only it is parodying films ive almost never heard of the first is i guess a parody of kramer vs kramer in a way peter reigert does his best with a dirt poor script the second is a parody of i dont know whata danielle steele novel i mean you might see a story like this on lifetime tv but in a movie theater i mean i remember the 70s i was there this is a soapopera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power these type of things usually parody themselves so i dont see how this was even necessarybr br we are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment the municipalians which parodies cop movies i noted elements of the new centurians and some dirty harry both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created yeah nice and current robby benson plays the idealistic young rookie overthetop wimpy while richard widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car oh stop my sides hes actually drinking booze in the police car how irreverent note that this was the first film after animal house to have the national lampoon name attached wow to go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking i could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cuttingedge and original voices in american humor that would be national lampoon the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so to sell out and begin a long slow slide into a world of crap where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on lowbudget comedy films for a fee yet another reason why capitalism and cocaine sucks so badbr br anyway this movie is a serious time suck dont waste your 90 minutes i want mine back on the positive side fred willards in it
