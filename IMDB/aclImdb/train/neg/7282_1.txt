national lampoon was once a funny magazine whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy cokehead days of the seventies when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes depends very much on your date of birth but everyone agrees that by the early eighties middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadnt and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spinoff records shot further holes in the hull outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence theres absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug if you make it through the baffling opening segment growing myself hoping things will get better tough luck  they dont whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess if theres ever a global shortage of guitar picks the negatives of this rambling incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose
