what a long drawnout pointless movie im sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesnt make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient schindlers list but this one was such a letdown it didnt seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all dont bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead
