from the opening dialog and scenes i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck didnt want to look but couldnt turn away if it werent for the meer eye candy of this film i would have given one star the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a lowbudget disaster money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to reboundbr br if you were stuck out in the woods your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease other friends dying around you stranded in a strange place what would you dobr br a run away from everyone and try your luck on your own b have sex with your friends girlfriend c take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs d bash in the head your childhood best friend and lifelong crush with a shovel e all of the abovebr br according to eli roth none of these answers are that far fetched in fact all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store stay away stay far away
