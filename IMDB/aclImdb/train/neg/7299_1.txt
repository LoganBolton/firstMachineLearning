sure ive seen bad movies in my life but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater i wanted my money back i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket of course i didnt receive a refund or even a reply but its the point that matters on a scale of 110 i give this movie a 42 why did the jeep chevy blazer stop running from being hit with a bat why did they hit the jeepchevy blazer with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bums skull the plot was thin the movie filled with obvious clich√©s and certain parts of it just didnt make any sense
