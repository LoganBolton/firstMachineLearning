this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods one of the friends catches a horrifying flesheating virus suddenly the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselvesbr br cabin fever is a horrible film for one it tries to be many genres at once is it supposed to be a homage a slasher a black comedy or a scary movie with unintentional comedy nobody can tell theres a serious scene at first and a second alter it turns funny when the film tries to be funny the humor is quite bland excluding the ending i liked the ending a lotbr br but apart from the ending i was pretty disappointed and disgusted the violence is cringeworthy more looking away from the screen than being scared the tone changes within each scene sometimes funny sometimes scary and sometimes quite random in fact you see a girl doing karate in slomotion what are we supposed to get from that this same girl would bite one of the characters was that supposed to be funny i dont knowbr br some of the performances were decent and many were quite amateurish i didnt care for most of the characters i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly as a horror film i didnt know what it was trying to be i didnt find it funny tense nor scary by the end youre left indifferent thinking what have i just been through unfortunately youll never know the answer to that question
