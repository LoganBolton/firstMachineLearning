i had heard some bad things about cabin fever almost as much as i heard the cultish hype as it turns out the first film from the new impresario eli roth its just a soso effort with the iq points dropping as the film progresses there are worse movies out there and surely more gory ones while im not sure how the hypemeter got so high on the bloodcount for hostel there is a good amount for genre fans here the premise isnt necessarily bad either though kids go to a cabin for a week of partying only to come across a very sick man covered in blood whom in a panic they set on fire he winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir and soon the characters all succumb to the flesheating virus one way or another the characters either the lead college kids including rider strong as the hero and james dibello as the goofy sidebar or the supporting village folks are archetypal to the point of inertia if not painfully so br br as they meet their fates the townspeople get pretty weird and it just seems to be nonsensibly thrown together without the many laughs pancakes kid comes out of nowhere and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself but in the context of the rest of the movie it just doesnt work theres also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others and the family that goes after dibello following an incident has some possibilities that arent realized but all the while roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around which isnt all for not either now unlike lesser troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s to which im sure roth is a diehard fan he doesnt make it unwatchable its also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from br br but unlike those films too he also doesnt really have a fine idea of what makes for great campyhorror times his film tries for that of course and only once or twice does he make it a goofy bloody time i did like the random bunny strong sees while on the gurney its not even very poorly shot a lot of the time albeit with its own contrived stylechoices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowlingalley worker it simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made shave your legs with a deadly virus uhhuh and it aims for fairly typical ground if thats your cup of tea more power to you but at the end i found it to be actually unexceptional genre territory that doesnt offend audience sensibilities ala saw but doesnt swing for the fence either as a clever bmovie roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of whatthehell as the santa claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people it could work if he followed up on it with something better or if he dropped it altogether same could be said for a lot of the movie c
