truly one of the most dire films ive ever sat through ive never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to filmmaking and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest there were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense eg when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases when would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed also the characterisation  as weve almost come to expect in such films  was awful eg the way the blonde guy  i dont remember his frickin name and dont give a toss anyway  completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her and i ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends the production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about
