liongate has yet to prove itself every single movie from lionsgate has been abysmal ive tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep slapping me over and over again and cabin fever is definitely no exceptionbr br i couldnt even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and badbr br heres the plot guy cuts up dead dog for some reason gets infected by random virus transfers it to kids at a camp kids start to get infected and die town finds out about it and rather than help them kills them then the water is infected and everyone dies the endbr br seriously thats the whole moviebr br all the characters are completely retarded you dont care for any of them and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie we did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bullst because this film will make you do thatbr br and im still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish and again why did this dog attack the girl why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him that was part of the two of theirs plan wow best plan ever i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release i could barely stomach the dvd let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half it wasnt scary or funny or cool or anything its just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using toi dont know plant a tree or something its more productive than this piece of garbage the acting special effects and script are a joke dont ever pick this upbr br cabin fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene out of 10
