ive rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on dvd without reading any reviews about it so after 15 minutes of watching ive noticed that something is wrong with this movie its terrible i mean in the trailers it looked scary and seriousbr br i think that eli roth mr director thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid the movie would be funnyso stupid its funny wrong he should watch and learn from better horrorcomedies such asfright night the lost boys and the return of the living dead those are funnybr br cabin fever is the reason why i registered to wwwimdbcom so i can release my thoughts of discontent about itbr br ive decided to watch the movie a second time aaargh and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is resident evil horror or dude wheres my car comedy i can watch over and over again and still enjoy but thisbr br how bad can a script and a director be this bad here are the awful scenes in chronological orderbr br in the early scenes we see henry who doesnt realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and deadglazed stare is deadbr br the movie doesnt explain anything about the blonde longhaired kid who like to bite peoplebr br and my answer to marcys unanswered question whats wrong with the woods is nothing the script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspensebr br then the smartest of the 5pack bert almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire he meets nowinfected henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the fword bert starts to freak out because henry looks awfully ill bertdont make me shoot you he forgets to add with my bb gunbr br bert heads back to the cabin but how about that he meets marcy and jeff who were having sex but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire bert had started earlier a moment of clarity for a change bert doesnt mention a word about henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his bb gunbr br later as the five estupidos sit around their campfire another weirdo shows up with his dog maybe thats what the warning about the woods is all about its filled with weirdosand their dogs they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis their brains are completely intoxicated no wonder why they are all so dumb this is the last time well see this forgettable characteralivebr br henry shows up at their cabin note he was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin looking worse almost like a zombie covered in goo he says he needs a doctor but the young einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker he gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard seats and windows the fantastic five come out running armed with a bb gun a knife a baseball bat huh ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods a poker and a insecticide spraycan ready to combat the single unarmed and terribly sick man clever script bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth what else am i supposed to do bert yells in his defense jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the trucks windows instead henry walks up to the dumb girls who say hes coming towards us thanks for the info dumb broads i can see that but i dont think he wants to do you any harm marcy sprays in his eyes making henry yelp and our hero paul touches henrys arm with a burning log from the campfire which they recklessly left burning while they were inside the cabin where has all that wisdom gone i guess the cannabis had started to take its toll henry turns into the human torch and runs away screamingbr br the following day bert and jeff head out for a mechanic and marcy decides to go for help all by herself in the woods as paul stays behind with karendoesnt that sound idiotic marcy could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already going for helpbr br i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river how did she get a canoe does she even know where shes going anyway she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and like in most horror movies walks inside the cabin sayinghello is anyone there bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her and me at first and along comes jeff as well how did they get here did they swim across the river do you see how brainless the script isbr br deputy winston meets paul at the cabin he somehow doesnt notice the blood on their truck this happens around 35 minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out before i take my own eyes outnow thats funnybr br if you liked this movie do yourself a favor and watch fright night the lost boys or the return of the living dead then youll see they are more entertaining than thisthing even the toxic avenger part 2 which is also a lousy film is way more funnier than cabin fever
