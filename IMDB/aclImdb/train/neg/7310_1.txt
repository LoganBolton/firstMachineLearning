spoilers belowbr br cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the yearthat ive seen that is this movie is straight garbage there is so much wrong with the film you cant help but be amazed at how bad it really is this movie had so much potential to be good but ultimately made nothing of it the characters were as dumb as one can be for the entire movie youre just asking yourself why would you do that or whats your point in doing thisthis is how illogical and stupid the characters are we get no background into them so naturally you really dont give a rats as about their fateyou could only laugh at their stupidity br br  the slut marcy for instance was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul rider strong there was no point in thatits almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila ugh br br  would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin without looking at it firstbr br  why didnt bert just shoot the sick guy from the start movie wouldve been over that waybesides they ended up killing him anywaybr br  why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin even if they had to walk no ill just wait until 2 of my friends are infected one a blink away from death to finally opt to walk outta therebr br  what was exactly the reasoning behind pauls attempt to fish out the body of the hermit only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus pure stupiditybr br i swear common sense was not a friend much less an aquaintance to these idiots i dont think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie in the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for and he replied that its for the niggers in the end of the film 3 young blacks dressed in baggy clothes one of them in a durag no less go into the storecome to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting then he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if theyre his homeboysbr br okay what the hell was the point of that how tasteless can one be what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie i as a black man was of course offended by the initial nigger comment it was a tasteless pointless remark my question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the black kids was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier to smooth things over with black viewers by making a joke out of it well i for one did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit the whole movie was a jokea pathetic attempt at filmmaking that shouldnt be given the time of day peter jackson really thought this film was that good what film was he looking at br br zero  out of  starsif i could give it a lower rating i would please fellow imdbers dont waste 1 12 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a movie this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen
