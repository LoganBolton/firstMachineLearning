i wasted 575 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few thingsbr br what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in halfbr br what was the point of dragging karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been saferbr br why would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the hog lady to take him to the hospitalbr br why didnt any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazybr br even if paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for peeping on his wife paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help the girl he loves is deterioratingbr br what was the point of the boxbr br why did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldnt he have just gone back homebr br if the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw paul halfway into the river it wasnt even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminatedbr br who makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it why couldnt the two kids have just use the tap water it was contaminated too so the stupid ending would still work
