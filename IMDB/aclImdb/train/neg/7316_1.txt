when i saw the previews for this movie i didnt expect much to begin with  around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and thats being generousbr br first of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the godawful thing to endbr br secondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlishlooking boy starts screaming pancakes at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves ive never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virusinfected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come frombr br i just simply couldnt believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains outbr br please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative
