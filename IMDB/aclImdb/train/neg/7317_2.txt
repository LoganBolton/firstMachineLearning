having read the other comments on this film i would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total brooksophile i am notbr br when looked at by a purely objective observer the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting it is quite difficult to watch the brooks character robert cole is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to himlet alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional selfabsorbed situation to the next and he should never do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context no man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like kathryn harroldunless of course he is albert brooks in an albert brookscontrolled productionbr br modern romance has its amusing momentsbut they are fragmentary and infrequent more often than not i felt as if i were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already it confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one personsomeone who lacks the selfdiscipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happeningbr br as most people probably know james l brooks who played the director in this film is in fact what he portrayed six years later he cast albert brooks in the very successful broadcast news james showed us how albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance albert allowed us to see james generally not cast as an actor do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective mannerbr br fans of modern romance will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it to you i saythere is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment
