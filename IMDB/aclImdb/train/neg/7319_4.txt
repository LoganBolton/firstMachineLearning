when you get to the scenes that involve albert brooks without his shirt try not to gag on a fur ballbr br i like albert brooks ive seen most if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love there are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as modern romance although 1979s chilly scenes of winter comes very close they both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attractedobsessed to their respective womenbr br whereas chilly scenes of winter borders on the subject stalking this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship and out of the relationship and back in it againbr br and because its a movie that was released in 1981 it is of its time in terms of styles and such thats the main reason i like this movie my basic rule when it comes to movies is if it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance you know time capsule stuffbr br which leads me to the horrific scenes of albert brooks sans shirtbr br the man is hair very hair like hes wearing a black curly fur sweaterhairy and whats worse is he almost looks burn victimhairy its not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on back in the early 80s hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking but in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting sorry albert i wish at some point someone said hey lets try this scene but with you wearing a simple tshirt i mean you might scare people its just really bad and i feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with albert brooks naked body on top of hers she was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after thatbr br anyway its an ok movie it could have been better if i hadnt see albert brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie
