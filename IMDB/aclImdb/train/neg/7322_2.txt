ill give credit where credit is due and say that linda fiorentino gives a good performance as a harddrinking actress who does what she wants shes brash sassy hardedged and very sexy she is much better than this film deservesbr br but that is it this dull suspense film is a fragmented mess attempting at once to be a stalker thriller a murder thriller a tale of loyalty and betrayal and a steamy erotic thriller the film my friends isnt thrilling in the slightestbr br for instance who thought of casting c thomas howell as a desirable leading man he is not ugly but for crying out loud it looks as though fiorentinos toughcookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man rolebr br the script is by far the worst aspect of the film there is no tension as fiorentinos character gets eerie phone calls there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film there is no sense of liberation as fiorentino gets wimpy howell to lose his inhibitionsbr br look for interesting but poorlydone cameos by adam ant and issac hayes and one really really good sex scene between howell and fiorentino besides that my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else
