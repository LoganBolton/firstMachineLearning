wellin contrast to other comments previously written i have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like jason donavon which reminded me of my youth i have no idea how it won any awards and although im sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90s foreign soap operas the plot was nonexistent the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an alevel performance it was unfortunately long and the subplots were incredibly unrealisticfor exampleif your best friend slept with your exboyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends it was all fantasy thats all oh yeah and the weird 90s housesoft core indie was mind numbing
