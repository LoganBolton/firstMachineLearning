heavyhanded moralism writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves predictable plodding plot points say that five times fast a childs imitation of britney spears this film has all the earmarks of a lifetime special rejectbr br i honestly believe that jesus nebot and julia montejo set out to create a thoughtprovoking emotional film on a tough subject exploring the idea that things are not always black and white that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being and that there can be extenuating circumstances especially when one puts the wellbeing of a child first however their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along the decent production values and interesting use of documentarystyle camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flatbr br logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension soid first tries to blackmail pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because shes not helping them out of altruism well duh and for a man on the run pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum cristinas wellbeing is so important to him that hes fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her but hes willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesnt want to go to mexico right talk above overpermissive parenting third when pablos employer charlie gives the phone to detective bright she is remarkably unprofessional especially given her seniority  did she really think she was persuasive oh yeah i would have turned myself in cch pounders detective wims could wipe the floor with herbr br to be fair id like to list the things i liked um i liked the midget and i liked the fact that the midget was named sexy theres crossdressing always a plus juvenile crossdressing no less harry is infinitely cuter than cristina but my favorite moment in the film has to be when cristina kicks detective notsobright i also find it interesting that in a heavily minority cast which i much appreciate by the way the black character is the racist one too bad its just thrown out there and not further exploredbr br theres a distinctive unconventional score but its nonetheless generally contextunspecific not enhancing mood or tension in any scene except the pathetic anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish as though they think his acting doesnt show it enough just in case you werent sure hes upset and we have the musical cues to prove itbr br stilted clich√©d dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext everything has to be spelled out in dialogue even when the body language had been up til then conveying it just fine for example every impassioned speech pablo makes and mrs knights lament that her child wont be crawling into bed with them in the morningbr br papi tell me about mama again  what shameless blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife shes always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen the kindest he had ever met why cant we see a man cry over a woman like shakespeares  she may be fat ugly obnoxious but his love for her is deep as oceans now theres a story which would move mebr br the police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the outofplace feeling of a french farce most boring foot chases ever  bright and lightning are so outofshape and easilyfooled he certainly isnt quick as lightning and she well i dont feel the need to spell things out some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child to quote margaret cho thats so sad would we ever see this on cops br br hackneyed and overthetop deus ex machina as an employer would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your deskbr br plus several scenes including the above threaten to devolve into porn well ill do this favor for you as long as you do something for me i can almost hear the bowmchickabowmbowmbr br when the parents view the footage shot of pablos remorse the grieving moms freakout is the most real the movie feels unfortunately this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic a more ambivalent look would be more convincing herebr br im in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot holding up a convenience store without a mask visiting the dead girls grave and why doesnt the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off you seem awfully familiarbr br what is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary somewhat gratuitous scene with soid and the artificiallyenhanced bartender character development tch too little too latebr br speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere detective lightnings saying skeptical detective bright must be a scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult and i dont think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbobr br at the end when bright holds pablo as he dies  wait why does she care now her character is as inconsistent as soids what she has to shoot him just because she said stop or ill shoot shes cared somuch about her integrity thus far he was unarmed there was no need for lethal force whats wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize himbr br finally cristinas childlike acceptance of her mothers death giving dr knight peace over his daughters death  so forced and the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming cristinas new family it angers me that she could be a replacement for their little girl its also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter im not saying there arent generous loving people who would do that im just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that they would do thatbr br i find it offensive that another imdb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes i am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that dont wax sentimental in a manufactured mannerbr br cowriter codirector costar nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production too many cooks may spoil the broth but one cook alone just might end up making an afterschool specialbr br in conclusion this films title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret helplessness and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again
