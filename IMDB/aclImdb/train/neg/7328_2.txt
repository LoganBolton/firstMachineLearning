i see a lot of people liked this movie to me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class from the time lindsey price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable i kept on watching to see if it was going anywherebr br first we have the widowed young father cliché 1 moviestv always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children starting from from my 3 sons to 2 12 dads these movies are usually dramas and comedies are tv showsbr br cliché  2 when a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie and will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead br br cliché 3 if the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of latino origin and they must be illegal apparently there are no legal latinos and illegal europeans unless if there is a ira element involvedbr br cliché 4 the said latino must be highly educated in his native country in this case he was a profesor who made 200 per month and the said highly educated latino must now act like he hasnt brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take overbr br cliché 5 the crime the person committed really wasnt a crime but a accident but because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kickbr br cliché 6 one never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime  but some poor little cute kid this is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parentsbr br cliché 7 name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police force sev7n and copy cat and law and order come to mind right away and the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of goldbr br cliché 8 lets go and round up some unemployed soap stars now i like lindsey price but susan haskell imo can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on one life to live as marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth it use to get me sea sick she might be anchored on land better now but she still cannot actbr br the movie might have been more insightful if it wasnt filled with clichés i dont think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good but this was just badbr br spoiler now i am not going to spoil the ending oh heck i will because i feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie it involves cliché 6 and 7 unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming the father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran who all of a sudden is very upset you would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake when she didnt now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him guess what happen to her times up she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father come on you all knew that was going to happen because she is a replacement child that is why she did not go and live with the lindey price character br br this movie was a insult as far as i was concerned because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the cliché ridden one the 2 stars are for 2 of the stars the little girl who i thought was very good and lindsey price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it my advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
