despite being a 2001 movie the direction is the kind of 90s arthouse style that was considered old and outofdate a few years ago the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch the script is decent enough and a few scenes did kind of captivate me like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night but the story line with the detective whos sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible the performance by the actor who plays selma blairs married boyfriend seriously bothered me i did sit through the whole thing though which is rare for the kind of random whatisthis movie you just find on tv and decide to watch
