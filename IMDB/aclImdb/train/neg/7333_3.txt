i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes but 20minutes in i was liberally applying the fastforward button far too many shots of stewart michael zelniker walking from room to room down hallways through doors and down the street and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short 2030 minutes and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director grieve and star zelniker they cowrote the screenplaybr br it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadnt heard said in many other films before or if the ending wasnt  disappointingly  the one i had predicted three minutes into the film atypical for an independentsmaller studio film at least its heart was in the right place  it wasnt your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense
