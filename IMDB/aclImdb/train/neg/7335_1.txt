this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen  several times on stage apart from the moviebr br a very nice idea for the set up  the american south can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round heros supposed misdemeanourbr br but the execution widdoes is a very mannered beatrice giving a particularly poor performance waterston a fine actor is not much better as benedictbr br the poorest performance is in the role of don john  it makes keanu reeves look good perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of dogberry and his men  but the acting makes you want to cringebr br successful setups include the scene where they fool benedict into believing beatrice loves him  were the acting competent it would be superb but the use of the river and the visual humour of benedict moving closer is well producedbr br overall i had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didnt keep my attentionbr br very disappointingbr br with respect to latter comments above i am nearly 40 ive been watching stage and screen productions of shakespeare for over 2 decades might i suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact i can assume though from your distaste regarding youth that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your tastebr br my personal favourite pairing was rylance and mcteer on the london stage unlike widdoes mcteer a skilled and charismatic performer can act
