this is a very bland and inert production of one of shakespeares most vibrant plays i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before by doing this though  by making every line clear and every intent obvious  they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature somehow it is actually boring  a very hard feat given such wonderful materialbr br the acting is forgettable at best  sam waterston as benedick and douglas watson as don pedro others however do not fare so well april shawnhams hero is a pouty breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces jerry mayers don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of snidely whiplash though snidley was much more enjoyablebr br f murray abraham you know the guy who killed mozart is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the creditsbr br given that the producer joseph papp is basically a theater god this production is not only disappointing but headscratching as wellbr br dont bother with this watch branaghs much ado instead  his version is overflowing with vitality and humor to say nothing of wonderful performances
