ive been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasnt good at all the play of the actors werent any betterbr br of course shahrukh khan was there yet he wasnt enough to make this movie credible and interestingbr br ive read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert madame bovary yet for me i didnt see it matching with the indian mentalitybr br in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just cant understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of 6810br br so its the kind of movie you should run away  ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story
