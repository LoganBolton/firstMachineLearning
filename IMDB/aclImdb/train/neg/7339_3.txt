maya is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues it doesnt have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only lengths and no climaxesthe only climax is shahrukh khan but although i am a huge fan of his i couldnt stand this movie even he cant make this movie exiting the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if youre an arthouse fan or like it slow you might maybe like it its not funny its not interesting its not catching my recommendation dont watch it
