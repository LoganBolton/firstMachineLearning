those of you who like me were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel it sort of follows a similar plot but it is impossible to connect to the original with the exception of the presence of morty the mannequin monster made of wood here is a brief overviewbr br twenty years after mike hawthorne gordon currie in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life mike is still suffering from the fear of that day in hopes of ridding his fear mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents home his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears and then present the fears to the mannequin morty according to an indian friend this process is supposed to magically take away ones fear what mike doesnt know is that morty is possessed with his fathers spirit and begins killing off the friendsor is it really mike himself doing the killings who caresbr br a have a few troubles with this film the first lies with morty i thought the original made morty look rather convincing this time it is painfully obvious morty is a man actor jon fedele in a fake looking suit this can especially be seen in early scenes where morty is still supposed to be inanimate but if you watch closely you can see him blinking another trouble is that most of the characters dont try hard enough some of them do namely betsy palmer of friday the 13th fame who was excellent in this film but most of them dont make the effort or werent given the chance finally there are the killings the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie when the second half of the movie arrives and the killings really start everything falls to pieces deaths are either uncreative unseen or foreseen glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout one character dies in the end and no one including the viewer even notices while more characterization was needed in the beginning half it wasnt too bad the second half was i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didnt know how to shoot the violent scenes so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian a silly ending doesnt help either thus unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin you should probably skip the fear 2 halloween night zanatos score 4 out of 10
