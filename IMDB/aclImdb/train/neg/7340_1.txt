impressed this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw i didnt like the novel but this movie made it worse very bad music even worse actors apart from srk of course though even he doesnt manage to save the movie and not much sense the director makes it all look very confusing god knows why maybe its because hes trying to make it all look very surrealistic and yet credible well he manages neitherbr br even if youve got a few hours to loose dont watch this movie please saying this for your own welfare keep searching you will find something else to watch
