this is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older married lover after she gets pregnant she avenges herself against him and his entire family through black magic  which disappointingly she doesnt do herself but has someone else do for her good production values for a thai horror flick but the bland script never generates suspense the director approaches the material entirely conventionally and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds at one point a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun bad writing  youre soaking in it br br some icky gore effects including a really tasteless latetermfetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in asia in the last 15 years
