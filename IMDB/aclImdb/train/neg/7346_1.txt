i feel like ive just watched a snuff filma beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldnt stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and im neither puritanical nor humorless i dont try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a sheltered life but i am ashamed of myself and im sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subjectmatter sewers the way my own tribe does it doesnt have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism
