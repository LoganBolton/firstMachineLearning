polyester was the very first john waters film i saw and i have to say that it was also the worst movie i had seen up to that pointbr br waters group of talent included several people who i am sure worked for food and were willing to say the lines waters wrote every thing about the movie is terrible acting camera editing and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite divine was purely absurdbr br that said i have to recommend this film because it is very funny and you wont believe the crap that happens to poor francine her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting womens feet at the grocery store her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town her husband is a cackling ahole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor francinebr br francines only friend is played by edith massey possibly the worst actress ever edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filmingbr br despite all of francines travails waters cooks up a fabulous hollywood ending and everyone who survives lives happily ever after
