despite pretty bad reviews i just had to give this film a go Â– it does after all star hk superbabe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of allaction catburglars surely thats worth checking out well as babefests go martial angels is hard to beat the eye candy is top quality shu qi looks as fantastic as always and of the rest of the girls rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particularbr br unfortunately if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits it is an absolute stinker the story is weak the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little elsebr br if shu qi is the only reason youre contemplating seeing this one you would be better off watching sex and zen 2 again
