watching it now its still as skanky and sexist as i remember comes from a time when girls were dolly birds and basically mens playthings its hard to take in that it is from the hammer studios and the fact its available on dvd when good films are not our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse trouble is you cant help feeling nostalgic for a clippie on a bus try to hold your stomach contents when you see olive in a fluffy blue saucy nightie or something similar like shirley bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972 warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus which ive been informed is not a routemaster but a bristolbr br look just dont bother watch something decent instead like porridge or dads armyor a fly crawling up a wall
