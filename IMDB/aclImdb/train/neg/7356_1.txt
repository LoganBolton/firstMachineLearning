got into this flick just as it was beginning on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu  otherwise id have missed it that probably would have been bestbr br i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas  both very good performers  and thought this might be worth a look it proved to be to some extent but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinatesbr br zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talents except for her jayne mansfield or loni andersonlike bosom unfortunately her acting prowess  at least here  makes mansfield and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparisonbr br the young nut cases white rat the owners cat the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home and a bunch of doophuss including the young nut case running around a bio hazard facility and the absurd conclusion i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism believability or being capable of evoking some empathysympathy  but this proved to be in vain
