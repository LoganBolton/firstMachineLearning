anyone whos watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table so when crazed lara moves into pattis home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers i didnt even blink when lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor patti and dares her to do anything about it i just nodded you see on planet lmn people dont behave the way they do for any particular reason they just do it to keep the action going only on planet lmn could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers poor patti  she just trusted too much and lara went off her medicine and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someones tummy and a body bag going out the front door the horrorbr br but take it from me this planet lmn product is a classic you need to watch it once just for the great laughs youll have on the improbability scale i give this film a 95100 make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices too youll understand later
