mr perlman gives a standout performance as usual sadly he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set piecesbr br larsen is in die hard mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles im sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his partbr br the lovely erika is very decorative even though fully clothed and shows some signs of getting acting at lastbr br sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other moviesbr br the shootouts are pitiful  worthy of the ateambr br not even worth seeing for perlman  avoid
