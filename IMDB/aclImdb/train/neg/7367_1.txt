i am truly beginning to believe that seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could becomethis particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to seemy first complaint was the cover of the dvd where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like craphe has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his facebr br the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too longthe whole film was leading up to the finale where seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancerthere was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of seagals voice even in the middle of a statementthe dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comicalbr br the fight scenes in the film were horriblehalf the time when seagal fought you could not even see what was going onthere would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or somethingit was reminiscent of the old kung fu series on televisionthey used way too much slow motion for the fight scenesbr br i believe this is seagals worst film to date and i am glad i did not purchase this film or i would have been very upset since i am a huge fan of seagal the aikidoistthe action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance
