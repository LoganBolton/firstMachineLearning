i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldnt be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him the editing is  well  just a grade above amateurish its nothing more than a b or cgrade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designerbr br like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in postproduction voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plots actually ok for a sg flickbr br ill never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgivenessbr br too bad  i miss kelly lebrockbr br jimbo
