i dont know what the rest of you guys watch steven seagal movies for but i watch them because as silly as they are theyre at least always good for a laugh why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness ofbr br attack force is by no means a great movie but i felt it was as worthy a steven seagal vehicle as many of his other movies in fact i didnt think it was one of his worst by a longshot it had most of the time a halfway coherent plot line and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting the ending really sucked but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements in the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but i actually thought that the acting characterization if i may use such a big word and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true steven seagal fan would expect seagal himself in particular was exactly the stonefaced nononsense mans man that weve come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever upstaging him this people is what a steven seagal movie does deal with it or even better laugh at itbr br 4 out of 10
