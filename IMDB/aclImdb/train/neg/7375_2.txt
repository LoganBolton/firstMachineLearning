this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal or as i should say steven sodull like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to redub his own lines leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped a few films before this was he has done this too but i dont think to this extent to be honest the film looks pretty good the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie of course all told this film is pretty badbr br it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself dont bother anything over a buck for this one is too much i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film whats taken me so long to realize this
