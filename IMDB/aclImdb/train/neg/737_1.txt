wowbr br i just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for 198 at walmart and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didnt have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a novice or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really isbr br example in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in 1990br br if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can download two trailers from their site and see how godawful it really is
