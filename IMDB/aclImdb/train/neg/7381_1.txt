okay first off seagals voice is dubbed over for like 50 of the film why because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions from the very beginning you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting but they make no sensebr br that said the story still sucked and doesnt make any sense at all when i got the the end i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didnt even make sensebr br avoid like the plague this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse
