star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning br br marshall lawson steven seagal is assigned to france on a reconaissance mission along with three new young striketeam recruits after disobeying a direct order from above however the night before theyre due to strike they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength with the french police dallying around with their own investigation he goes in search of those responsible himself only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a persons dna and gives them terrifying new strengthbr br bad cover bad title bad postproduction tampering and bad trailer pretty bad film but ive got to say i dont think attack force is quite his worst i know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here perhaps not steveday but i think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itselfbr br i must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as id been lead to believe the dubbing there was which made him sound like martin sheen with a groin problem was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as id thought the plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called harvester that went on also as another reviewer noted the film has a nice gothic look to it a new touch for a seagal filmbr br the absolute killer low point though was the complete and total lack of any exciting action with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any funbr br i have to be honest though i would rather watch this again than flight of fury today you die or out for a kill
