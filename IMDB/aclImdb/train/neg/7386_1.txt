i tried restarting the movie twice i put it in three machines to see what was wrong did steven seagals voice change did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesnt even resemble him or was the sound on the dvd destroyed after about 10 minutes you finally hear the actors real voice though throughout most of the film it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroombr br i would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to goodwill if i owned a copy i rented it but i will never do that again i will check this database before renting any more of his movies all of which were more or less good movies you usually knew what you were getting when you watched a steven seagal movie i guess that is no more
