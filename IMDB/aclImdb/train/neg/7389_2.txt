i buy or at least watch every seagall movie he came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories bad camera work and a walkthru persona he nearly lost me a few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie now hes forgotten again this film is seriously dark on any level you care to name there is a lot of slash  gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless its meant as a warning against the militarybr br seagall may have had a standin for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone elses voice was used most of the time sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody  then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner anyway this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused theres lots of gore if you like that king of thing it looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time im just glad they didnt suck the blood from their hapless victims i harken you back to my summary basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action filmdec 62006
