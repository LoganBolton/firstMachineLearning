how do you spell washed up fat italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication in this movie we see steven seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career in this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every daybr br he is fat slow and very old looking in this movie hardly a martial arts action hero more like a laughing stock clownbr br its time for steven seagal to retire this movie is about 2 hours of reasons whybr br plot fat italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response this pretense although pathetic and laughable gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic bookbr br did i mention this movie totally sucks and steven seagal is a complete joke yeah i did
