im a huge steven seagal fan hell i probably weigh as much as he does although i dont have the street cred to sport the frizzymulletponytail having stated my own bias and affection for americas favorite corpulent stage and screen hero it is with a heavy heart that i must declare this to be his worst movie ever im not sure he could make a movie any worse than thisbr br in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in postproduction its painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline that results in woeful voiceovers in which steves voice doesnt nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad gets even worse and by the end youll wish you had rewatched the da vinci code instead yes its that badbr br after this i dont know what to expect from steve my friends still laugh at me for listening to his cds is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty logs if you are tempted to watch this movie rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this
