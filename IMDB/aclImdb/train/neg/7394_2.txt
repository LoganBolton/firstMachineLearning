attack force has a horrendous title and can almost certainly be judged by its awful cover because the film is horrible a mishmash of plot lines a choppy mess and a horribly stagnated pace make the film hard to watch start to finish i managed this and im proud as a fan of seagals work mostly of his old days its painful to see him star in such tripe true seagals last half dozen movies or so have sucked a lot but some of them at least had some redeeming features attack force is a mess from conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes from an alien plot line to the current one about a highly addictive super drug about to be unleashed on the romanian the film has several settings none of which are romanian but all look like romania because they are in romania populace the film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was plotholes and loose ends are abound in the film thats for sure thats been a problem in seagals last few films as well but never has the result been so boring theres a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with ctx thats the drugs cool name that is never resolved br br of course in recent years the plots havent been the main draw in the seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments especially the action before i regard the action though all the other departments are poor the direction is poor or perhaps better put made to look poor who knows how director michael keusch originally intended this film between him finishing his job the reshoots by stunt man tom delmar and the editing a coherent auteur vision is completely lost the best way to describe the film is that its just all over the shop the cinematography is dull nearly inducing sleep while the droning score sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers does nothing to excite matters the cast too are poor unable to salvage anything here seagal looks bored beyond recognition and is dubbed through much of the picture clearly when plotpoints are being changed he looks tired and overweight and lethargic unlike hes looked in previous pictures too remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in seagals recent pictures the only redeemable cast member is adam croasdell as one of the villains doing a slimy brit routine he seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line because hes playing it inhuman he seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion seemingly waiting for her husbandÂ… draculabr br finally the action well its poor poorly conceived poorly shot theres not much either and theres even less featuring seagal stevo doesnt really bring out the stunt double here because theres so little to do theres even a lengthy repetitive and boring action scene on the hour mark that intercuts occasionally with little flashes of seagals stand in because clearly seagal wasnt there while the scene was being shot and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit but from what i understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state its in seagal will apparently not be working with these people again or with castel studios who continue to deliver horrifically subnuimage thats saying something materialbr br overall this is one to avoid if you are not a seagal fan seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably wont want to do anything this bad again unfortunately his next film which has already been shot with the same people promises to be even worse than this
