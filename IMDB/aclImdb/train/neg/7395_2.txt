as far as i can understand tiw watcher is the first work of a young director my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to oporto school of arts in the final creditsbr br nevertheless director ricardo pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema what is a movie how to tell a story it doesnt matter for the novice director one of the first things you learn in school when youre studying cinema is how to tell a story you learn that just like in novels in movies you should also construct your story in three acts the introduction the development and the conclusion you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax you learn this is valid for a 3hourepic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30second commercial you also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even deconstruct itbr br in rough terms tim watcher introduces us its main character and then the movie ends  the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in jeunets am√©lie there are no second or third acts in tim watcher this is not a parody or an art film thus you cant even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure you are expecting to be told a story and it doesnt happen worst than that tim watcher defines itself as a warning and one with no real purpose it doesnt make a point or at least not a valid one its point is childish with a sense of vengeance the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is manichaeanbr br i was expecting a lot more from this short the movie opens with a rather goodlooking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film i dont know the budget for this movie but judging for the thankslist in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country wheres difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakersbr br tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score thats all theres nothing else theres no plot and thats a shame because it feels like a waste of production values hardly you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a storybr br as absurd as the comparison may sound i must refer the bmw shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and overthetop stylish cinematography
