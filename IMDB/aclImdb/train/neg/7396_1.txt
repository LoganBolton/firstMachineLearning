unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopesbr br for a short film the cinematography costumes sets sound editing and everything else is very very good this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals so the quality is to be expected the problem as usual resides in the story itselfbr br thing is its not really a story to tell a story or in cinemas case show a story you need plot and conflict you need things that happen to the protagonist events these events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he cant get it tim watcher has no problems or goals hes a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind thats it so what we have here is pure exposition instead of being shown a story were simply learning things about this tim watcher individual of course considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the films short duration its hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voiceover narration in this case its used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise wed never glean in fact if it wasnt for the vo wed think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things to make it worse the vo also explains whats happening on the screen the images were shown are just decoration for the text were listening tobr br i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something but because the images dont stand on their own its impossible to say that whats left obviously has value as a measure of the crews technical capabilities not incredible but good but fails to entertain amuse thrill or at the very least show a story
