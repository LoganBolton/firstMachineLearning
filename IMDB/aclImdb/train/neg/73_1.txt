this has to be the worst piece of garbage ive seen in a whilebr br heath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish id known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him br br orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deerintheheadlights look about him i cant say i agreebr br rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldnt wait to get off the set br br im supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite clicheridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didntbr br the last 1015 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence thats not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say ill bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film wasbr br i may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly wasnt free it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back
