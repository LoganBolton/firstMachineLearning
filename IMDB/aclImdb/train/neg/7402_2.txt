this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clipscommercials trying to do their first full feature length movie on one hand the imagery camera lighting cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly expensive look and feel even the actors show a certain amount of potential  unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plotbr br in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at allbr br so 50 of the dialog consists of what the hell was that  what was that  and what the hell was that  in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasnt ever explained to thembr br the only reason why skye bennets performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didnt allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldnt even get close to i mean theres not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like thisbr br ben is this real huh  emily stop it ben a mass psychosis huh  jon somebody has to take control of this situation ben this situation cant be controlled not by you not by anybody emily not by you either ben nobr br got me goosebumps but not for horror more for the horrible attempt in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vitabr br 2 stars for the excellent technical work
