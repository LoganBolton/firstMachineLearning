this was not the worst movie ive ever seen but thats about as much as can be said about it it starts off with some good atmosphere the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating the mood is set to eerie and thennothing well somethings just somethings that clearly dont fit inand no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters and the hospital theyve taken over i mean come on biker duds some band watched a bit too much gwarbr br my personal favorite was the head demon who looks rather a lot like a middleaged trucker desperately attempting menace while simultaneously looking like hed really like prefer to sag down on an afghancovered couch undo his belt pop a can of cheap beer probably schlitz and watch the game honestly ive seen far scarier truckers at truckstops drinking coffee wwwwoooooohhhhhhoooooooo scarybr br the other monsters are even more cartoonish and even less scary at least on the dvd the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospitalthey apparently just randomly pop up in places play some bippy metal and cause people to be dead a bit barring a few good special effects and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing theres just nothing here its a backgroundnoise movie only
