i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hillbr br being a huge silent hill fan and disappointed with its movie debut i thought i would give this one a chance mind fearnet only lists this movie as dark floors not by its full name so when i saw the name mr lordi in the credits i immediately thought of the band i had a few friends in college that like them but didnt think it was important and quickly pushed the thought asidebr br the film starts out strong despite the fact creepy little girl has been done to death the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together the tense atmosphere built rapidly and every indication pointed to the film being excellent as monsters are the true stars of horror i couldnt wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped inbr br and then the first monster showed up and i found myself greatly underwhelmed by the time the second appeared i boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a megadeth concert and the silliness turned me off completelybr br over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact and the story left you wondering just what was going on but the scares were pretty much nonexistent however i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile unfortunately that was not to be the case by the time the movie had reached its climax i was in utter disbelief and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal the lead singer of lordi seriously br br was that what the movie all boiled down to a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by lordi band members the silly monster design suddenly made sense if youre going to be that corny may as well through the members of marilyn manson or even kiss in there too not to mention the fact that im pretty sure i saw the ending in one of lordis music videos a few years ago they had to go and make an entire movie off of it br br worst of all when i found out what really had been going on all i could manage was a yawn im not going to ruin it for you but i can safely say its probably a plot device youve seen before most likely more then oncebr br so unless youre a huge lordi fan stay away from this its not scary it doesnt bring anything new to the table although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies mainly silent hill and i cant stress this enough lordi is the antagonist lordi talk about a buzzkill br br really youd be better off trying to scare yourself watching slipknot music videos in other words its just not possible
