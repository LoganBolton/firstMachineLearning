i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them i rented this dvd from 2 movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the 3rd dvd player i triedbr br anyone else have this issue its really hard to give the film an unbiased review after going through such a hassle to play it for one ive never seen a finnish horror film before so i was sort of bummed that the movie was done in english also since its never made clear what is wrong with sarah she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away
