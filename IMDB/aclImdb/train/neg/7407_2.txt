1st watched 6182009  2 out of 10 dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one what we get for the next 1 hour and a halfat least it wasnt longer was a twisted horrortwilight zonezombiefestghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever theyre in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timereally
