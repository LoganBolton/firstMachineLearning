im not sure quite why i clicked contains spoiler because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil itbr br visually it mostly delivers well apart from some 80s throwback rubbermask monsters ill say now that before watching this i had never seen the band lordi nor knew anything about them bar that they won eurovision apparently the monsters in this are members of the band pretty much in their stage personas whatever anyway i didnt know this while watching i just thought the monstersdemons were mostly passable just aboutbr br im almost sure there is a semicoherent explanation behind what we see onscreen but it may actually be better not to know it it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactlybr br i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing must have been the mood i was in but i found that hella funny for some reason then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell its supposed to be about that amused me further and raised my score an extra half point to a 410br br its not scary or particularly coherent but its pretty nice visually and sonically overall far from essential but watchable dont expect too much and dont expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood
