i love cheesy horror flicks i dont care if the acting is subpar or whether the monsters look corny i liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end look i dont need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me but dark floors takes the what is this movie about thing to a whole new annoying level what is this movie aboutbr br this isnt exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill andor you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused rent this winner
