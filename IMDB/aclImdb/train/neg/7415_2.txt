what do you call a horror story without horror and story br br this is the most irritating thing about the film i get the feeling the writers never really decided whats actually going on in the film its a different thing to know it give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it but here you get the feeling the screenwriters dont know it characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows remember cube even that film knew more about itself br br ive consumed a lot of 80s horror  gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films but a lot of important things are missing we really know nothing about the characters they keep repeating empty lines over and over again the story isnt really developing  it never goes anywhere bacting is ok in this type of horror films but theres not much to act in the script we dont care about the characters theres nothing to remember about them theres not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex and most importantly  no thrills no chillsbr br you only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre they show the lordi monsters one by one but their characters dont really contribute anything for the storybr br i honestly believe that this amount of story character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment oh yeah film makers used to do that  and more  some 20 years ago i felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended too bad really
