a fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool hitting her head on something floating on the surface with rather cheesy effects this was a tv movie she floats up out of her body she floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke and black rigid figures tip into her view they look like the mannequins in her apartment i almost thought i was watching a jess franco movie as her friends revive her a black arm grabs her by the wrist and she has to struggle to get loose when she is revived she remembers everything and has a nasty bruise on her forearmbr br shortly thereafter she nearly gets hit by an outofcontrol car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her on halloween she decides with her boyfriend to go to mexico for a vacation when she gets there shes surprised to find its the day of the dead theyre annoyed by another american tourist who keeps following them and he almost drowns thembr br the designer is encouraged to join a group of people whove had near death experiences theyve all experienced the tunnel but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death one of them has and hes very anxious shes also encouraged to meet with a psychicbr br a doctor tells her about people he calls walkers the name of the novel this was based on theyre people who supposedly died of one cause that when examined prove to have died of another cause thus its like they continued walking around after dying until they died again but he blames it on poor recordkeepingbr br i watched this on the 102 minute video and it felt awfully long i cant imagine that theres actually a 192 minute version perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on tv it would better be watched that way than in one sittingbr br ive only read one gary brandner novel floater and if it is representative of his work hes not the most original of writers floater had the common plot of picked on kid kills people in revenge even the variation was pretty common picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave and in fact it has a point in common with this movie in that the kid practices astral projection and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here i dont know how closely from the dead of night follows his novel walkers i understand the howling movies dont bear much resemblance to his novelsbr br its quite a slow movie and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the presumably low budget and madefortv shortcomings there are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it it also feels very dated more early to mid 1980s than 1989 i found it to be boring a much better lowbudget movie covering similar subject matter that i dont think has dated as badly is sole survivor 1983 arguably the inspiration for the 2000s final destination movies it blows from the dead of night away
