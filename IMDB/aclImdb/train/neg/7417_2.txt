this film is so bad  dialogues story actors and actresses  everything  that its hard to imagine that well see a worse movie this year or in the following years loves brother set in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clich√©s about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film  ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people  is truly discomforting giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like suburbia or lost in translation but here his pseudoitalian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can
