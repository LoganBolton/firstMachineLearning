well i could nt get into the plot but thats just me maybe listless cameramovements at times nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage qualitythe acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies which was nice the climax is confused and disjointed but still err riveting thanx to stella stevensbr br the stunts are interesting specially because of the 70s las vegas backdrop there are a few jerky handheld cameramovements at the end which keep me guessing for a while but i dont think i ll b chasing the dvd just yet
