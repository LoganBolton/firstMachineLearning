theres really not a lot to say about las vegas lady its harmless enough but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline thats been done to death except in the case of las vegas lady i think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 yearold the plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage thats pretty much it intricate huh other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts the other women involved in the plot arent particularly memorable las vegas lady costars stuart whitman when not pawing stevens his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on filmbr br i really wanted to like this movie it does have that 70s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa 1975 but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 410  and thats probably overstating it in the end las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage
