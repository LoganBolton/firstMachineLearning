this tiresome plodding las vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in its something you look at if you have absolutely nothing else better to do the only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous stella stevens and one spends the entire program hoping shell fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears many great shots of mid70s las vegas when it was still a cool place to visit and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well otherwise one big yawn the rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still aint worth it in my humble opinion
