when a friend gave me a boxed set of 12 amazing scifihorror movies i was understandably a little cautious but since the item was a gift i really didnt truly pay my common sense much heed after allmovies for free so what if they are a little ropey after much consideration alien intruder was the first of those movies ironically it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch all i can say is if this is the best of them i shudder to think what the rest are likebr br on the surface it had some good things going for it four count em actors that i was familiar with billy dee williams tracy scoggins maxwell caulfield and jeff conaway i told myselfbilly and tracy have been in some good scifi star wars and babylon 5 respectively so they wouldnt sign up for a turkey max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into filmbut not too shoddy an actor an jeffwellhes done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add the ugly to his repertoire of moviesbr br the first clue was in the opening scenes jeff mugs his way with gusto through an im mad scene before finally killing himself an amusing cameo performance really unfortunately this is without much exaggeration the highlight of the film it goes downhill from therebr br next up we have the commander of the mission williams who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element but this assortment arent so much the dirty dozen  more like the unconvincing foursome plus one of the crims a computer hacker is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer isnt that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer pretty lame prison if you ask mebr br when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his airfix kitsbr br but the horror doesnt stop there whilst on route to the area where jeffs ship vanished the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality in which they indulge their male fantasies all well and good and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the alien menace which begins to appear there but did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong alien intruder alien boring more likebr br finally they make it to gsector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left the ending in truly optimistic rubbish film vein hints at a sequel  as if also making an appearance in this movie is a character ill nickname the sweatdroid hes supposed to be an android but apparently that fact was lost on the makeup crew who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity but dont worry hes just there to make up the body count numbers at the endbr br williams and scoggins to be truthful do very little in the film they only just barely stay awake let alone act and as i mentioned earlier jeff gets an early trip to the showers so his manicness isnt allowed to enlighten much of the film max tries his best as do a couple of the other cast members but the movie is just direly atrocious to be honestbr br the one and only halfway imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention they are all named after musicians  holly presley joplin the rest of the film is bland and uninspiredbr br made in 1992 i had thought on initial viewing it was one of those 80s straighttovideo jobs looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90s it seemsbr br its best avoided even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker but at least you can fast forward it i suppose
