as usual on imdb going by the majority vote instead of the weighted average is far more indicative of the movies entertainment value in this case the majority gives it a one how right they are to start my review ill first admit that i am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled alien intruder it does involve space and even an alien i suppose but theres no rhyme or reason at all for anything in the long run at least no actual plot basis or resolution that i can make out anywherebr br there are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious with regard to both the lines the timing and how they are spoken that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies i have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic bugs bunny seems to be ranting about somethingbr br the plot solely involves an area of space known as the gspot sorry make that gsectorand a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien virus i think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal ariel appears as a photographic negativebr br for most of the movie we see people getting shot with space weapons falling out of lofts and seemingly endless pointless close shots of wheres ariel cant find ariel pointless because most of the other shots include interaction with ariel anyway  whatever on a computer monitor commander skyler billy dee sits and watches each fantasy of the convicts vr programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it or maybe i missed somethingbr br billy dee williams took a few courses on how to act in despair prior to the filming of this we know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournfulbr br the docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semihilarious at least and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle looking much like a lego experiment gone awrybr br it seems everyone dies in this movie so why bother even the vr females get killed as if that is supposed to mean anything especially since everyone else dies anywayoutrageousbr br because of the money i save on groceries i wont rant about wanting my money back that i paid for the dvd of this the dollar that i saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewers timebr br ill just add that the story itself at least as a novel and with far more detail added could probably be quite interesting with the right authorbr br 110
