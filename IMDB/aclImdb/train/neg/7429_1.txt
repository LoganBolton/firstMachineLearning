who me no im not kidding thats what it really says on the video casebr br plot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each otherbr br find arielwheres arielcant find ariel shes right behind you you idiotbr br most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks likebr br a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virushologramvr witchglitch seems physically powerless and doesnt do a thing why cant she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine actually it wouldve been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figurebr br this isnt really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail 1950s easy rider trail film noirs night club scene even a jog on the beach in fantasyland none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz doesnt work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that swirling space ship which looks about three inches longbr br nothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are convicts or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this workbr br this is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud silences especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic oneliners including the line about frenchkissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps notbr br the original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters arent either but thats beside the point hahabr br whats kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skullhorroralien looking thing green filter added on top of that to give it more of auhgreen look which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afootbr br another odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly pixelated i dont mean a little pixelated i mean huge blocks about 116th the size of the screen wow
