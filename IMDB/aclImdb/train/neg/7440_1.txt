im going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the imdb to look up movies been motivated by nachos film the abandoned to create an account and post a comment this was hands down the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life the plot was on the verge of nonexistence and none of the puzzlepieces added up in any way whatsoever the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hilles cunning and repetitive use of the f word and brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision im disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars
