unless you are petrified of russian people or boars this movie is a snorefest actually i fell asleep about 40 minutes in  had to fight the urge to just leave the theater i wish i had a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday eveningbr br even silent hill was scarier heck even pans labyrinth was scarier im still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flickbr br to begin with im very leery of movies that use pidgin russian like this one did in the opening credits its embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends  we all cringed oh my godbr br hmm well luckily for me  probably you too this movie has already escaped my brain  i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no specifics just murky visuals that go nowhere  some languishingnowdead hope that anything would happenbr br perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i cant believe it got such great reviews here which is why i saw it  ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as wellbr br i give it a 2 because yes i fell asleep  wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up  didnt leave
