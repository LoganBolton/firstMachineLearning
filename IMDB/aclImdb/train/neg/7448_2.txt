i watched this film version of rd blackmores classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 ae version was released on video and what a poor substitution it proved to bebr br this version does not have the authentic ifeellikeimthere aspect of the ae movie the actors are for the most part wooden with sean bean the exception and the romance seems forced and contrived in fact there is no kissing until the end of the movie the triangle between john ridd lorna doone or lady lorna dugal whichever you preferand the evil carver doone isnt mentioned or expanded upon we dont get much insight into carver here or as to why he has some if any romantic feelings for lorna this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel such as counsellor doone and johns sharptongued youngest sister lizzie which were crucial to the plot the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction the political intrigue also doesnt figure in the script the way lorna came into being with the doones isnt true to the original story now dont get me wrong clive owen is a handsome and talented actor watch gosford park and king arthur for confirmation but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout and long hair it may have been a bad wig just doesnt suit him polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress see enchanted april and patriot games in which she also costarred with sean bean but she appears colorless and lackluster she has a cold sore on her lip that makeup cant hide and the costumes dont seem authentic the late robert stephens does a respectable turn as sir ensor doone although he only refers to lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter which she was reputed to be in the book also it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles maybe its the makeup and the scenery is brown cold gray and barren without so much of a hint of a sunny sky i understand that it is set in southwest england but it is green there and they do get their sunshine the portrayal of tom faggus character and his death which doesnt happen in the novel depresses the film even more the one positive note is sean beans performance as carver although it doesnt even come close to matching aidan gillens portrayal in the ae movie bean does make one mean villain in short watch this only if youve got a few hours to kill but dont expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel see any other version  but i highly recommend aes film over this tired adaptation
