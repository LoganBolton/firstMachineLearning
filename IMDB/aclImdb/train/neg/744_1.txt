holy freaking god allfreakingmighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing ive seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the gstrings imhoits a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell theres no horse theyre fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a farshot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be subpar to 1992s beyond the minds eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever
