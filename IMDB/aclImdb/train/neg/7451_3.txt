sorry not goodbr br it starts out interesting but looses its way a few minutes into the moviebr br it does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors quaid glover ermey leto etc delivers a really good performance br br it might be owed to the fact that i saw a dubbed version german but dennis quaids character was especially wooden and annoying and danny glover does not really make for a believable villain moreover jared letos character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever except saving one main characters life at one point but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place br br speaking of unnecessary scenes  the main complaint is really the tangled and clich√©ridden storyline the detective of course has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is of course suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement the killer of course wants to be tracked down and plays a catandmouse game with his opponent for years  i dont know how many movies build on a similar plot  most of them better howeverbr br the plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all eg the truck stop scene or the car at the cliffs edge etcbr br to top it off the ending tries to be original and exciting but fails completely in these regards weve seen much better finales with a similar kind of ultimatebattleonatraininaforlornwinterlandscape setup  in the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child  hokey at the least
