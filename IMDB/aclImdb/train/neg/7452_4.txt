for me this movie just seemed to fall on its face the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer i dont know whether this grows out of typecasting or simply his demeanor but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain hes a good guy and thats always obvious in his performances other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story nothing very innovative
