this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backbr br chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snlers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careerbr br avoid this movie like the plaguebr br c
