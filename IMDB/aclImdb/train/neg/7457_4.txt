chris kattan is a great sketch actor on saturday night livebut he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control he plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed wanna know the only funny parts the stuff they showed in the previews yes his rendition of take on me is funny nothing else is especially when you can tell hes trying very hard to be a physical comedian which he shouldnt have to try at because he is one and yet his demolishing the vets office bit comes off as cringingly bad this movie made me develop an eye twitch avoid it at all costs and keep watching snl
