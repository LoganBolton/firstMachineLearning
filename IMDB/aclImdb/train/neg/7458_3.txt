admittedly i didnt have high expectations of corky romano but then again who did however i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt i had no high hopes of joe dirt eitheranother recent comedy starring an snl cast memberand i ended up being pleasantly surprised but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews chris kattan is actually a talented comic actorcontrary to what you might think after watching this moviewith great energy hes been in many hilarious snl skits and i think hes one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now in this case hes given a lame pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging throughout each scene he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy not to mention he worked with much better writing kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes he doesnt even wait for the punchline he assumes well all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack in one scene he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him he comes back to the job strung out on coke now how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that hes acting hyper and onedge when hes doing the same thing throughout the whole film br br as for the rest of the cast membersvanessa shaw is really hot peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn peter falk is also wasted though he has a few funny lines that im pretty sure he improvised i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon thats too much talent too waste on a clunker like corky romano i didnt like falks last movie made all that much either but at least he had a decent role br br i chuckled a few times but i could not get a single laugh each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery and its made worse by kattans hammy acting and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out for example when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers faces he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does its a little tiny one its bad enough when you have a gag thats funny and drag it out but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out its a hell of a lot worse and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust i can go on and on about whats wrong with this socalled comedy but im not gonna waste my time like i said earlier if you predicted bad things from the trailersyou predicted right br br my score 3 out of 10
