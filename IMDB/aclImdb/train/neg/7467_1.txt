why is this film so bad well if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason then this film is it the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst the gags are predictable but that isnt what makes it bad they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would saybr br corky romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the fbi to destroy any trace of the familys crime history however it isnt that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesnt feel like any comic hijixn are there corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life againbr br i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes chris kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb slap stick humor will ferrel kattans snl partner seems to have made a full career out of it the only difference between kattan and ferrel is that ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke there is absolutely no diversity in kattans routine its hard to hear the same joke twice but for a whole movie that is just pure torturebr br the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes the gay mafia brother the awkward guy schtick and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it even with a cast that has some comedic talent chris penn peter falk the jokes that commence are tired there is no chemistry too this film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors no body seemed to care about it or even try sad thing is no body told chris kattan that
