probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that i love peter falk one of the worlds great portrayers of bumbling incompetence    and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster as pops romano he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to chris kattans manic foolishness respectable performances are also offered by richard roundtree as the harried boss vinessa shaw as a talented female fbi agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and fred ward as falks advisor and benedict arnoldbr br the plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and in the hands of a young steve martin or chevy chase could have proved a great comedic vehicle kattan who seems to idolize ernest or pee wee herman just provides a muddled mess sadly peter berg and chris penn who portray his misfit brothers both fall far short of their proven capabilitybr br there are some very funny scenes but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones what i truly miss here is what always attracted me to the leslie neilsen movies there is no second level of wit riding over the slapstick no cultural references that only the adults get  no double entendre  it is just sillybr br and by the way this doesnt all mean that i am recommending it for your 9yearold because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions
