though id heard that cama de gato was the worst brazilian movie of the decade i watched it giving it a chance after all firsttime directorproducerwriter alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us 4000 and  though it looks even cheaper  i cant begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as i watched it i realized why but whatever chances youre ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes its an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian uppermiddle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neonazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and theyre made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube  only here it lasts ninety two countem minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and its not even funnybadbr br weve all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong  theres gangrape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but clarks films  though also moralist and sexploitative  are highclass masterworks compared to this crapbr br i dont think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his nonstop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion  you do get numbminded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on stockler doesnt care a bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but hes a narcissistic controlfreak he anticipates the criticisms hes bound to get by adding subtitles with smartiecutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all is i could relate to that br br despite his megalomaniac ambitions stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure  he cant even decide if he wants gritty realism handheld video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he cant even decide where to put his camera theres use of subjective camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with itbr br its very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil with his sleepyeyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineos blat can be highly effective under good direction as in carandiru lavoura arcaica proibido proibir here hes told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly underequipped actors in recent memory he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like webcam pornbr br the film opens and ends with real interviews with typical  middleclass youth  stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what hes trying to preach in fiction but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere stockler wants to prove that brazilian middleclass youths are all present or future fascists because theyre middleclass and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neofascists are on drugs or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior i couldnt tell br br with its dogmatic selfrighteousness headacheinducing technique and mindbending boredom cama de gato is bad for a 1000 reasons but above all its harmful in a very insidious manner it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument cama de gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten
