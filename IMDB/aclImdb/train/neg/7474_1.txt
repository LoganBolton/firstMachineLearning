this program didnt do it for me although im a fan of the genre the major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character this made it a bit twodimensional and i gave up before the program was overbr br i was hoping to leave my critique there as im no movie critic however the guidelines on imdb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary it did remind me of hudson hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene and i would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers i dont doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew its just that after watching things like the wire ive come to expect great things from cop drama
