to be honest i knew what to expect before i watched this film and ive got to say it has the worst acting ive ever seen it does have its moments and on a comedy level its very entertaining but im afraid its not scary and stupidity is taken to a new level theres a lot of unnecessary gore and the plot is all over the place i have no idea why the aliens were evil and why they even came to this remote part of wales i mean whod go there anyway but i didnt care at that point because i was amused by the costumes and the bad cgi as far as bmovies go this deserves the title of being so bad its good and kudos to the filmmakers because they probably knew what they were doing long may these films continue
