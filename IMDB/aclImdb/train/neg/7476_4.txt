evil aliens owes a huge debt to peter jacksons early films bad taste and braindeadi must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about thisjake west is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up toi lost count of the amount of times a major hollywood film was quoted most notably james camerons aliensthe amount of blood and gore on show here isnt funny eitherthe latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged outmaybe it would have worked better as a short filmthe actors a poorthe direction is weak and the plot is non existenti can see what the director was trying to dothe homage he was trying to paybut others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here 410
