we all know whats like when we have a bad day at the office right well this neil simon comedy looks at what its like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office sometimes its just not worth going know what i mean and sometimes its just not worth doing something when its already been done before in 1970 with jack lemmon and sandy dennis and much better alsobr br its not that steve martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec quite to the contrary on both counts and its not that goldie hawn is equally inept either her work has been consistently good if not great ever since i first saw her in tvs rowan and martins laughin of the 1960sbr br the problem with this movie is that its not about the hapless couple at all its really about new york and why everybody should come to new york to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world thats if youre a new yorkerbr br look the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment this 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess for example not content with the star appeal of the main players there is a cameo relatively long also from rudy giuliani then mayor of new york as we all know what  giuliani bucking for president even then worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of new yorkbr br and then we have john cleese reprising his role as basil fawlty  but this time as a prancing crossdresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is in this role and in the process doing great damage to the memory of fawlty towers arguably the best british comedy series bar nonebr br why was this 1999 movie made in the 1970s new york was a dying city in many ways it was almost literally bankrupt so when made in 1970 that was the city you saw grim dark moody unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the big smoke as it was then polluted and all by 1999 things had gotten better glitz was back new york was thriving it was the big apple ready for you to bite into if you had the moxiebr br so naturally the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the american dream of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hence this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged as much as i like steve martin and goldie hawn in comedy this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great jack lemmon if youve seen the latter then definitely dont bother with this one
