someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teenage gamin ended thirty years ago br br this is one of the worst films released in years an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing this thing should have been smothered at birthbr br i hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture
