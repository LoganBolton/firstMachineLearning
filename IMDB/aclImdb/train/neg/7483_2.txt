one would think as i did that with steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese a movie should be at the very least decent these stars especially martin and cleese have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all timebr br well apparently i was grossly mistakenthis is singlehandedly one of the worst movies i have ever seen it boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny it pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across based solely on the big names i remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoeverbr br normally both with movies and in life i try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations but with this film its hard not to let loose i can count on one hand perhaps even two or three fingers major hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this this is easily one of the worst comedies ever madebr br i tried to enjoy thisi really did but the outoftowners ultimately fails miserably if you really want timeefficient entertainment just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet just please dont watch this movie
