granted this seems like a good idea steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese in a neil simon comedy where can you go wrong watch the movie and youll find outbr br in truth martin the lead is miscast hes not doing the great slapstick hes known for from movies like the jerk but instead plays a sort of inbetween character that doesnt work hawn with no one to play off of is terrible cleese is the only even partially funny memberbr br to top it off the plot is pretty stupid i cant say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense they blunder through new york not doing anything right and unfortuneatly nothing funny not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who dont live in new york arent very bright a theme repeated throughout the moviebr br in summation instead of seeing this go rent the original odd couple again
