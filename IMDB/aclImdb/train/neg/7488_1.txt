anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast script and director can put together a comedy masterpiece by the same token its easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid hollywood boreathon this movie was pathetic had it not been for john cleese a comic genius i would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloidbr br neil simon wouldnt write another screenplay for this version he said that he couldnt improve on the first and im surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldnt sue for defamation of humorbr br jack lemmon and sandy dennis did such a wonderful job in the original what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one how could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny i dont know but one thing i do knowits no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular
