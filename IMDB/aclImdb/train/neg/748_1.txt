i love movies and ill watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i cant watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and monotone the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mothers basement with minimal software andthe long scenes of justwalking and this movie is three hours long i didnt even make it 15 minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short ummm instead of naming this war of the worlds lets name this war of the walking long distances this cost 5 million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening songbr br oh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people thats hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for 20 seconds afterwardbr br solike i said if you are a fan of boring stale actionless movies here is one for you dvd collection but i didnt write this for you i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or moneybr br i know this is by the book but the book isnt that long and im a complete book wormnerdgeekwhatever but why just get the steven spielberg version its not all that good but its 10 times better than this br br i give this a big fat zero out of 10
