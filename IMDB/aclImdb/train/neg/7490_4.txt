this movie was disappointing it was incomplete and dull while alec baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and just prosecutor not to mention executive producer the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible pathbr br sure nobody wants to defend the nazis point of view but that was the point of the nuremberg trails four hours of simply bashing on the nazis cmon thats been done alreadybr br i really think alec baldwin should just stick to being kim bassingers husbandbr br right after the movie ended tnt showed the 1959 movie trail at nuremberg that movie is far superior
