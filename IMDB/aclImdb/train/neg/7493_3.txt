i couldnt believe my eyes when i watched nuremberg yesterday on dutch television it starts very slowly the backgrounds of the nuremberg trials become clear step by step the germans have a funny english accent but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series the audience gets to see the most shocking horrific footage i have ever seenbr br it is important that people get to see such footage although i absolutely dont agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material but in this film it was completely ridiculous it was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary tv series it was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy in stead of trying to move us with welldone scenes inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoints the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skinandbones camp inmates it doesnt show any respect for the victims of the holocaustbr br im very angry
