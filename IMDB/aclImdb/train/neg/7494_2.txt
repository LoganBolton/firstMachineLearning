that word true in this films title got my alarm bells ringing they rang louder when a title card referred to americas civil war as the war between the states the circumlocution preferred by diehard southerners jesse james  thief slaveholder and murderer  is described as a quiet gentle farm boybr br how dishonest is this movie there is no mention of slavery far less of the documented fact that jesse jamess poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war and that jesse and his brother frank actively fought to preserve slavery according to this movie all those civil war soldiers were really fighting to decide whether missouri is a northern state or a southern state  thats all missouri its a candy mint its a breath mint black people are entirely absent from this movie except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars one of whom wears a help the poor sign thats very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten some shots of 19thcentury newspapers are inaccurate too with 20thcentury type fontsbr br this film has a weird flashback structure theres some very impressive stunt riding and some fine work by stunt horses and one excellent montage i savoured one line of dialogue some of those boys will never taste beans again the movie gets a few facts straight agnes moorehead as jesses mother conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of pinkerton here called remington in which jesse jamess reallife mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm some errors here are pardonable during his bushwhacking days the real jesse james accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger but robert wagner in the title role here does not have a stumpfinger ive seen a photo of jesse jamess real wife if she had looked half as glamorous as hope lange looks in this movie jesse james might have stayed home morebr br theres plenty of revisionism here and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles but many of this movies errors were avoidable jesse jamess mentor william quantrill is mentioned several times but all the actors mispronounce his name we see jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate twostorey house where he will soon die after paying a rent of 18 actually jesse jamess last residence at 1318 lafayette street st joseph missouri was a simple onestorey cottage renting for 14 there was no upper storey  so when jesse james is killed his wife could not come running from upstairs as hope lange does here she was actually in the kitchenbr br one continuity error robert wagner with no stunt double does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back  but when he gets up the rope binding his wrists has vanishedbr br the screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates following the northfield robbery attempt jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday the actual northfield bank raid by the james gang 7 september 1876 was two days after jesse jamess birthday maybe he meant next years birthday later we see jesse and his wife moving into their st joseph home on a fine summer day while jesse tells her what he plans to do when christmas eve arrives  but in real life mr and mrs jesse james moved into that house on 24 december 1881  so this scene should be on christmas eve these errors were entirely avoidablebr br some of the fictionalisations here dont make sense according to this movie the northfield bank raid failed because one fictional henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires if this had actually happened it would indeed have hampered the james gangs getaway  but it wouldnt have affected the robbery itself which failed for other reasonsbr br there are good performances here by jeffrey hunter as frank james moorehead alan hale jnr as cole younger and by stage actress marian seldes in a rare screen role i was disappointed by robert wagner normally an underrated actor elsewhere wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes villains and morally ambiguous characters here he cant seem to decide whether to depict jesse james as a goodie or a baddie  so he doesnt much bother john carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises jesse and his wife at their wedding in fact jesse james was baptised in childhood by his uncle a methodist minister  but perhaps this second baptism is a toppingupbr br jesse james was no robin hood i doubt that robin hood was robin hood either but thats another story there is not one single documented instance of jesse james ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family after some of his holdups he didnt even split the swag with the rest of his gang in this movie jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever in reality the night before his death jesse james and the ford brothers stole horses that jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the platte city bank as preparation for most of his robberies jesse james stole horses from local farmers  the same poor folk who in the inaccurate legends were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse i cringed at one scene here in which the fictional jesse james is so goldurn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudesbr br the true not much story of jesse james is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer and likewise dishonest about the civil war for the very impressive stunt work one good montage and a few fine acting turns ill rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10
