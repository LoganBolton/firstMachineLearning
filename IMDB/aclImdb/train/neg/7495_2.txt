foxs the true story of jesse james 1957 is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 tyrone powerhenry fonda classic jesse james im not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the hamfisted screenplay must surely have something to do with itbr br in the late thirties and forties tyrone power was foxs top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head darryl zanuck started to groom newcomer robert wagner to take his place this was a major error on zanucks part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement with the possible exceptions of broken lance 1954 and between heaven  hell 1956 it is hard to think of wagner distinguishing himself in anything also jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to wagners jesse in the true story of jesse james borrowed from the studio the previous year this actors one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john fords classic the searchers but his playing here along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers is nothing short of boring neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles they totally miss the mark lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner as the robin hood of the american west comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as agnes moorhead barely getting a look in as ma jamesbr br the best aspects of this uninvolving soso western is the wonderful cinemascopecolour cinematography by the great joe mcdonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh harline
