its difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred i have of this film but ill trybr br every other word was an expletive the sex scenes were uncomfortable drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm if not offensive to italianamericansbr br im not saying the acting was terrible because leguizamo sorvino brody espisito et al performed well butalmost every character in the film i despised not since the bonfire of the vanities have i disliked every character on screen
