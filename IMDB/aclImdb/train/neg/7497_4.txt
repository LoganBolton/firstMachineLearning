after seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out spike lee was directing i was excited to hear about this event i wasnt alive at the time i didnt live in new york so i expected more of a history lesson than anything what i got was some interesting acting a lot of sex and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the son of sam i guess the film wasnt about the son of sam but it was a peek into the summer of 77 label me disappointedbr br
