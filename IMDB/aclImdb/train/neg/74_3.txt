they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent the bored young wives of wealthy older men ok there are lots of myths about ned kelly but there are also a lot of well documented facts still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation i mean this is not the robin hood story not the arthurian legends not beowulf not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99 guesswork its only a couple of lifetimes ago my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged br br so its silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story having recently read peter careys excellent novel the true history of the kelly gang i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein but no the fact is that mick jaggers much derided 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall which isnt saying a whole lot for itbr br glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd ill give it 310 and thats only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous
