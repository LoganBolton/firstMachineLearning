spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen he is the critics darling because he supposedly makes films with a message or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being differentbr br summer of sam does not even do that well the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone and so is the narrative the plot is a lot like do the right thing the portrayal of guidos or for the pc set italianamericans of which i happen to be one is straight out of eddie murphys raw only eddie murphys impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much taller africanamerican is much much more believable than the cartoonish broad italian caricatures shown here the john leguizamo character being a possible exceptionbr br is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up as soon as richie came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach i could already see him being accused of being the killer this character had the most integrity in the whole film so of course lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd what a white bearded cliquebr br someone please please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants so maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we wont have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i wont have to see critics some of them whom i respect ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes
