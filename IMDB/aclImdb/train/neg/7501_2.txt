i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society i didnt expect spike lee to forcefeed me more garbage on racial tension mobjustice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers lee has presented an extreme opinionbr br the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90min format with more focus less tangential subplotsbr br dont even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee in such a case the theatre is worth it this is not an escapist movie
