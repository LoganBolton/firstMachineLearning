i have always liked spike lees movies but this one was a total waste of 2 12 hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings the talking dog was laughable you know youre in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot im not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point unless its a xxx movie all in all we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort
