im afraid that i have to disagree with the majority i found spike lees latest a wee bit boring although he was trying something different ie not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer i dont think it worked too wellbr br theres really a bit too much going on  vinny john leguizamo and dionnas mira sorvino relationship ritchies adrien brody lifestyle and then the local mafia types the story is good but at the end thats all you have  2 or 3 stories with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film br br there are some good points though all scenes with the son of sam killer david berkowitz look very nice colour saturation etcand the acting is pretty good throughoutbr br overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings it just wasnt strong enough in the endbr br
