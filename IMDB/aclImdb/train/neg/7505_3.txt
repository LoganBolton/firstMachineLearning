this long winded film turns out to be less about berkowitz and his effect on nyc but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italianamericans known locally as guidos the problem is that guidos are uninteresting no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in they are already living caricatures so lee only amplifies them rather than simply portraying thembr br when someone has a caricature done of themselves they dont go home and say hey lets make the ears and nose even bigger thats what lee has done in this film the most interesting characters in the film are the two adrian brody and jennifer esposito who wish to escape the guido lifestyle top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters particularly john leguizamos and you get a nice film to fall asleep by especially considering its lengthy run timebr br one more strike against it for someone proclaiming to be a yankees fan and has grown up in new york spike lee should know how to spell phil rizzuto which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits
