i wish spike lee had chosen a different title for his film summer of sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer david berkowitz its not its a gritty earthy portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of 77 when berkowitz terrorized that citybr br the film follows several young fictional characters in an italianamerican neighborhood and their reactions to the son of sam threat theres vinny and his wife dionna theres richie and ruby and several other charactersbr br the problem is that these characters are not likable they are routinely annoying and at times unbearable lee then belabors their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil there are at least two protracted fight scenes between vinny and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless gabfests  over and over i kept wondering wheres the film editorbr br meanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the son of sam menace which is too much in the background lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that arising from neighborhood vigilante groupsbr br the acting is uniformly good that combined with 70s disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an italianamerican neighborhood in nyc in 1977br br the films atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to offset a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people
