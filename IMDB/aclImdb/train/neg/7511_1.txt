this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies ive seen in a very long time ive never liked spike lee but thought id give this one a try bad mistake the movie is supposed to show how the son of sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 what it really did was center around the most boring characters that i doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems marriage problems and so on etc the scenes that depict the murders are just that and nothing more a shooting and then its back to saturday night fever whats even more ridiculous is spike lees choice to show up as a reporter in the movie spike trust me youre no hitchcock stay out of the movies it makes them even worse off the most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot spike what were you thinking when you made this film not thinking at all is my guess people who think theyll see a crime drama take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser youre better off watching jerry springer in this case waste of film i gave it a 1 out of 10 awful dud
