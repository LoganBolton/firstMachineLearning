i had to walk out of the theater after an hour all i was seeing was people cheating on wives schtupping like dogs in a rut and using the fword like a diabetic using equalbr br no thanksbr br it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate talk about it and swear at each otherbr br the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1several murders occur 2 vinnie sees murder scene 3 vinnie stares moodily across atlanticeasthudson river 4 vinnie cheats on wife and 5 joey most sympathetic character in the show gets kicked out of his parents house more than that i didnt wait to seebr br the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb but there was nothing for them to do the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happenbr br sorry spike take some lessons from notting hill or shawshank redemption either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships
