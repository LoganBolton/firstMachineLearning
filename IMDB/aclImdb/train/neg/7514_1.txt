a low budget effort from texas thats at least filmed well but that is little consolation bad acting or should i say bad overacting a pretty limp story line thats nothing new bad special effects bad bad bad seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween which is done every year but this year things are different has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots of which there are a lot putrid puerile definitely avoidable at all costs
