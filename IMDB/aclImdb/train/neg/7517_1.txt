one out of ten stars br br because if it was it gets an f holy mother mary of god was this bad i mean i gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film but it let me down at every turn like so many other b movies the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources but the execution was ridiculous its a shame they attached the good name of halloween to this fiascobr br the basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual halloween haunted house fund raiser when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell well thats the idea anyway but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boys relationship escapades abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot very little of the actual story is devoted to halloween or the mysterious spell book it actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble br br the film is essentially about frat boy relationships this is not what the movie is billed as im tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm the acting is about as bad as it gets its atrocious the script is unintentionally funny the cinematography is just plain lazy the whole film is amateur night this movie actually makes the syfy channel movie productions look like masterpiecesbr br the last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they werent producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences the evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as i almost feel like crying as i write this review wow i mean wow this thing was an undecipherable chopped up disaster
