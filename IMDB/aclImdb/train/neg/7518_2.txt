horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets bad acting and a bit of panache i think the film is just missing panache because one thuddingly dull scene after another people make laughably harmless clawhanded grabs at the air if it werent so boring it might be funnybr br a horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like college kids in a haunted house in much the same way the evil dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline hallows end unfortunately doesnt go a long way actually it doesnt go anywhere it spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama i have nothing against character development not even in a horror movie but these are strictly onedimensional characters the alphamale the milquetoast the um throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes spending fortyplus bloodless droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed startedbr br well implied bloodshed anyway when the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house ones a vampire ones wearing or scrubs and some white pancake they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes the dead hate the living using a similar theme is a masterwork in comparison there isnt really any gore to speak of nor are there any real scaresbr br ive thought about this one from almost every approach if it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful horror movie which would explain why things moved so slowly the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it if it was supposed to be a genuine blood  guts horror movie which would explain the schlock wheres the blood and guts and the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie ive ever seen its the kind of movie that though it doesnt have a narrator through the film is bookended by voiceovers because all of the meaningless dialogue just wasnt enoughbr br this was a hard one coming out of it i wonder if ive just sat through a christian horror film maybe the i know hell exists of the opening wasnt meant that way but there are some hints or misdirection im not sure which for all the profanity in the film a line like goshdarnit comes off a little absurd and so does most of the crucifix worshipping godfearing and satandreading especially after some lecherous ta sex scenes one heterosexual one lesbianbr br if it a christian company highland mysts logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance then this film weighs in heavily for the atheist camp an omnipotent being cant be this bad a filmmakerbr br
