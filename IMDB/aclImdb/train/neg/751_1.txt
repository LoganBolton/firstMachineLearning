i honestly believe that anyone considering filmmaking be subjected to this mindboggling failure like the films of edward wood jr in the 60s and 70s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts reediting their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the studios prescreening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience perhaps he would have cut 75 or the walkingrunningstrolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutesbr br film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every filter effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himselfherself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn outbr br critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever madebr br beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad madeforcable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre resultsbr br i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current postlucas and postspielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off some cant even come close to it
