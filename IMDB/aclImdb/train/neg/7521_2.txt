i probably give this more credit than it deserves because its halloween i was just at knotts scary farm and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween moviebr br oh and it only cost me one dollarbr br usually ill ffwd through a movie like this to get to the good stuff but i resisted the urge here and im still not sure why it was obvious from the opening shots this wasnt a real movie not even a bmovie its more in the category of the decoteau horror movies like the brotherhood that are shot on filmlook video for about 50 cents in fact i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something there were no cutaway shots too expensive to do multiple camera setups and flat lighting butits hard to pinpoint theres something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a halfdecent movie the fact that hes doing even a halfdecent job is commendable and this movie has its share of meritsthe acting isnt bad the photography is pretty good if too bright to be scary there are some surprises and the whole thing is sort ofdifferent somehowbr br a bunch of college kids are for some unknown reason stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplotits interesting that this couple seems to be the most wellrounded in the movie yes theres a sex scene but it isnt salaciousor at least no more so than youd find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex its rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation br br the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the stupid kids have sex and get killed vibe of the 80s slashers its hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist the genre has been done to death im not sure if its good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre without irony as if it was still a living genre but i appreciated the attemptbr br which is why i sat through it sometimes you just want to watch a mindless nobudget aforeffort horror film there really was too much set up not enough gore endless plotholes deadends and clich√©s and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisionedbut at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool id pay to go to that haunted house if it existed and didnt mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if ill never watch this againbr br oh and possible spoiler but there was great brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin i used to be claustrophobic but ive changed ha ha good one
