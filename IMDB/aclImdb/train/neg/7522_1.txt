wowwhere to beginpicked this up at big lots for only 299 thats three bucks ill never see againeverand for what ill tell ya an hour and fifteen minutes of boring boring boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box may the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for all eternity follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore not even good gore mind you and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense awful awful awfulbr br was there any redeeming qualities well on the joe bob briggs scale there were six breasts involved but thats hardly worth my long lost three bucks without those this coulda been on scifi at say two or three in the morningbr br bmoviefreak
