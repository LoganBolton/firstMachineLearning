in this sequel bruce is still called billy lo get it bruce billy lo lee no but apart from that thats all it has in common with the other movie billy doesnt seem to be an actor anymore he seems to be in another country hes more like a spy hes the only cast member to return and sadly they kill him off to make way for a new character his brother bobby sadly when bruce dies the movie pretty much dies with him this was extremely poorly made it seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming the footage works for a while its not too obvious at first but soon bruce is always shown in the dark all the time he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that its not bruce playing the part sadly when he dies the movie changes i cant help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep bruce alive but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as bobby does not appear until billy is dead its hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and bruce is a hard act to follow so its hard to now accept bobby as the star bruce is never seen again in this movie i think they should have made this sequel without bruce he has a lame role in this movie people hoping to see a new bruce lee movie will be disappointed to see that although hes given the top billing he only has a featuring role even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit if there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about its the scene where billy fights in a plant nursery ironically it doesnt even use bruce lee footage mind you they did it more convincingly in no retreat no surrender not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable bruces girlfriend colleen camp is never mentioned my advice is to turn it off as soon as bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother nothing else in the movie is worth watching i found it really sad to see bruce die i dont see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from enter the dragon this was a cheap way of trying to cash in on bruces name oddly this and the original are credited in bruces filmography thankfully so far no one has tried anything like this again 1981 was the year of bruces last movie appearance it was a sad way to end it but thankfully this is proof that bruces movie career should be left alone
