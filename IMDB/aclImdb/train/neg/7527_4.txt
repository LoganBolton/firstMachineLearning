there are so many stupid moments in tower of deathgame of death 2 that you really wonder if its a spoof at times it felt like i was watching a sequel to kung pow rather than a bruce lee filmbr br to be honest this film has bugger all to do with game of death if anything its more a sequelremake of enter the dragon incorporating many elements of that film  particularly the actual footage bruce lees character billy lo apparently investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the mans daughter when the body is stolen during the funeral  billy is also killed and its up to his wayward brother to avenge both mens deathsbr br tong long stars as brother bobby lo and doesnt really have the sort of charisma to carry the film his fighting abilities are very good however bruce lee obviously turns up thanks to no longer deleted footage simply to cashin on the legacy saying that on the whole the footage is actually editedin better than in game of death but it doesnt stop the film from being a messbr br ok so the fights are actually very entertaining dare i say mindblowing and make the film at least watchable but there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience first off theres the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate or is that mental institution seriously the nutter eats raw venison drinks deers blood carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions  this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him  you half expect someone to escort him back to his roombr br in fact this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived i turned it off however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end much like god was the whole reason for watching while the story is an embarrassment the action is very good and contains excellent choreographybr br but even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by what we were told was that the tower of death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground this sounded great like a twist on bruce lees original idea with different styles of fighting on each level could this be the game of death that was originally planned no the film should have been named generator room of death because thats as far as the tower goes of yes there were indeed one or two different styles there were foil clad grunts leopardskinned henchman and stupid monk its as though enter the dragon had never been made with the plot being a poor imitationbr br worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes but so stupid sometimes that it hurts if this was intended then fine thumbs up however for recreating that projector room scene from enter the dragon
