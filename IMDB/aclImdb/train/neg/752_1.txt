is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and youll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didnt have much of a budget compared to spielbergs herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an insurmountable handicap ive seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells novella  and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielbergs budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal hes foisted on usbr br primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show hes returning  clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour thats all that happens ok ill grant that one extended excursion from the main characters house to the impact site on horsell common to show that its a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a firstyear film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkityyak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a featurelength film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessertbr br thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from hg wells text else wed have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone cant convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks hes a filmmaker so hes content to mouth the words and swallow the meaningbr br secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesnt need dazzling technical effects some really potent scifis have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects dont need to be complex they can even be crude eg fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george palbyron haskins 1953 version but they must be handled well unfortunately hines effects are both crude and incompetent  tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum  martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort  skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream  the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice  and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect thats less than convincing fine we can work around that just dont use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away its not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please dont show it twice but no hines wont listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those 180 minutes somehow boybr br next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks hes getting a bargain  more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree lets have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better  nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they arent even good amateurs but this neednt prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting thats what directors are for and editors which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if americas butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near threehour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie  not sequences but single frames creating a herkyjerky effect thats nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890s if he was i can say he doesnt know how to do it
