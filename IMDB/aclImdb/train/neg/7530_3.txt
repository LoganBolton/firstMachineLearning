i found this movie boring monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried shallow upbeat ending that didnt ring true to the overall story following these characters through a weekend of awful events unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isnt my idea of a watchable interesting movie and i got very tired of its one note theme and couldnt wait for it to endin fact i almost stopped about halfway through the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant though the acting was good a small movie with small ambitions and small appealsorry but it just didnt make it with me and i love good small films this one just didnt jell though i kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would i was disappointed especially after two local reviewers put it on their years 10 best list id strongly recommend watching the house of sand insteadnow theres a good small film
