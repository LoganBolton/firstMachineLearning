something i really love about this womans short films was the elusiveness of theme  especially in living with happiness this film has some nice beginnings  unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue patchy performances and very television coveragebr br its once again charming television and very ordinary cinema the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial but the sentiment is good so we cant complain too muchbr br i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesnt demand so much boring clarity
