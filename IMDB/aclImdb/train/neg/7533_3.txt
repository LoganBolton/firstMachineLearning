the film had some likable aspects perhaps too many for my taste it felt as though the writerdirector was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters not once a few timesbut all of the time br br this is the job of television not cinema br br the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horlers performance as the pregnant friend br br i felt as though justine clarkes performance was wan her reactions to things felt forced as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonists expressions i also cant believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence br br i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences this is a lazy device especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film andor where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest br br that said there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity infusing it with passion and handcrafted charm br br i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked who knows if theres a god like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was br br perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife im giving up smoking br br an antismoking commercial a tac ad with some tasteful animation i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark  it was all too much
