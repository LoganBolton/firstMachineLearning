id like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan with a few notable exceptions and i generally have a low opinion of socalled otakus as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spikyhaired bigeyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors such as the plot and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash fatal fury the motion picturebr br  as seen through the glassy witless eyes of an otaku theres little to find fault with in fatal fury theres plenty of quirky japanesey humor oneonone duels some dramatic moments and everything is beautifully drawn but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched predictable plot with cliched predictable characters culminating in a cliched predictable ending the love scenes are hilariously overblown the scene in which sulia heals terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment but its virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it and of course fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon ta this is supplied gratuitously by the hugebreasted mai shiranui and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name oh boy were treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle in which all the main characters engage the allpowerful main villain in oneonone combat in turn thats some thing thats always amused me even when battles in animes arent taking place in a tournament they always happen as if they were regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoeverbr br  otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury so would fatal fury have been good if it wasnt an anime the answer is an emphatic no all of this movies charm what little of it there is resides in the actual drawings had fatal fury not been an anime it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000 if the show was still on the air thats the key this is nothing more than a laughably bad bmovie in the guise of an anime epic if youre a fan of movies so bad that theyre actually entertaining consider renting fatal fury or catch it on the scifi channel as it is definitely one of those if youre an otaku please wake up and realize that a good 90 of the stuff youre watching is garbage as for everyone else buy a dreamcast and fatal fury mark of the wolves but dont even consider seeing this movie
