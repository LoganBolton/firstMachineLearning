the wicker man starring nicolas cage is by no means a good movie but i cant really say its one i regret watching i could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence with a hallucination etc but its just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this instead heres five reasons why you should watch the wicker man even though its bad br br 5 its hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution if nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is basedbr br 4 for a cheesy horrorthriller it is really aesthetically pleasing its pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery there are also many nicely composed shots it is a very good looking moviebr br 3 nicolas cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature whether youre a fan of his or not it seems as if its impossible for cage to play a normal guy there is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays and personally i am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does whether nicolas cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch he is terrible in the wicker man but in the most wonderful kind of waybr br 2 a student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest antifeminist movie ever made see you could write this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society also the similarities between this summersisle society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth notingbr br 1 if youre reading this theres probably a good chance you may have seen a youtube video that has become very popular a collection of highlights from the movie including cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous aaghh the bees my eyes line these scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the films entiretybr br i bought the used dvd at blockbuster for about 5 dollarswhen you work that out its about a dollar per reason its a pretty good dealbr br note the unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and its better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue which features a cameo from james franco
