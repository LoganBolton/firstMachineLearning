this movie is suppose to be a mysterious serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl however 30 minutes into the movie it turns into a funny unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes i cant imagine anyone not laughing when cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he bear punches that old lady the lines characters and acting are all poorly done from the getgo ive always liked nicolas cage as an actor but he has made some terrible movies this year this being by far the worst one yetbr br i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense storygripping thriller if you really want to enjoy this story go rent the original however if you intend on watching it get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously thats the only way you enjoy this film
