first this movie was not that badit was entertainingat least to me for probably all the wrong reasons i have never seen the original so cant compare the twobr br this movie reminded me of that weird christopher reeve movie village of the damned the two movies have different plots but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in bothbr br the wicker man is suppose to be a mysterythrillermen please dont anger the women movie i dont know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little offbr br nicholas cage his glorious bad self goes to a secluded island called summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders br br cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world stupidbr br things get weirder when the large amishesquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl his fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festivalbr br in this movie males do not fare so well a sick twisted display of feminism br br i found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit i think there were too many potholes in this movie i find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird while most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism i would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed this movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice it is not a thriller it should be categorized as just strange
