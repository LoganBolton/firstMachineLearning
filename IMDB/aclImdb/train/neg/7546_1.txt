im a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this i couldnt believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldnt be bad to watch it at least oncebut trust me it isbr br i havent seen the old moviebut why would they want to remake a movie like this the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesnt fall under any of those and just remains dumbi just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point  but it never does br br so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television
