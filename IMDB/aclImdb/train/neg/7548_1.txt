sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness i remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the rerelease of the excorcist really nervous laughter it punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of satan coming out of a 12 year old girl in the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic the wicker man however it made me think that this new wickerman is about as scary as the south park character scuzzlebut the friendly forest monster with tvs patrick duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm whos favorite hobby is weaving wicker basketsbr br 3 years ago a friend of mine in hollywood told me that he heard that nicolas cage was going to do a remake of the film i started laughing and my friend keith got mad at me touting nicolas cage as a great actor i just didnt think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers i was right gone is the realness the outstanding original music the originality the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue instead we have horror movie clichés affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart like many of the countless hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground playing wickermanbr br the original film takes place on a remote scottish isle where a scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named rowan morrison in the new spin a california cop cage is lured to an island of the coast of washington state by his exgirlfriend to find her missing daughter she sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago the crash still haunts him in part because the girls body was never found yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north alone to help his exgirlfriend find her daughter he arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of wiccans many of whom seem like they didnt get call backs for roles in the village and like the village it isnt long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unisonbr br i think that the opportunity in hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry i think someone like nicolas cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks we needed a bad remake of the wickerman like we needed yet another 911 movie im starting to wonder if nicolas changed his surname from coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so
