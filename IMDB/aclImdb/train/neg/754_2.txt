i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr well yes if you exclude the dwarfs the cast of thousands the great special effects the big battles the strong characterization the decent plot the good acting the classy direction and everything else which leaves you with the walking and boy does this film do walking if mr piano had his way this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble youve never seen so much walking in a movie if this really had a 20m budget most of it must have gone on mr pianos shoes because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does which explains why theres no money left for decent effects a decent video camera or proper actors honestly its like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes even on fastforward this is a looonnnggg walkbr br as for the scifi stuff i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the storybr br i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs
