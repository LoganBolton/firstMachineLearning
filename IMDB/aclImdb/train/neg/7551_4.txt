well finally got to see the remake last night in london unintentionally hilarious sexless and devoid of any real humour i dont really know where to start whilst i was entertained by this strange homage it didnt really move me the acting is screamingly hammy there is no original music the costumes are far too disney there is a ridiculous six months later insert after the burning of nic cage which didnt come soon enough for my liking the bit with cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various baddies on the island its such a weird remake that i cant quite believe i saw it it reminded me of something that the comic strip presents would have done in the eighties a bit like their hollywood interpretation of the miners strike very strange
