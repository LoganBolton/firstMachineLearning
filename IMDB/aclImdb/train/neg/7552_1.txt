the wicker man has done the impossible it replaced cat woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind yes its really that bad so bad that when sitting down to write this review i thought to myself if i had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes i might actually go for the red hot needlesbr br neil labute created a rare movie where joel schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind yeah thats some bad direction right therebr br i think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line some sacrifices must be made sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crimeor at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment seriously the movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and i would still rather with be stuck on gilligans island with only pictures of condoleezza rice then find myself stranded therebr br the most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart ive ever heard in a movie theater thats not a joke nor is it fictional ive never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter through out the entire film i cant tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly i honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since deez powder and i pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia soon to be a law before all nic cage films write to your congressman today dont delay at one point i actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and anna ferris is going to show upoh how i wishbr br nic cage throws out so much ham per frame im thinking of having a cholesterol test done today to think that i ever thought sean penn was a dck for slamming nics acting oh hes still a dck just lesser of oneyes sean penns dck was lessened because of this film do us all a favor nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks you cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars his best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit like the fart not a joke or a functional moment during this review then proceeds to run amok like conan obrians masturbating bear but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out hes to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of burning man and lilith fair yes i just spoiled the ending for youand if you knew any better youd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend i sat through this crapfest so you dont have tobr br about half way through this little misadventure i kept thinking to myself jack bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real timeok 35 minutes if kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first even steve martin as inspector clouseau could have figured this out in under an hourand you sir are no inspector clouseaubr br if for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet take the bulletbr br somewhere uwe boll is laughing at us all
