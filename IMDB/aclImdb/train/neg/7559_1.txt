this has got to be one of the worst fillums ive ever seen and ive seen a few it is slow boring amateurish  not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot the actors do not act i cant blame them  they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersislebr br there is not one moment in this film that rings true  not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career
