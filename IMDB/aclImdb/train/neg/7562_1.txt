i havent seen the original but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far wicker man is the worst movie ive seen this year maybe even in two years i wish i could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see itbr br ill give it two positive nods the sarcasm of cages character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful sorry thats it here come the jeers the movies plot is only propelled forward because other characters wont give cage any straight answersand he puts up with this how this could go on for over an hour of my timemuch less days in the movie is beyond me br br not to mention that the plot is full of holes you leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library how anyone could read this script and think yes people should pay 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like is beyond mebr br do not go see this flick or even rent it on dvd
