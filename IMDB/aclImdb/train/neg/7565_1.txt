this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that ive spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies youd probably say thats hard to imagine but nevertheless its true after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew that i had to see it if youre a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldnt you the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting unfortunately the movie is none of thesebr br from the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop if youre reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and fortyfive minutes im afraid you are in for disappointmentbr br why is it so bad you might be asking yourself let me tell you the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious the script was at best laughable there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasnt the acting was absolutely dreadful i like nicholas cage but this was a miss without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique finally the story is completely transparent you can see the end of this movie coming a mile awaybr br i am not usually a very harsh critic frankly when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mysterysuspensehorror i just want to be surprised this movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment do yourself a favor and go see something else
