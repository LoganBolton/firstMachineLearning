prior to this release neil labute had this to say about the 1973 original its surprising how many people say its their favorite soundtrack im like come on you may not like the new one but if thats your favorite soundtrack i dont know if i want you to like my film br br neil a word you might want to sit down for this too as lord summerisle says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent see neil the thing about the original is that paul giovannis soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical along with richard and danny thompson and bert jansch it practically kickstarted the 1970s folk new wave to undermine it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams or the buddy holly story without buddy holly the results one of the most breathtakingly arrogant pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly stallones get carterbr br the original had apparently left nicolas cage disturbed for about two weeks so disturbed during that fortnights window that he pitched the idea of reimagining one of the most nuanced films about interfaith struggle ever devised to a writerdirector previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism its like some parlor game what would you get if sam peckinpah took on bambi or gaspar irreversible noe remade love actuallyactually id quite like to see that unfortunately someone took this parlor game seriously all labutes succeeded in doing is ripping out the originals guts while saddling it with his own gormless sex war preoccupationsbr br after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash cages highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor then he receives a letter from exfiancée willow woodward this one trades on namehomages for kudos now living on the private island community of summersisle  that extra s stands for superfluous  and wants edward to help locate missing daughter rowanbr br summersisle it transpires is a femaledominated joint conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the salem witch trials here the matriarchs observe the olde ways and the few males are nearmute breedmules its like lilith fair on a grand scale summersisles main export is honey  a symbolic and literal headache for edward as hes allergic to bees beekeepers cries edward they seem to be everywhere on this island well thats probably because summersisles main export is honeybr br while making his investigations edward overhears of an oncoming mayday ritual called the time of death and rebirth he discovers the previous years crop failed nearly dies from bee stings and eventually comes to the conclusion a conclusion which admittedly couldnt be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands that rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest he also meets the queen bee of the hive sister summersisle burstyn who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous wicker man the drone must die br br first the good news any concerns cage would be airlifted from the wicker mans flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black cia helicopters can be laid to rest he toast thats about it for the good news this is a story whose chapters were carefully written intones burstyn with sublime irony though retaining the basic catandmouse premise and credits typography whats left subjects the original to a scorchedearth policybr br crucial to shaffers original screenplay was that his christian copper in accordance with ritual came to the island of his own free will  and most importantly was a virgin the perfect sacrifice in reducing matters to a sexual as opposed to a religious powerstruggle labute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice by the time cage has worked out he was the bait you honestly couldnt care lessbr br and cage is one of the very worst things in this a lumbering drawling donkey  an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth goddamit he moans after he hallucinates a drowned rowan with all the mental torment of a man whos set his morning alarm clock halfanhour too early one hopes its his characters frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state  alternately fatigued then full of preppy overbearing vim if so its a fine portrayal of an undistinguished iq addled with antidepressants if notit doesnt bear thinking about as willow the saucereyed beahan is similarly dreadful presenting her lines as if in competition with cage for themosthalfhearteddelivery while burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince whos afraid of naomi wolf br br every element that made the original great  the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs the ingenious score the dialogue lord summerisles majestic you did it beautifully has been replaced with the rather less attractive you did it excellently whoah dude  have been substituted for a meandering battleofthesexes thriller with occasional crashbang wallop namely walloping women this is a labute flick after all cages sister beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin to em hyuk hyukbr br the closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché in a bar two guys run into a couple of summersisle maidens on shore leave flirtyfishing for fresh martyrs at the moment of their successful pickup you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camerabr br one more thing keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count anything up to 10 tend to be not much cop the wicker man has 18 producers in total
