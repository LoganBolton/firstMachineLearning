the story younggoon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg in the institution she meets park ilsun a young man who develops a bond with herbr br if youre reading this you probably already know how talented chanwook park is but im a cyborg is a big departure from familiar and sadly stronger territory im a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different god knows we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas the main point about the movie i need to say is that it fails to say anything about mental illness or create a characters that you care aboutbr br this story has to be one of the weirdest things ive seen in yearsbut weird isnt enough theres no heart to the moviejust surrealism and confusion confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie the characters all try to make sense of their own problems but its chanwook park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all
