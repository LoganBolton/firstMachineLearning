chan wook park is nothing if not inventive im a cyborg but thats ok is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of marc caro and jeunet city of lost children delicatessen park embarks on a fanciful lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision it is genuinely unexpected then to see all parks effort add up to so very littlebr br im a cyborg but thats ok seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts the premise is promising gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience the characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast but try as i might i could not bring myself to care for anybr br sympathy for lady vengeance was a misstep indicating perhaps that park was overindulging himself a little bit but it still managed to showcase some of the directors unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography was readily forgiven none of the assured confidence that commanded joint security area or sympathy for mr vengeance is evident here im a cyborg but thats ok left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time more regularly as the film progressed i gave lady a 510 and by that measure this probably deserves no more than a 3 for old times sake ill be generous 410
