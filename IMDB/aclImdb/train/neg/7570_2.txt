you dont expect much from a prc picture and with rare exceptionsmainly from edgar g ulmer and a few by joseph h lewis or lew landersthats exactly what you get not much this epic about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isnt much different the script by longtime prc hacks arthur st claire and sherman lowe is trite laughable full of unfunny wisecracks and plot holes the size of outer mongolia the direction by longtime prc nobudget specialist al herman is semicomatose at best the performances thoughexcept for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf kingarent really half bad veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razorblade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up hes got great comic timing charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheikdespite his spanish accentand veteran bad guy george j lewis as renaldos arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch and she and renaldo have great chemistry together althoughlike the rest of the castshe has none at all with king hb warner whose career stretched back to the silent era lends a shred of dignity to the lowrent proceedings even though he blows his lines several times and prc being prc they werent cut out theres a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a bigbudget silent movie with a similar arab themealthough i have no idea which one it isand prc being prc no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous ive seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obviousbr br a yank in libya isnt very good of coursewell ok it stinksbut it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actordirector albert brooks and super dave osborne but had never actually seen him in anything before it was worth watching this tenthrate prc extravaganza just to see him in action otherwise forget it
