this was an awful movie basically jane march was a halfkorean north korean spy sent by kim jong il to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea she becomes a maid for an american military family they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white i believe the actress is either 14 or 18 southeast asian not at all korean and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her the way korea and the us military in korea is depicted is completely insane of course the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men whove never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either koreans or american gis and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie anyone whos ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage in the end the north korean honhyol spygirl gets killed in an obvious paying for her sins way very bad film with a madefortv feel to it
