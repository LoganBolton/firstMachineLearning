summer holiday is the forgotten musical version of eugene oneills ah wilderness and deservedly so with the broadway musical adaptation of take me along with the exception of the stanley steamer song none of the other harry warrenralph blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable br br it was right after the release of this film that mgm let mickey rooney go and i dont think it was a coincidence the film was made in 1946 and released in 1948 so mickey was 26 playing an andy hardy like teenager he was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellionbr br rooney made four films for mgm from 1946 to 1948 this one killer mccoy a remake of robert taylors a crowd roars love laughs at andy hardy and words and music in all of them rooney was playing an adult part even in the andy hardy film mickey played an adult andy hardy returned from world war ii why he was in this louis b mayer only knows br br rooneys bad casting makes summer holiday all the worse because in the original ah wilderness the emphasis is on the fathers character played here by walter huston and in the broadway show take me along which won a tony award for jackie gleason the great one played the inebriated brotherinlaw uncle sid here played by frank morgan and thats the central characterbr br gloria dehaven steps in for judy garland as rooneys sweet and adorable girl friend and marilyn maxwell plays the show girl who gives rooney an adult education in the original play oneill has her as a prostitute but this was the hollywood of the code so all marilyn does is get young rooney sousedbr br a lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best but summer holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn
