you just got to love opening sequences like the one in seven women for satan  during the intro theres a naked girl running through the woods chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how hes simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers oh im sorry i was lost in my thoughts he then says sweet i have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie even if you only understand a minimum of french and have a look at the original title you immediately know that seven women for satan hasnt got anything to do with satan or ritual sacrifices but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside this is in fact another sleazy variation on the classic milestone the most dangerous game about a lunatics disturbing hobby of hunting people  preferably hot naked chicks  in the forest for sports well actually this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic as writerdirectoractor michel lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to leslie banks legendary villain in the most dangerous game count zaroff supposedly is the original count zaroffs son but he exchanged his private island for the remote french countryside he also cant afford to be unemployed anymore so hes an office clerk from monday to friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones his butler once pledged to prevent the zaroffs from killing but hes obviously doing a lousy job there isnt any depth in the screenplay and the buildup certainly doesnt pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere really the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for zaroffs deceptive trap and hope theyll reach seven rapidly half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy  and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing i have the impression that it was michel lemoines intention to imitate his pal jean rollin and make a deliriously kinky sexthriller seven women for satan is a french production so inevitably it also stars jess franco regular howard vernon the awful dr orloff zombie lake lemoine himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer but not the talent to depict one
