this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and brightbr br is it educational no the doodlebops sing and thats it they usually sing about themselves they dont try teaching anythingbr br is it funny no the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at itbr br is it bright its so bright its painful as far as colors everything is extremely bright so thats good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebops therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sadbr br the show is also extremely cheesy every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny its overkillbr br for kids its entertaining but past the age of 2 you wont want your kids to see it theyll never know how to grow up
