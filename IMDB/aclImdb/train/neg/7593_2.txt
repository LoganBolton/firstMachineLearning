i dont like this film but then i didnt think much of the book either which although lauded by many as a masterpiece i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot although it was far more readable than fantes dreadful first effort road to los angeles not published until fante became fashionable in the mid 80sbr br i was intrigued to see what sort of soup towne would make with such meager ingredients he has worked hard scriptwise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didnt rescue it there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book i consider this film townes follybr br in a word forgettable
