given the history of the director of this movie it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there he was yet to see the movie and boy was he in for a surprise i have not read the book that this is based upon nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated but i have read captain correllis mandolin and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was i can only presume that something similar has happened here the acting wasnt bad albeit that there were a coupletoomany raised eyebrows from farrell honestly i cant believed how little i cared for any character in this movie situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness donald sutherlands part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door says something and closes it again i kept looking at my watch when i wasnt cringing at the dialogue on the screen i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this i gave this movie a score of 2 for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie the first is that i really enjoyed the alltooshort earthquake scene and the second is that salma hayek got naked and looked beautiful i can say little else positive about this movie dont ask the dust anything it cant talk
