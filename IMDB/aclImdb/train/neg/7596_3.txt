a film starring salma hayek and colin farrell two respected and talented actors sounds like a great idea an independent film sounds even better the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativitybr br but then why is this movie so bland ask the dustbr br this film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters no one is given a proper back story so we dont ever know why the characters act the way they dobr br explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have one left at the end of this moviebr br i told a friend that i went to see this film and that i thought it was awfulbr br her question not even colin farrell could save it my response not even colin farrells ass could save it
