i love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film i love salma hayek i was more than ready to love this picture but   br br booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo      br br no sir nothing good about this the only entertaining aspect for me was colin farrells character is an insecure writer and this screenplay despite tackling the juicy subject of racism approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc afterschool specialbr br the only person who didnt sound like he was acting was sutherland and his minutes were fewbr br stale approach to a tired plot
