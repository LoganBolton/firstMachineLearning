it must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film probably cruise the exec prod saw what was happening and had towne use much much more of the nude footage in the final cut then towne wanted to to make up for the disaster he saw loomingmaybe cruise even thought of titanica few items colin farrell cant act his way out of a paper bag but hes one of the flavorsofthedecade a producers darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films he has so many moments of not believing in what hes doing and you can see it in his eyes i think he would have been at his best as a film actor albeit not as rich or famous as he is now playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act the trap of spending a lot of money for period sets costumes cars et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car washwax no one seems to want anything to look well worn or dirty is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didnt ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined itemsbr br this was a story about the depressionthirties folks not a disney broadway musical about that era how about doing it in black and white or better yet given caleb deschanel as your dp have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times it should have been after all a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did in the depression more on farrell did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer hl mencken on the wall did i see his eyes roll at one point hayek and farrell as a sexually dynamic duo sending a boy to do a mans work perhaps in the book which i havent read the story was about an older woman and a youth i cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because i bailed out early on but the memory of the scenes i did see made me think that someone was doing a nottooamusing parody of a noir movie sort of what saturday night live has been like for the past decade not funny in my mind i kept thinking of a guy noir sketch music and all
