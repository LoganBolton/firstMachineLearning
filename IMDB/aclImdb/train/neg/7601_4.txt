this is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture arent enough to make a good film sure the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of los angeles in the thirtiesi especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram rising up the hillsidebut in a sense this fine cinematography is selfdefeating because it creates a mood that somethings going to happenand nothing does the script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or traumaand time after time not delivering not even delivering the i assume theme of the movie the characters essential misfit the lead actors both too pretty for their roles didnt convey any repression or agony and the script didnt expose us to anybr br now donald sutherland thats another story his character was so well fashioned so perfectly played that i wanted the camera to follow him
