i guess that gunslinger wasnt quite as godawful as most of the movies that mystery science theater 3000 shows but westerns just arent roger cormans forte portraying rose hood beverly garland becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies the movie is pretty predictable john ireland is roses new hubby secretly working for unctuous allison hayes yes the 50foot woman also appearing briefly is frequent corman costar dick miller as a mailman miller nowadays stars in joe dantes moviesbr br i do wish to assert that youll probably want to watch the mst3k version to really enjoy this movie they had a great time with it
