ill admit that i dont expect much from a roger corman film generally i expect a lot of walking and bad scripts yet in this case i am pleasantly surprisedbr br the gunslinger is a story of a woman played by the spunky beverly garland who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered ms garland is a pretty good shot herself killing one of the murderers the next day at her husbands funeral her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew the bars owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the hopedfor railroad however ms garland is a thorn in her plans and the bar matron hires a man to kill ms garlandbr br because of ms garlands plays her role honestly and realistically there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne somers shes the sheriff jokes with the exception of a couple of faux pas the apartment door that opens out from the inside jeep tracks and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare however corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes much like he does walking in other filmsbr br sterno says the gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time
