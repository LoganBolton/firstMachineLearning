being a big fan of cormans horror movies i expected from his western a bit more than i got well i was entertained all right i had almost as many laughs as watching mel brooks blazing saddlesbr br see the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west you can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on and the horses seem to have gears in them too considered the fastforward chases see also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920s here decades before the style was invented hope the saloon around them wont crumplebr br in the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job ireland garland and hayes are all truly fine a special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from johnny guitar but doesnt quite impress the same way but there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this just like a really bad old horror movie it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway that is one of the reasons cormans work appeals to me and that is why i dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance
