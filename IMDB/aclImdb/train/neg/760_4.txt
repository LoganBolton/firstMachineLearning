an uninspired and undistinguished new columbo which sees the maninthemac attend his nephews wedding only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night columbo investigatesbr br and that it is about it indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script given that it is written by robert van scoyk who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story murder under glass in the detectives heyday there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the scriptwriter is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding which include everybody who was therebr br devoid of every columbo trait possible i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues an insult to the history of the series with appropriately soapopera style acting very avoidable stuff
