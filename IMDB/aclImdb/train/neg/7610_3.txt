generally i dont like films directed by sydney pollack the firm being somewhat of an exception and ive never been a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has receivedbr br although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesnt seem to make any sensebr br the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway id much rather watch any of hitchcocks films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more
