1st watched 2282006  4 out of 10dirsydney pollackdvd version i watched titled 3 days of the condor so so cia drama full of laidback performances making for a very laidback movie the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert redfords character codename  condor being the one that was left who killed them and why thats what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time along the way he gets faye dunaways character involved involved originally because he needs a place to hide and then she eventually helps him out after a little loveydovey time this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesnt have a lot of suspense the flat performances dont help and the finish doesnt seal the deal for the audience enough either despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be
