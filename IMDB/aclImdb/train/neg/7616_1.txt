the good news is a movie was made drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztecamerican is such a word exists cast the bad news is it was dead at birthbr br if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic night of the living dead this is what we might have come up with the legend of diablo is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of mystery science theatre 3000br br i dont think one can even call this a b movie the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8mm film shot by a group of school kids br br some spoilersbr br the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community his daughters one hot and one homely team with a gringo fbi man and a priest to try to recage the demon br br meanwhile every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is reenactedpoorly these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead the supposed infrared scenes from the demons viewpoint are nothing special Â… and hesheit sure seems to back up a lot as opposed to turning around the moving forward and the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fastmotion is ludicrous it really really appears to be done for comic effectalthough i know it wasnt i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing  for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beachbr br of course the darth vaderfield of dreams voice calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical then again so was most of this cheese ball robert napton director and writer of the screenplay should win something for this effort how about a lifetime blackballing like the hollywood 10 this one i now see is rated 15 on a 10scale i fear this might be a tad generous br br is there anything good about this movie well lindsey lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff this is probably why her homely older sister calvi pabon really ran away from home fred estrado is reasonably decent as the fbi agent i wonder if mario soto who played father rodriguez is the same mario soto who pitched for the cincinnati reds if so he should have stuck to baseball in fact they couldnt have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it demons in the outfieldbr br if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class i will issue apologies it might be good enough for a b or even b as long as the gang got the colleges camcorder back to campus in one piece the blair witch project proved that a cool campy movie could be made on a shoestring the legend of diablo though didnt appear to have a shoestring or shoes to work from it was lowbudget lowtalent loweverything the very final sceneand i mean about the final 10 seconds of the filmis the only mildly creative or interesting momentbr br i paid 345 to rent this i could have better spent it on a hamburger
