as a mystery science theatre 3000 fan i can withstand any motion picture that can be foisted upon me but there is absolutely no reason for thisbr br rated super action in the blockbuster video section and given the dreaded restricted viewing sticker im assuming these are the only methods that film maker ha robert napton could use to get at least 450 from one unsuspecting personbr br shame on you robert napton shame on you for exploiting these poor mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in american cinema you are a disgracebr br there isnt one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action did you use snot on these people oh look theyre having a rave in a field like all 6 of them and isnt that an asian guy in the background why is it always daytime why did it take 12 of the movie to show anything and more importantly why did we watch the other 12br br ps you owe me 450
