i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen i read the comment from gumby8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew unless gumby8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at allbr br i couldnt believe gumby8s comments br br quoting from the dune inspired opening animation to the quick pacethis film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpectedbr br the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving well thats because you keep looking for any type of suspense i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of 10000000 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic as far as repeat viewing is not unexpected i think he made a typobr br another quote from gumby8 the only fan the acting is also a strong aspect of the filmbr br with all due respect for the actors their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert naptonbr br the catchy tagline beware the hour between dusk and darknessbr br thats because there is no dusk or darkness in this moviebr br mpaa rating rated r for some violencegorebr br the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see as far as i know it might be a clump of grassbr br in summation i have seen horror flicks from the 50s 60s and 70s i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good the director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction i would give this film a rating of 5 for a b movie
