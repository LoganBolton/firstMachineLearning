one can only assume that robert osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the tcm library as this would explain him extolling the virtues of this charming film during his introduction when i saw this on cable tv seeing as any old film on imdb receives classic status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers i thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this filmbr br this is not your fathers shop around the corner for all my quibbles with youve got mail it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable for those who have seen the original the flaws will only be all the more obviousbr br from one of the lamest meet cute sequences i can recall seeing a sad slapstick attempt at humor this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step this musical only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term there are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then theres judy singing i dont care while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure the christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical films but here she seems horribly miscast the role was originally to have been filled by june allyson and judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of margaret sullavans old part van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type the leads never achieve the chemistry of stewartsullavan or even that of hanksryanbr br this is a film that knows some of the notes but not the music it doesnt really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for van johnsons character to complicate things unnecessarily the remakes substitution for the originals infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin it is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of threes company by someone with a delorean and a flux capacitor its really just an excuse for a keaton pratfall even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled after seeing both films youll understand why they called it the lubitsch touch and not the robert z leonard touchbr br avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of judy garlands earlier films unless youre an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth
