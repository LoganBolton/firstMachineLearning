i gave this movie a very fair chance and it betrayed me this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich who did way better with targets gets great performances out of a ton of hams in their debuts lots of teenage sex clich√©s come out of this movie such as doing the teachers wife impotence doing the ugly prostitutewhich is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt not that things were really going anywhere anyway and skinny dippingbr br i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense to me it was just annoying i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess
