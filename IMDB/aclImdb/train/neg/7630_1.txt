a boring movie about a boring town in the 50s how can anyone think this is a classic the producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend cybil shepard into several movies that were way above her acting ability i think this movie gives an insight to how bad peter bogdonovitchs future movies were going to be cybil shepards career took a dive after being in several movies that peter bogdonovich produced it wasnt until moonlighting that her career started to come back i thought the acting was poor rendition of the graduate i have noticed that this movie hasnt been shown in the us the only place i have watched it was overseas in europe late at night
