its sort of hard for me to say it because i so greatly enjoyed both targets and paper moon but i thought the last picture show was a somewhat fascinating but overly selfindulgent film its main positive as far as im concerned is the stunning photography but for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty at that the characters were very hard to relate to or to care about basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama  everything from the boy cheating with his teachers wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on it was like american graffiti without the joy of lifebr br some might say this film is more realistic  nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess but for me the film was simply oppressive and i want to see it again about as badly as id like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live inbr br maybe this film really just belongs to its time  perhaps if id seen it in 1971 i would have been impressed by its novelty just by seeing something different on the screen but that would basically assume that i had never seen anything like say godards breathless maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the films weaknesses but in the posttarantino world that hardly seems unique or special eitherbr br it is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth we see 3 films as i recall in the picture show first we see vincente minnellis father of the bride  liz taylors exquisite looks provide a contrast to sonnys girlfriend and minnellis studied uppermiddle class milieu contrasts to the characters real life surroundings in a similar way later clips from howard hawks red river emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé it really just reminds me that bogdanovich is kissing his own mentors butt much as he did if i remember correctly by selecting a hawks film as part of his own onscreen reverie with boris karloff in targets i guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems selfindulgent like so much of the rest of this filmbr br ultimately id rather see another film by hawks ford or minnelli than to have bogdanovichs film remind us of why they were so striking in such a lessthansubtle way maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed  all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation
