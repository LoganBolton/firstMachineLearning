i so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypesbr br of course it went completely the other way  lets be cool and edgy  and came out the other side with little to show for it i bet one small seed went nuts for this i know sl didbr br none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off even danny k had better timing im actually being serious every time they introduced a bit character i kept thinking darn this person should have been the leadbr br independent doesnt mean that the camera work needs to be horrible black and white did nothing for this movie  actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief the black and white also wasnt crisp the composition was horrible the use of music was horrible strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb  maybe thats why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mindbr br i think corne who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything was speaking to this movie and not david  see it and youll understand i bet the guys who organise oppikoppi were dismayed one would think nothing happens there at all i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someones back garden i know regular guys who have much funnier raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these comics the dude who they hooked up with end was ok thoughbr br guess sa comedys gonna stay in the stone age a little longer nice work guys
