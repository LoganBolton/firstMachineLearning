i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and im sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame  but thats a minor issue the main issue i have with the actors isnt really their fault its whoever cast this film come on this movie came out in 2003 i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines from a grown man older than myself is im 17 how can anyone take that seriously dont fall victim to this movie go out for a walk for 90 minutes and youll get far more than this movie could ever give
