this is one of those movies thats trying to be moody and tense and instead ends up tripping all over itself having seen it at a queer film festival i was intrigued by the young college threesome gone wrong writeup however overall ended up quite disappointedbr br its hard to critique a true story since theres not much that can be done about the plot  but i found this disjointed melodramatic and wholly depressing its dark and almost sinister painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky closeups it just doesnt work  some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyesbr br the story has an interesting premise but this just spins downward into a dark miserable spiral
