its been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and im at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwoods a pregnant schwarzenegger br br one of the first scenes the one with the television show  where the hell are you got it right  the cast was 80 of lets face it  forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career relaunch then i think it might never happen with this on their cv the script had the potential but neither 80 of the actors nor the director whos an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the restbr br im sorry but if you ever consider watching this  i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only its a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like
