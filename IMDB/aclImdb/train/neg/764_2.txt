the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980s soap opera deeply characterdriven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the villains dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable selfeffacing crumpled self and the bridekidnap victim is a whimpering onedimensional damselindistress she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor  come on i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the youknowwhat in 2 seconds in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of realitythe story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours
