first off id like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10 then id give it a 4 its not that im a tough critic its just that this movie is that bad everything from the story to the directing to the editing is awful the story is not even halfway decent to begin with you cant expect much since it is based on a video game something i was not aware of going into the movie but the directing and editing made it even worse the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones some like a quick sex scene in the middle dont even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters dont show any feelings toward each other you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and youd still be disappointed honestly if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money and if you dont pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life so do yourself a favor and dont watch it
