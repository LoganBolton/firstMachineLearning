we should all congratulate uwe boll hes done the unthinkable he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on imdb hes like some kind of cinematic cockroach no matter how little talent he has and no matter how bad these movies are he manages to keep making them i know he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund but even so his ability to keep making movies despite absolute complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universebr br it wouldnt be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games even the latest one the new nightmare was good for a few hours of game play there was a good movie to be made out of edward carnbys adventures but this is not it now uwe boll has gotten his hands on bloodrayne and hunter the reckoning whats next silent hill doom i can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through gametomovie adaptations if hes not stopped someone needs to take away his line of credit or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise no one is interested in that title any morebr br think about it is house of the dead or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore no way a new house of the dead game comes out for xbox and nobodys gonna care the title is dead and all because of uwe boll so if any of you out there work for a game publisher or know a game publisher or have access to a game publisher please warn them br br this movie itself is not even worth reviewing i cant separate what i didnt like about this pile of dung from the rest of it literally everything about it sucks the writing the acting the music the cg effects the editing i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations i wouldnt be disappointed boy was i wrong never underestimate uwes ability to turn out a big steaming pile of boll sht
