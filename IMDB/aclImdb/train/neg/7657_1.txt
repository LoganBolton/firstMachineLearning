there should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like resident evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible re was a survival horror game and a damn effective one at that yet paul ws anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as resident evil so of course there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie instead alone in the dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming moviesbr br the plot despite the fact that it obviously isnt supposed to matter is the largest of many problems with the movie the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important as after a minute passes the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them then theres something about an orphanage some artefacts an ancient tribe some bureaucracy and some demons all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really cant follow with what is going on characters move in and out of the plot like candy some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths basically what i can understand is that some demons got released and edward carnby slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist reid who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason then out of nowhere all hell breaks loose and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander dorff who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnbybr br its all ridiculous and the reason i dont really understand it isnt just because its complicated and jumbled but it leaves no room for anyone to really care instead i highly recommend that if you must see this film bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusionbr br the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little right too bad this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens considering that this is based on a horror game not an action game it is especially annoyingbr br the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness and the rest isnt all that great either the demons look somewhat cool though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict its all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at nightbr br the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on the same is true of dorff who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot reid is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginningbr br in all this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies if they keep ruining the spirit like this its only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak47 and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens unlike resident evil however this one doesnt deserve a second chance as i dont think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is its bland uninteresting and unexciting this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea its all thrown together nothing really fits and in the end youre just glad its overbr br total 4
