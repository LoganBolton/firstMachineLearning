0s christian slater tara reid stephen dorff frank c turner mathew walker will sanderson directed by uwe bollbr br based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an actionpacked nail biter sadly he doesnt succeed instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line and some basic relativity of whats going on in the dark and the light the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters even though they did look cool and the feedings were well a little lame honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made my final rating 010
