this should be my kind of movie even if it sucked it still should have been right up my alley hell i like congo and allan quatermaine movies i have a soft spot in my heart for silly aliendemonadventure movies lets go over why i decided to watch this in the first placebr br 1 horrorscifi almost always intrigues me 2 im a big fan of archaeology and this movie does involve a rare treasure 3 supernatural enemies with quality fx 4 christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy 5 tara reid is hotbr br so this movie had potential at least in the cheesehorror section of the video store but boy did it suck ass the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i doi mean lets face it both are melodramatic but now on to some of the many faultsbr br tara reid even though the movie as a whole is worse reids performance is truly awful were not just talking bad im talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year i dont know if she is capable of acting but playing the museum curator is simply out of her leaguecompletely watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasnt much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn i mean this isnt just bad it is laughably bad oh and for those of you curious she doesnt get naked only down to a bra in a silly totally unnecessary love scenebr br even with reids performance perhaps the movie could have worked but the plot is what dominates and the plot seems written by a 10 year old i hadnt realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in realtime br br the storyline jumps back and forth from slaters childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened he has amnesia of course in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713 a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something slater had to leave because he was too rebellious i guess you never really know unless it was in one of those voiceovers i zoned out during the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities i may have the exact quote wrong but you get the ideabr br there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth no reason given experiments on children super demonalienhuman hybrids photonic bullets the demon things cant stand sunlight and of course slater and dorf to try to save everyonebr br jesus i cant even being to wade through the clich√©d elements the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth i mean why is this evil scientist so damn evil oh right humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race i guess hes infected how did that happen oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself how the hell did that happen why and where did he get the super slugs oh yes they use the old scifi stand by of parasitic aliensdemons which fuse with the spine of their hostof course slater is like blade half superslug powered but his slug didnt fully fuse due to an electrical shock thank god oh and the people with these fused spines have no idea theyre halfaliendemon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies yeah we get zombiesbr br so lots of crap that could be entertaining but none of it isbr br also the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first placeat least nothing a little dynamite cant handlebr br not the very worst thing youll see but a truly bad movie
