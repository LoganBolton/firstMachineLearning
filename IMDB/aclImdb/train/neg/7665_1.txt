honestly i cant be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence  life is simply too short what i will say is that alone in the dark succeeds in only three things 1 it will make you laugh but for all the wrong reasons 2 it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of thembr br andbr br 3 it utterly disgraces the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of filmmakingbr br doctor boll if that is indeed what you are im thinking proctology here what on earth are you doing in a directors chair
