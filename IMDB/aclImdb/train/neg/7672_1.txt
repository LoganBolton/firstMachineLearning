obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie so dont even look at the credits at the end youll only hold it against them nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie only 3 were in the theater two passed out after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones the monsters were the unemployed worm from star trek 2 the wrath of khan and rejected designs for the space creatures in alien the creators of the movie obviously didnt want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didnt get to memorize their lines or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening if anything is if you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing and you dont pass out youll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film the implausibility of several scenes will just stun you and stephen dorffs regular spewing of the queen mary of curse words conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this if you must see this movie do yourself a favor and wait until its in the bargain bin at the video store if theres any justice in the film industry one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you
