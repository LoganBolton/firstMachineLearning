i dont know where to begin tara reid needs to be stopped before shes put in another movie stephen dorff looks like he got his characters motivation from val kilmer in top gun slater sleepwalks through this dreck the direction editing sound do we really need a heavymetal video in the middle of a gunfight costumes bulletproof vests with muscles on them and hey theres no discernible plot either it amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said hey guys this just doesnt make any sense lets start over hopefully slaters career can rebound from this disasterbr br hands down the worst film ive ever seen
