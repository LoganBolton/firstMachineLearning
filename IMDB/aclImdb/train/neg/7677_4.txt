i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought analucia and libbys deaths were unnecessary and really depressing then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode gah i cant handle itbr br i liked this show for the first season but it definitely declined in the second season i found jack and lockes little religious feud to be annoying the deaths of rodriguez  watros characters was the final straw br br i give this episode a 410 for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend jj abrams i hope his series in the future will improve on this one
