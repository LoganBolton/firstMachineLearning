snow white which just came out in locarno where i had the chance to see it of course refers to the world famous fairy tale and it also refers to coke in the end real snow of the swiss alps plays its part as wellbr br thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film there is a lot of dope on scene and there is also a pale dark haired girl  with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescuebr br but its not a fairy tale its supposed to be a realistic drama located in zurich switzerland according to the taglinebr br technically the movie is close to perfect unfortunately a weak plot foreseeable dialogs a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting dont add up to create authenticity thus as a spectator i remained untouchedbr br and then there were the clich√©s which drove me crazy one by one snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter  of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were so busy all the time her best girlfriend on the other hand has loving and caring parents they a steelworker and a housewife live in a tiny flat poor and happy  and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in the good guy  prince is a musician  from the french speaking part of switzerland which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country he has problems with his parents they are migrants from spain who dont seem to accept his wild way of living  until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bedbr br and so it goes on naturally the drug dealer is brutal the bankers are heartless the club owner is a playboy and the photographer although a woman  has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a showbr br this review doesnt need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot as i like other films by samir eg forget baghdad i was quite disappointed lets hope for the next one
