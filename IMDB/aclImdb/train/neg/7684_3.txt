this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing just because youve got an excellent ensemble cast doesnt mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp think about itthe film featured richard widmark lauren bacall charles boyer gloria graham lillian gish and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film the basic premise of the film isnt bada private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients also the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife widmark and graham had a lot of promise however the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalowith bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film in fact it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of general hospital subtle this film aint realistic this film aint br br while most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script but i also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors for example paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talentespecially when playing gangsters in film noir movies yet here stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre european accentit just didnt work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and onedimensional also charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of america just seemed bizarrebr br overall this is a rather awful film it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isnt very pretty my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competentbr br psin a case of art imitating life oscar levant played one of the patients in real life the brilliant levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions
