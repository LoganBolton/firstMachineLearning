terrible film made on a budget of about 999 very obvious miniature sets used poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship the film contains some blood not enough to disturb and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands yes you read that correctlybr br one saving grace was a song performed at the talent show hows that for irony by a punknew wave band that i think was called im a heat seeking missile other than that this is not worth your time not even on a so bad its good level watch if you are into cheesy alien films but anyone else should steer clear br br rating 1 out of 10
