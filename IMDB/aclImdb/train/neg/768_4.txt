i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past and that is the disturbing point because columbo is no ordinary detectivebr br there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing first i cant figure out the title of this movie it is misleading maybe a better title wouldve been the vanishing bride or something similar second columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason to the viewers at least why he does itbr br i dont feel betrayed just disappointed im glad peter falk went back to the usual columbobr br
