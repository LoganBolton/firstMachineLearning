there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flicks abundance of clich√©s throughout  and i agree completely both with regard to the characters and the dialogbr br id read about elizabeth berklys awful performance in the equallyawful showgirls which ive never seen  and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of lifetimes worse fare there was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt have been if so it would have placed the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt a hint of depth or charisma  not a trace  in any one character performer or portrayalbr br the principals handling of lizs initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable her husbands initial reaction and advice were likewise forrest gump attacking jennys boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentallychallengedbr br the smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the professionbr br finally and frankly i rather enjoyed this part the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that youd rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community i know that most reallike cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the law and order series and the like  but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on lifetimebr br finally i found a kind of story within a story fascination with joshs concoction of his being the victim of his teacher this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story this was something of an achievement like going from f to fminusbr br this whole lame situation should have been resolved  in real life  in about 15 minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hours blank film in the camera br br but the writers here proved with their ending they could do even worse when the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemptionbr br this ones a 2 presentation the second  because it does have some mild fascination
