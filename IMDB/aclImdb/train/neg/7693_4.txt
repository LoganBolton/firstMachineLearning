is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable i think not basically the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing ever comes as a surprise it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension so for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama its a failure this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely i mean no way this could ever happen in real life as in the same way as the events occur in this movie so the movie has a real suspense and credibility problembr br but it truly are the clichés that killed the movie it was cringing stuff at times everything is so formulaic in this movie the predator is portrayed as a cool heartless almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman who acts like she didnt see any of this coming everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason such as the sequence in which the predator fixes the victims broken car that has got to be one of the oldest clichés out of the book i knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point i tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point the movie is filled with moments like thesebr br the title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for tv movie which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary subplots to make the movie even more drama likebr br ill admit that elizabeth berkley is pretty good acting in this movie she makes some of the clichés and events look even almost realistic at times her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie showgirls so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one its a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better all of the other characters are a disappointment corey sevier plays the cliché pretty untouchable rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence he wakes up he wants sex before he goes to sleep he wants sex he gets home he wants sex it might be a realistic thing but i dont know it just didnt feel right for a movie like this one and the story in generalbr br a cliché filled movie and i cant think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie its predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility not an horrible movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and cliché elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable onebr br 410
