unless youre twelve this movie really isnt worth it its obviously a lowbudget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work thats not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didnt know how bad though its bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wirefighting theres no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something its bearable but much better if youre say nine
