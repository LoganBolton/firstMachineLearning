this miniseries is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations sotd falls somewhere between kungfu and h r pufnstuff on the entertainment spectrum if it werent so long nearly 3 hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit its got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other icky stuff when youre young youre not too critical of flexing rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie just as was done in oldtime serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by nonasian actors br br i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it madebr br overall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the minivanbr br oh yeahhey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spellchecking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both websters and the oed consider it an alternative form
