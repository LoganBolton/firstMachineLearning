i saw this at the premiere in melbournebr br it is shallow twodimensional unaffecting and hard to believe given the subject matter boring the actors are passable but they didnt have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be overintellectualised you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards however it doesnt work as a popcorn film either its pacing is too offkilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actionerbr br i very much doubt gregor jordan could sit back and say to himself this is the best i could have done with the materialbr br ned kelly is a fascinating figure and equally so is the national response to him possibly folk genius possibly class warrior possibly psychopath and probably all these things he has dominated australian true mythology for over 120 years once again his story has failed miserably on the big screenbr br such is life
