im a black man living in a predominantly black city that being said i have some major misgivings about tyler perrys work i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him because hes black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture but i honestly do believe that were perry white this film would have had the naacp al sharpton and jessie jackson all over his assbr br i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil the characters are poorly written and acted the jokes are so bad i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny im just going to break this big pile of sht downbr br madeasuck the character may have had some appeal but it doesnt anymore when the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless she is unnecessarybr br the situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesht if a woman was so scared to death of her husband why would she try to run away when hes sleeping in bed wouldnt it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work at any rate the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didntbr br then there are the two lovebirds a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while hes making his rounds i couldnt believe it i really couldnt believe when she agreed to go out with him even more but what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch i dont use this term lightly but that woman only had two modes morose victim and psycho momma no matter which of these two faces she showed however there was one constant the bus driver wasnt going to get any he even married her without sampling the goodswtf br br then theres the family reunion scene here weve got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos grinding for the sake of grinding shirtless overly musclebound bball plus the great taste of maya angelou when those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack all this crap is going on at the reunion in laughably easy to separate groups and then they ring a bell when they do everyone drops what theyre doing and heads on over for a stern talking too just like a pack of pavlovs doggieswtf br br then you have the final five minutes of the film in it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress there is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceilingwtf the only reason to watch it this far besides testing your threshold for pain is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well guess what it doesnt happen instead perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe ending the movie on a tone of forgivenesswtf br br im pretty sure that if given a day  i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks dont even get me started on the rest of tyler perrys films im just going to say this in my opinion as a black guy dw griffiths legacy lives on the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did selling us down the river i only wish perrys films were dudes so i could kick them in the nuts thanks a lot dude what are you going to follow this up with in 2009 a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in colonial america
