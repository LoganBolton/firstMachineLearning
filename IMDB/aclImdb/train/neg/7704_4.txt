well theres no real plot to speak of its just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but its not in this case what else can i say about this the action when happening is inventive and theres a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper one that has to be several miles high but overall theres not much to recommend kite watch it if you want but youre not missing much if you skip this one
