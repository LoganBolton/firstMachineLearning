with a title like attack of the killer tomatoes anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a a bad science fiction movie or b a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies its supposed to be a mix of both with a dose of parody splashed in unfortunately it falls flat very soonbr br youre never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but youre supposed to think its funny right i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny ie the sidebyside phone conversations the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal superman walking by lois etc attack of the killer tomatoes strives to be a cult classic but it doesnt make it a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it or a similar description attack of the killer tomatoes could be enjoyed by any 8yearold with a bad sense of humor so therefore it does not qualify as a cult filmbr br there is one good actress in the entire thing sharon taylor as lois fairchild she is a thin gawky reporter but has an endearing personality loves to overact and is a natural comedienne unfortunately she is put to bad use herebr br attack of the killer tomatoes is not as funny as say amazon women on the moon or kentucky fried movie but it does have a few hilarious moments so i would still recommend seeing it once avoid the directors cut it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly lost footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect it can be found in english on the out of print tape
