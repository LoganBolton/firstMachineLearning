br br attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs the very meager story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly basicallythey spin and growl yesthey growl and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup the actors are nonames who never made movies after thisso there would be no point to name them theres a guy whos hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes hes accompanied by a black guy whos master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives anyway theres another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government if this isnt making much sense to you you understand this movie never would have been very good in the first place but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes the movie is horribly cheezy which although being the whole pointreally really hurts what couldve been a reasonably entertaining movie at one point a giant wax tomato slides on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it maybe i wouldve recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value but even this is lacking from this terrible movie 210
