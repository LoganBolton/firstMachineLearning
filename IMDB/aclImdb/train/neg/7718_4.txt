in case youre a selfacclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema andor bad moviemaking there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch attack of the killer tomatoes its an inescapable certainty as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made one tiny but essential detail however is that attack of the killer tomatoes is deliberately awful right from the opening message already mocking alfred hitchcocks the birds this is clearly intended as a zerobudgeted parody and i cant escape the impression that writerdirector john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of socalled ecohorror movies plants animals and nature in general revolting against humanity and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomatoattacks coming from all over the country the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices the first half hour of attack of the killer tomatoes is very entertaining as silly as it is the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song the jaws homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash see the trivia section for more details that made it to the final cut after that however the whole thing turns into a tedious unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots personally i prefer the late 80s and early 90s sequels which i saw before seeing the original because they benefit from slightly better production values incredibly overthetop tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin the addams family as the mad scientist dr gangreen but as said before already the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life
