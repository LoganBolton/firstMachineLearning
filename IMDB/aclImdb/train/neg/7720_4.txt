there arent enough gaythemed movies and there arent enough coming out movies every one is a welcome addition to the genre although the production values are highthe movie looks good matthias freihof philipp looks real good in a pair of jeans this is a bad one it is a period piece gay life under an oppressive regimeeast berlin 1989 a life that seems 40 years behind the west in a way were seeing our own history what it might have been like for gays in the 40s and 50s hereit often reminded me of last exit to brooklyn the book not the filmbut it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didnt hack at random yes it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes life behind the curtain was hard for gay people a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great comingout movies and not one of the misses
