well i couldnt even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values its a bmovie actionflick by the director of commando that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good bmovie with enough entertainment value in itbr br its an 90s flick but foremost the movie should remind of an 80s action movie when these type of bmovies were at an all time high these movies always went overthetop and never paid much attention to its story or acting it was all about blowing stuff up big muscle heroes and bullets flying around this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didnt liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies hard to say why really since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same erabr br its probably because the movie is being often far too silly all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it the fighting dolph lundgren running around shirtless the characters the story it all just isnt very good because its often just too lame for words the story at times isnt even trying to make a bit sense and whats even the main plotline of the overall movie its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences gun fights and such and those sequences arent even much good to watch really the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really from the man who brought us commandobr br its foremost a dolph lundgren in which he gets to play the big action hero star who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl played by tia carrere this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put togetherbr br none of the characters work out really the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest or to inform anyone about their discoveries not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of la and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling and also just think about it for a moment what is brandon lees overall purpose in the movie the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as wellbr br too silly lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enoughbr br 410
