seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrownin oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the oneliners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out its welcome as it turns into the worst action movie everbr br lungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van dammes movies seagals movies and stallones nonrocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carreres face when she is in any scene with dolph thats worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lees comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and lungrens performance is very jason voorheeslike in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a moviebr br the good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungrens sidekick and doing a really awful job at thatbr br an awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most nonunderwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fightsceneending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fillin between the flashes of nuditybr br a bad bad movie
