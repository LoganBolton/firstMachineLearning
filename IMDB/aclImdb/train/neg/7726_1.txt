 warning  this review contains plot spoilers though nothing could spoil this movie any more than it already is it really is that bad br br before i begin id like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those soincrediblybadthatyoufalloverlaughing movies if youre in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh this is the movie for you now without further ado my reviewbr br this movie was found in a bargain bin at walmart that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is secondly it stars the lame actionstar dolph lundgren that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is im still shocked that it was even put on dvd who would waste their money doing such a thing though as you might imagine there arent any extras or bonus footage on the dvd in fact theres not even a menu the movie just starts playingbr br first the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible oneliners remarkably unbelievable fake dialogue and inappropriate comments like lees comment on lundgrens err manhood which ill mention later there isnt one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie the dialogue and plot go handinhand as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning and then for again no reason at all lees character pulls over to the side of the road runs around to the other side of the car and says im not going to let you go alone cause despite myself i like you and i dont want to see you get killed  or something to that extent anyhow there are disgusting oneliners mostly said by lee for instance when duking it out with a bad guy lee says you have the right to remain silent  you have the right to be dead lastly ill mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about lundgrens netherregions when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and carrere and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear lee says to him incase we die i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick ive ever seen on a guy  yes he actually says that it makes no sense and isnt even possible lee never actually sees lundgren naked so how would he know but the writer threw it in the script anyway the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game and lee even admits it after lee and the underwearonly lundgren defeat all of those bad guys lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful wow this is sort of like a video game we just defeated the first wavebr br second the plot of this movie is despicable it suffers in my opinion mainly from the fact that it just doesnt exist the trailer for this movie  which imdb has available for viewing by the way  makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese yakuza from taking over lost angeles this is extremely misleading however since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all they make very brief vague references to the yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorlywritten attempt for kenner lundgrens character to revenge the death of his parents whom the yakuza leader named yoshida killed when he was only 9 years old the entire plot can basically be summed up like this yoshida wants kenner dead kenner wants yoshida dead and the two try two kill each other and of course all the while kenners sarcastic sidekick named johnny and played by brandon lee acts like an ignorant idiot and tia carrere gets naked twicebr br the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie the dialogue is so unrealistic and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more youd expect poor acting from action stars anyway but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recordedbr br finally we get to the heart of the movies baseness the flagrantly bad action there are so many astoundingly bad unrealistic action sequences in this movie its just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren for instance lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys onehanded without spilling his tea then when surprised by an oncoming speeding car lundgren casually leaps over it or how about when he reaches through a closed door grabs the villain on the other side pulls him back through the door and beats him up or when he picks up tia carrere gently walks not runs backward through a glass door that shatters around him and leaps down a onestory height with tia still in arm only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets all of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy instantaneously while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them that is of course until the final fight scene of the movie lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds despite this lundgren remains in topnotch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with yoshida the evil super villain and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real fully sharpened katanas which the two use to sword fight now in addition to his bullet wound lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms does this stop him no of course not in fact a few seconds later after easily killing the evil yoshida who gets pinned to a dartboardlike wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason lundgren casually walks off with tia and lee as if he wasnt injured at all god its terriblebr br all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary gratuitous nude scene every five minutes including topless women at a party the beheading of a topless woman women at a strip club nude women at a japanese spa and the pointless hot tub and love scene with tia not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar at which rich japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women which by the way prompts lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and lundgren will go eat fish off those naked chicks which of course is followed by a disturbing high five and we cant forget the terrible editing either like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers which implies that a lot of the action probably wasnt done by the movie stars after allbr br in the end this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness it is illogical and impossible and as a result remarkably entertaining if youre looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema this movie will make you want to die if youre looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making this movie will delight you as an actual movie ill merit this movie a 05 out of 10 as an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes however this beauty takes the cake
