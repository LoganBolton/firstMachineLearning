this mini does not get better with age i saw this and its sequel when originally broadcast and like so many others was blown away in early 2002 i borrowed the novels for both wow and w and r and was even more impressed i then decided that i had to see both again and invested 200 plus on the dvd sets i watched both minis again in painful detail and realized i had done things backwards  i should have purchased the novels and borrowed the dvdsbr br dont believe it is abysmally miscast read the novels and see for yourself dont think this is dated screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get warning  reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughsbr br according to the trivia section for this mini  dan curtis himself chose ali macgraw and robert mitchum yikes production quality music scoring dialog  a great story was turned into a late 70s soap opera by an overly ambitious producerdirector who was in way over his head this thing was dated the minute it was completedbr br these two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days imo  this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints
