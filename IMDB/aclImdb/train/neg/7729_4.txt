a wonderful television miniseries completely ruined by a 45year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16year old ingenue no exaggeration  thats the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor this tv miniseries really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes upbr br that alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact its one of the best filmed wwii global dramas tv has ever produced if you have the stomach  or a decent fastforward ability  you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance br br im stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story pun intended did they watch the film with their eyes closed or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their selective memories and selective vision im a boomer myself so dont think for a second im some hubristic young punk 45 will always look 45 get used to it deal with it age gracefully damnitbr br the winds of war could have been so good how much more would we be talking about this miniseries today some 25 years later had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important  critical role right now with the constant haggard old biddy distraction that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war
