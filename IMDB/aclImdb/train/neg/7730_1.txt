despite much style flash and glitter this french musical fails to speak the tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious the story is uninteresting as are the many characters br br people break into song and dance without motivation or reason most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces and the sets look hopelessly studio boundbr br to be honest this video of the restored version was stopped before the end so negative an effect it had on me certainly a shame to have such a multitalented cast in so feeble a final effort br br goes to show i guess where followups in this case to the great classic umbrellas often do go awry one cannot recapture only recreate
