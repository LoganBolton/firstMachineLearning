the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cutandpaste musical in the american style  awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable songanddance numbers gene kellys french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as youll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this cant be attributed to demy the film also has several selfaware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to legrand himself and the costumes  well the tight pantswhite boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film   br br but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas note for instance the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort  this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg also note the convenient brunette of resolution  madeleine in umbrellas and josette in young girlsbr br generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrellas script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin 60s american musical will be quite happy
