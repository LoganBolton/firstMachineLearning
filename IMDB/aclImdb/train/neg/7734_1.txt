this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak  i couldnt even follow it the acting is highschoolish the sound track is irritating the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible the credits are even slow  i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film dont waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting
