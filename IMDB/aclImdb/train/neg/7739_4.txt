remember when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood because he made great movies those days are feeling like a more and more distant memorybr br while hollywood homicide is by no means terrible it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie its a comedy thats not particularly funny and an action movie thats not especially exciting an overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storylinebr br ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects and he is able to carry the film most of the time hartnett is adequate but he and ford arent exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concernedbr br all in all hollywood homicide is a reasonably amusing diversion but just barely take out ford and its not even that
