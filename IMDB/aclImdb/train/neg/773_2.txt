no not the administration of gwb the deciderstruttersmirkerbut the miniseries monarch cove lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time most of them broadcast between 11 pm friday nights and 1 am saturday mornings as to why i watched the whole thing i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochismbr br most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward who turn in the only decent performances jones doesnt make it through the entire serieslucky woman ward by the way is aging quite well since her thorn birds daysbr br the one main thread to the plotwho murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dads murder but is freed after six years in the slammeris stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you wont especially care who dun it there is a great deal of steamy sex several murders and all sorts of rude behaviorvirtually none of which is either interesting or credible most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented the writing and direction is on a par with the castbr br if you stick around to the end the post card is a very minorhootbr br consider yourself warned
