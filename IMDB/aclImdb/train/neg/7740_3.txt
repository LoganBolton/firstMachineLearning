this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 23 of the journey sadly the film ends up being too confused while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of buddy cop films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interestbr br the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickeringbr br in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what couldve been an enjoyable piece of escapism heres whats concerning joe gavilan harrison ford at the end of the filmbr br 1 his real estate deals 2 his affair with a radio psychic 3 hes being investigated by internal affairs 4 the homicide investigationbr br if you add in caseys concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his fathers death now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen the impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmakingbr br as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasnt bad enough one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour wasnt bad enough joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun all these extracurricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plotlines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehensionbr br while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story i wont this couldve been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettablebr br while this will probably be better than the likes of the hulk and lara croft ii that still doesnt make this film good i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money im not sure if thats true or not what is true is that to get great box office you dont need a great movie or a great actor this film has neither in its lead roles my advice to harrison ford would be to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run
