josh hartnetts dead eyes the thick writing of it and harrison ford being in a buddycop comedy  heres 3 reasons to hate it avoid it and to utilize 116 minutes of your life betterbr br the buddycop movies are fun however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than hollywood homicidebr br what really did happen to this entertaining formula  since a whole decade the things hadnt been the same youd have a buddyaction stubborn flop after another ill delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well  i spy  2002 national security  2003 taxi  2004 starsky  hutch  2004 and the worst of them all yet miami vice  2006  br br i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already add to that particularly here the negligent dealing and the dull humor actually the matter this time is totally unbearable yes weve got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs and the background of sinful city but what else was new  its not about cliché its about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly madebr br the acting especially from hartnetts side is terrible this guy is anything but a comedian or actor  so his character was wanting to revenge for his fathers death  revenge on yourself man he probably died out of watching your acting  even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy or thats what they seemed here anyhow br br the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh some parts managed to be highly dull arresting the black guy through the lack   its a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be actioncomedy  they didnt utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm or even as a place whichs full of shining or fallen stars cameos that couldve given it few interesting momentsbr br its a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars glamour and as being a buddycop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with nonchemistry on the screen one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself  guess who  and a buddycop destroyer more than movie  god dont make me or my children live enough to witness hollywood homicide  part 2  at last look at harrison fords performance he wanted to have a good time but at least we didnt
