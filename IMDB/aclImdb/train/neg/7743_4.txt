this film was one of the worst ive seen in a long while br br its a combination police drama and comedy about two hollywood detectives harrison ford and josh hartnett investigating a shootout at a hip hop club br br the plot is contrived and there are way too many side issues going on ford is hustling real estate on the side martin landau is one of his clients hartnett runs a yoga school where hes hustling chicks in his spare time the two are under investigation by internal affairs ford is screwing the exgirlfriend lena olin of the ia investigator and shes a psychic who has a radio show the man who set up the killing at the club is a dirty excop who shot hartnetts father years agobr br toss in the obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor and thats about the gist of this turkey
