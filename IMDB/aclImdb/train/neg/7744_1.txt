well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people it is patently awful nothing makes sense in this movie there is way too many subplots for a start josh hartnetts character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo harrison fords character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigators exwife who happens to run a psychic radio show which fords character calls from time to time nonsensebr br i cant remember the characters names thats how forgettable this is so ill refer to them as ford and hartnettbr br then theres the dialogue which is brutal i mean cringeinducing stuff here throw in every cliché in the book having a hearttoheart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name the duo being investigated by internal affairs why hartnett confronting his dads killer and youve got one hell of a messbr br as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is nonexistent 1 when fords car is being repossessed how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked were they following him 2 when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene an earring is replicated on of the charred bodies there that was lucky 3 when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning  ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett centers himself with a yoga pose on the table instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him then inexplicably the two are released without answering any questions 4 during the car chase hartnetts car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again not a scratch 5 when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at 6 when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnetts car ford is trying to close a real estate deal come on 7 the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label they might leave his label and its a warning to keep his other groups loyal but hang on how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan 8 why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end there is no explication 9 and hartnett gets to use his acting to capture the bad guy in the endbr br i could go on i really could anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because thats all it is theres nothing else to it its not supposed to be satirical or ironic its just crap
