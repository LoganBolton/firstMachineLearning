first the cgi in this movie was horrible i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel at the end when the owner of the park gets killed its probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen even night of the living dead had better animationbr br that said the movie had almost no plot why were they on that island in particular well it wasnt stated in the movie and why would the people keep coming into the cats area makes no sensebr br one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting in what could be called a b made for tv movie movie the acting was very good parry shen stood out in particularbr br if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday watch this movie it may be good for some memorable quotes
