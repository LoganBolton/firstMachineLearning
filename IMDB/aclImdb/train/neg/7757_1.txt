i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too if youre gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the fx to back it up also dont get a bunch of z list actors to play in it another thing just about all of us have seen jurassic park so dont blatantly copy it all in all this movie sucked fx sucked acting sucked story unoriginal lets talk about the acting for just a second the carradine guy whos career peaked in 1984 when he did revenge of the nerds which was actually a great comedy hes not exactly z list he can act he just should have said no to this st bag he should have did what mark hamill did after return of the jedi and go quietly into the night he made his mark as a nerd and that should have been that i understand he has bills to pay but that hardly excuses this st bag have i called this movie that yet ok i just wanted to be sure if i sound a little hostile i apologize i just wasted 2hrs of my life i could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel and i feel cheated ill close on that note thank you for your time
