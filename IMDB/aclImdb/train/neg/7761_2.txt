after a series of poweroutages on a remote island zoo genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island man the scifi channel has made some bad original movies but i think this might possibly be their worst so far this badly written and directed jurassic park ripoff offers all the usual clichés mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are expendable losses characters walking down long dark hallways alone braindead teen characters whos only function in the film is to die a horrible death etc and unsurprisingly no suspense whatsoever the special effects are atrociousthe puppet heads in closeups of the title beasties are bad enough looking like stiff plush dolls but the cgiwhich makes the computergenerated dinosaurs in walking with dinosaurs look lifelike by comparisonare just downright awful theres some gore but most of it looks pretty unconvincing oh and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things ive seen in years i couldnt even laugh it was so badbr br dont waste your time this one is just downright badbr br 210 br br oh and heres some interesting trivia for youthis film borrowed music cues from the 2003 scifi film alien hunter which was far superior to this piece of crap
