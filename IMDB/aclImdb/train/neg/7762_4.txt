considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xys creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcells performance because i found he didnt make a believable john doe an other problem was the police story it really felt like déjà vu and it wasnt a pleasant sensation it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch the episodic format i could already see the fillers coming one after an otherbr br so overall i was very disappointed by it and dont recommend it to anyone considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled in some way i have the impression that it missed its target developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity its sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct but ill never know if it got better probably not because i dont plan to watch the next episode
