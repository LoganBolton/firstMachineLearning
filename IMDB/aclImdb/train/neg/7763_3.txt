my giving this a score of 3 is not what i would give the original soviet version of this film it seems that americaninternational a studio that specialized in ultralowbudget fare in the 60s bought this film and utterly destroyed itslicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film plus much of this 64 minutes was new material such as the monstersso you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original the original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the soviet conquest of spacethough i really am not sure what it was originally for insight into the original film read steven nylands reviewit was very helpfulbr br by the way this was the third soviet scifilm ive seen that americaninternational bought and then hacked apart to make a new filmstandard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buckprovided of course it didnt cost them much more than a buck in the first place this americanized film was about two rival world powers not the us and soviets trying to be the first to mars the tricky bad guys try but fail and the good guys rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to mars unfortunately they are temporarily stranded on a moon of mars where they see some monsters added by americaninternational that are reaaaally cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a females anatomy then they are rescuedreturning to earth heroesbr br the bottom line is that the film was butcheredturning an incredibly beautiful piece of art for the time being turned into a gradec movie because of this the soviets really had a reason to hate america im just shocked that the horrible job ai did with this film didnt convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks its worth a look for a laugh but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between so the film is a dudnot bad enough to make it a mustsee for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously i would really love to see this movie in its original formit must have been some picture
