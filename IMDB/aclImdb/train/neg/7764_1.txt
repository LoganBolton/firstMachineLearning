what is this  a low budget sex comedy  anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s and people like them  this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one you cant let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing hell never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people 35 seem to laugh watching s im truly disappointed maybe i dont like gays which is quite an important part of the moviebr br foreign humor is awful in films except kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
