strange almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie is it because its from 1975 and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling br br maybe its because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book i have not read the book but i dont think thats a problem film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book br br or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that englishspeaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts
