to anyone not familiar with cs forresters book this film should be interesting it is colorful well acted and depicts high adventure but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling i could hardly sit through itbr br for some reason screenwriters seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on of course the spoken word is different from the written word and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film but why do the screenwriters rewrite the story instead of just adapting it in this case the writers outdid themselvesbr br just a few examples there was no mutiny on the renown the officers did take over the ship after the halfinsane captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway for reasons implied but never given there was no court martial the court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere captain pellew does not appear appear in this part of the hornblower saga nor does col ortegas wife hornblower himself was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore there are plenty of such manipulations of forresters storybr br on a purely technical basis i think the films repeated use of the flashback device hurts the continuity of the storybr br why oh why did screenwriters have to mess up a good story
