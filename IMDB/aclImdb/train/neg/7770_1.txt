this complete mess of a movie was directed by bill rebane the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anticlassic monster ago go as i was nearing the end of the cold i came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60s shocker the story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win 1000000 its a very simple plot but rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible things happen characters are completely forgotten about nothing makes too much sense and then it ends weirdly i mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly i guess you are left to draw your own conclusions production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard in truth pamela rohleder shelly isnt even that good she is so unbelievably terrible shes compelling sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crapfest as a whole its just a bargain basement rotter
