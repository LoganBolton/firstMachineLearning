am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on showtime the film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography but the screenplay was stilted and wooden the acting was fairly bad thought the two female leads were serviceable you never really believed anything the supporting actors said though there were the stereotypes biblethumping reverend without a hint of nuance authoritative captain hotheaded soldier etc i am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies i clocked it straight away as canadian without knowing it to be suchthe telefilm canada end credits gave it away i know im a horrible personbr br maybe i missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason focus people theres a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbiansthats just my inference for the hostility directed towards them if they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them the question of their immortal soul can be resolved laterbr br also i guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy these girls are supposed to be the protagonists one of them murdered the indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives i guess one is just a victim of her condition who cant be necessarily blamed for her actions but the other is just a murderer who doesnt deserve her happy ending
