what a load of rubbish i cant even begin to describe how awful this film was the rating it has here is really hard to believebr br avoid particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps the first one was well written well directed well executed a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere the second one was alrite decent as a selfstanding film but clearly not up to the level of the first the third is an insult to the series period i rate the films 10 6 1 its that badbr br oh and yes it really is set in the past the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald all muddled in with some halfassed native american mythology the sisters dont have any real story or progression or even a clear relationship theyre just trying to survive and be together forever thats about as deep as it getsbr br staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pileofshite after reading the scriptbr br oh and another thing staging of action was terrible people appearing from nowhere regularly like the girls turn around and theres an elaborate candlelit setup with a mystic native american woman just sitting there about to go into a speech sets were terrible couldnt get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set which really didnt help also there was consistently snow outside the camp but not a trace inside on the setbr br arrghh so bad i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one
