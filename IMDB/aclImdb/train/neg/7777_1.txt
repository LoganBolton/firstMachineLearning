this could be a cute movie for kids my grandson watched it once he was watching it a second time i was watching some of it with himbr br when the little bear gets lost on the ice burg and he is in the water he is trying to get to a piece of ice it says come back stupid ass foolbr br i dont want my 3 year old grandson watching movies with words like this in itbr br that is why its rated for children should be child friendly that is what i would expect put out by warner brothers and g rated i would expect this to not have cuss words in it the words dont even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later and the movie drags out in many parts
