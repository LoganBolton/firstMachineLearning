i could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd but i decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe something would happen this is the work of a writerproducerdirectorspecial fx kenneth herts who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie thats what he wanted anyway what it turns out to be is a lot of acting either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster attacks in the river waters oh and what luck a woman just happens to be naked in it even though there have already been disappearances br br this is just nonsensical stuff but i suppose its not too harmful its not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semiinteresting peek at brazilian culture which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of hey this is not america but whatever hope the director had in casting mitchum or carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog it doesnt help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the action happens it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s but with monstroid or monster or whatever its called nahbr br if you happen to get the elvira dvd doublefeature of this bad print with bad transfer quality with blue sunshine make sure to skip this one unless of course youre an elvira diehard and cant help yourself to hear her luscious commentary personally id rather get joel or mike nelson with the robots from mystery science theater on this roast turkey
