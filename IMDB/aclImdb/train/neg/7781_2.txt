tough guys sexy women lots of swearing and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake youd think monster would be funbut it isnt really it does star tony eisley and john carradine however and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once in an interview with fangoria in 1987 eisley recalled that herbert strock had directed the bulk of the film but somehow kenneth hartfordwho only directed the footage featuring his children andrea and glenn portraying characters named andrea and glenn in a particularly inventive turnreceived full credit considering how awful the end result was strock was probably glad that he hadnt been credited monster has the look and feel of a midtolateseventies tv movie which is why i like to leave it on in the background every so often as entertainment it falls flat on its face but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of filmmaking its very effective the only thing thats missing is a car chase
