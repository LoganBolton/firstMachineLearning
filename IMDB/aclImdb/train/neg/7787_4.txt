this is one of those films thats more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective i do my ratings based on how much i enjoyed or was entertained by the movie so im giving it a 4 if i were to rate it as an academic film though it would get a 10br br it is shot in a very interesting manner like a pseudosilent film with elements of sound effect and reality its meant to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind and it is interesting in these respectsbr br however the film has a lot of disgusting elements to it that i didnt find all that entertaining theyre mainly just disturbing it has some very interesting imagery too and some interesting concepts but some of the character relationships especially between the mother and son are pretty disturbingbr br in all this film will either appeal to you or it wont for me it was interesting from an academic perspective but it wasnt a good watch and ill probably not go back to it a second timebr br 410 if youre looking for entertainment 1010 from an academic standpoint
