ive noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how wholesome and entertaining it is these people need to get out of the house more often i dont know why theyre shilling for this vapid insipid brainless piece of fluff pat boone has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his costar pamela austin a former model yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day a good supporting cast terrythomas edward everett hortyon among others tries hard to make some sense out of this but to no avail i noticed that two directors shared credit although credit isnt the word i would use neither is director as for wholesome entertainment there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this find one of those films and skip this one
