like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film i was also waxing nostalgic about itbefore i had the misfortune to actually watch it again alas my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy and the perils of pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal racist and plain boring filmmaking even the presence of old pros edward everett horton and terrythomas cant overcome a rancid screenplay a horrible theme song and some wretched special effects in addition the stereotypical depictions of african and arab characters make for painful viewing especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement michael weldons original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that the perils of pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release judging from the results that is a completely believable and baffling scenario
