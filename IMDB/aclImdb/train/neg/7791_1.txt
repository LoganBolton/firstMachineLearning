ive seen the original nondubbed german version and i was surprised how bad this movie actually is thinking i had seen my share of bad movies like ghoulies 2 rabid grannies zombie lake and such nothing couldve prepared me for this it really was a pain to sit through this flick as theres no plot no good acting and even the special effects arent convincing especially the socalled zombies wearing nothing more than white makeup and their old clothes so their good set wouldnt be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains br br if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life then watch it for all the others dont do it because you will regret it
