this is one of the worst movies ive ever encountered but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarrantedbr br as far as pure filmmaking technique goes this director is competent hes held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera but the actual editing camera angles camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional ive seen many movies where the directing was much worse at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there also the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go as far as artistic merit there is none the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film this is pure trash total garbagebr br the gore is decent for a film in this budget range  its obviously fake but theres lots of it and its very outlandishbr br i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing this was a good idea and its the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film unfortunately its overdone especially towards the endbr br its really a terrible film but i have to recommend it for its camp value its really hard to find a movie thats worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category
