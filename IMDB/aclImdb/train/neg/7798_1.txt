this review is based on the dubbed shockorama video released on an undeserving world in 2002 how bad is it its awful which is what a 1 represents on the imdb scalebut its much worse than that its nice to imagine that an original germanlanguage print might improve mattersthe comedic englishlanguage dubbing isnt funny at allbut truthfully this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre youre likely to see the zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever and they dont seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal however theyre also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation george romeros land of the dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence here zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director andreas schnaas utterly without redeeming social value and even worse entirely lacking as entertainment zombie 90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it
