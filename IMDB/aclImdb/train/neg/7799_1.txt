what in gods name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies was zombie 90 ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here br br zombie 90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas who specializes in earthshattering gore films such as goblet of gore and anthropophagus 2000 and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isnt much different than the rest although the level of ineptness well earthshatteringbr br zombie 90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jacksons deadalive is gory think about itbr br getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a zgrade nightmare i cant tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shotonvideo introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longerbr br ive seen only one film that was worse than this the chooperbr br for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme pestilence a try but youve been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all youre here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride schnaas 110 br br updated 7509 after a few more viewings of zombie 90 ive had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie 90 is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star
