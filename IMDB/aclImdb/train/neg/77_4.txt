i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalbr br guess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang 410
