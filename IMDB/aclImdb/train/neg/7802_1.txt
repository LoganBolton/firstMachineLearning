a chemical spill is turning people into zombies its up to two doctors to survive the epidemic its an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word crap wouldnt fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is but i dont know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in summation this movie sucks balls dont watch itbr br my grade f
