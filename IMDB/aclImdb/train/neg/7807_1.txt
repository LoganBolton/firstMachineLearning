i picked this dvd up at the dollar store the dvd was on the 2 for 1 rack but since it had michael madsen in it i thought that since i had never seen the movie i bought it anywaybr br i must say that i didnt like the movie the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else i found that the directors use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological orderbr br i wont throw it away like one of the other commentators but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie againbr br who knows since it was michael madsens film debut maybe it might have some archival value at some future date
