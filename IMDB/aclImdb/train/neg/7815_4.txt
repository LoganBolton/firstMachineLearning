as a longtime fan of superman from the comics through the 1950s series the first two of the chris reeves films and lois  clark and finally smallville i was really hoping for something clever with superman returnsbr br instead we got lex luthor making another attempt at realestate conversion another supermanbeatenupwhilewearingkryptonite sequence and internal inconsistencies he couldnt stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 of kryptonite but when lois breaks off 3 of it leaving the rest embedded in him he can lift a continent into space really the only hero in the story was lois partner  i cant remember his name offhand he did all kinds of lifesaving heroic things with nothing but guts and skill  no superpowers no invulnerabilityjust a normal humanbr br they keep making superman so small why cant we have superman battling brainiac or fighting to save the universe from general zod instead of lexs petty schemes oh i forgottheyre doing that in smallvillebr br yeahi think ill stick to smallvillebr br you probably should too
