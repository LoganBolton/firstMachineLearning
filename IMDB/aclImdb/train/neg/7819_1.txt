this would be the worst film id ever seen hmmm ok maybe tied with boogeyman then awful truly awfulbr br i had low expectations and it failed to meet them i honestly cant think of one good thing so here are the worst pointsbr br 1 the acting 2 the plot 3 the cgi xbox 360 has better graphicsseriously 4 the plot 5 the dialogue and finally 6 the plot br br there are so many unanswered questions did they make a 232 hour long movie then realize they hadnt put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think noone would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than supermans son and the henchman he killsbr br was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do itbr br when superman goes to hospital why dont the doctors ask what the f do you want us to do hes a fing alien we dont know jack about his anatomy br br what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years br br where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same moviebr br and finally why just why br br btw for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite i think ive figured it outbr br since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks it is clearly all in his head therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rockbr br either that or the writers are slackjawed halfwits who didnt think that was a fairly obvious mistake
