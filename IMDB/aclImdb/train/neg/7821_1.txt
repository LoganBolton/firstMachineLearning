did the moviemakers even preview this before they released it the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation the beginning doesnt clarify if its a prequel or not it starts with supermans beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie  but doesnt really alert the viewer of this very confusing superman himself is weak and in need of prozac he is portrayed as a potential homewrecker a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero the ending is absolutely ridiculous superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself im seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says the results are in  in the case of the child superman you are the father to sum up  ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey but horrible script the movie is basically unwatchable
