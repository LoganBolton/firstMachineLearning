this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological i stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes  eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them i mean how could the movie really be bad nobodyll admit it its a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner but the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what im writing right now i actually plagiarized their facesbr br obviously lois is only aroused by power she wont even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesnt stop jet liners it cant be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that in the old supermans she had some level of connection with him he wasnt priority number 1 obviously but it strengthened her character that she was torn i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kentbr br and now its official kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg personbr br superman one he loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way hes human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to highschool students he relates to people who feel different he relates the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems hes just doing a job when hes saving peoplebr br theres something about clark that lois likes shes really internally in love with him but cant admit it and when he comes into the picture as superman it throws a kink in the ontherocks love without superman she wouldve fallen in love with clark at least thats what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois literallybr br superman two i just watched it again as a kid i thought i enjoyed the action but now i know it was the story that held me then too watching it over and over again if i saw superman returns as a child i wouldve hated it then too i thinkbr br there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie its sick superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile meanwhile lex luthers got something fantastic up his sleevebr br superman three now theres a threeway love story between superman and lana and clark only humanity wins and clarks inner nature beats supermans power because when his supermoral nature is gone and hes superhuman who does human things with his superpowers she sees its not the power of superman that shes in love with its not superpowerman but supermortalman that she loves  and whos really super and when she tells clark she prefers him to superman he is elated he has made a human connection again he wants to be accepted for who he is not just for his ability to bend steel this is the kind of stuff thats missing from superman returnsbr br clark supersneezes to help the kid get a strike  humanity again plus its an ineresting use of superpowers hes not just using straight brute strengthbr br he crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for savingbr br it seems theres nothing at stake in superman returns even in superman three we see the damages caused by the nemesis world domination plot we see suffering we see how it effects pryor and others and people in the middle of it theres no damage esp emotional from lexs plot to sink the us we see a glob of crystal thrown into space superman had to get very creative in the first three supermans in order to stop the plot against him he couldnt just access his superpowers in the first one he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save lois life this was thirty years ago in the second one he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more powerful than but combined with lexs genius and the villains immoral tactics supermans overpowering wasnt enough he had to work one against the other and outsmart them in superman iii again his superpowers werent enough to win he had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw he couldnt use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression and he found that acid earlier when he couldnt simply use his superpowers to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his superbrains  he couldnt carry water so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire now in superman returns he simply lunges the island into outerspace like a night temp for ups he doesnt need to figure anything out he just uses his super strength and lex luthers brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junkbr br to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasnt grey poupon he was looking at
