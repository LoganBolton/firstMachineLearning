special effects goodbr br script terrible no plot no depth no meaning this film rendered superman as a meaningless hero a hero with no archetype in the original film he represented america in the cold war here he represented nothing but a hulkbr br sure the actors were fine kevin spacey was a fine choice among othersbr br this still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever i cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film when superman was and is daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in peoples minds this was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have takenbr br just a few instances lex luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism political domination totalitarianism and on and on and on he was just another goofball hackman incarnationbr br and superman for what did he stand in this film nothing but another hack savior figurebr br wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all
