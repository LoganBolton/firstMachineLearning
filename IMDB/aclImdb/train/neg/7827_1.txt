first let me just comment on what i liked about the movie the special effects were fantastic and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game there that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i cant even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing br br i have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where loiss 5 yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of superman when the crying superchild throws a piano at lexs henchman to save his mother i almost got up and left the theater singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child its been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit br br my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space it doesnt take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out whats wrong with that i dont know how many comic books brian singer has read but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any supermanrelated projects ever again the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas thats not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground br br my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a godlike jorel sent to earth to be a savior jorel wasnt allwise he was just a scientist and he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode ill buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christs primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until im too braindead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman returns the passion of the christbr br and speaking of luthor my last major complaint has to do with singers depiction of lex luthor lex luthor is a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world the man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman returns as well as all the previous superman movies is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singers next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show zam whap powbr br to summarize i dont know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion is wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you havent already dont see it dont buy it when it comes out on dvd dont rent itbasically dont contribute any money towards it in any way this movie does not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that sees this movie bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars if youre a superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and youll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time
