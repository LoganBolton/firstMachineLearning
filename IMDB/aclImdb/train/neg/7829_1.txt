the beginning of the 90s brought many quirky and offbeat independent films a particular subgenre of which is the semispiritual desert crime movie others of note are wild at heart from dusk til dawn and to a certain extent natural born killers good films like those spawned junk like highway 666 destiny turns on the radio and this ineptly surreal antimasterpiece under the hula moon its a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone attains it but keeps going to the point of irritation while the pursuit across the spiritworld of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie and isnt focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy i wont blow the ending but lets just say its bad the film is basically a bad side effect of genrecancer this is the dregs of indiemania
