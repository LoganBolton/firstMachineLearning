with its companion piece masters of horror nightmares and dreamscapes can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with the twilight zone and the outer limitsbr br of course part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience instead aiming at tenyearolds who are only able to count bodybags and scarcely that and so grossness is king and king is grossnessbr br stephen king is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of bart simpson since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the moviesbr br true the cinema is not such a bad place to start since it has generally escaped the onslaught of realism but these films are only the rumor not the thing and if you want to write you have to dig deeperbr br of course only pickman had monsters as close acquaintances but even so it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not dracula and lugosibr br at least autopsy room four is a clear indication of what is wrong one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scarybr br not mind you trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part making the stupid stupider but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things wouldnt that be gross and that boys and girls is the storybr br what about characterization oh yes hes one of these suits who never really appreciated life you know and now its too late right and hes shouting  well they cant actually hear him you know  hes saying that hes going to sue the hospital but hes not such a big shot anymore you see lying there or is it laying i can never remember and all and hes thinking oh no please please dont cut me and this is terrible lying or laying like that  now wouldnt that be a great story you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie what was the name of that snake again oh yeah a boomslang  has quite a ring to it doesnt itbr br lets make it a peruvian boomslang sure steve thats great  except that boomslang is afrikaans you moron but how can you really tell that the target audience is children and not simply mental defects its easy theres no sexbr br well there is but its the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parents bedroom modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre the monster the female victim the chasebr br but unlike universal and lewton they have no idea whats going on all thats really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evilbr br in spite of a certain discrepancy in size king kong knew exactly what to do with fay wray freddy krueger can only kill herbr br and since theres no real titillation in that he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her you understand since that would upset our puritan sentiments and so horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopathsbr br our hero you see is a rubber fetishist and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves giggle and thats what they use in autopsies and thats how they discover that he is in fact you knowbr br obviously this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers too bad they cut it out since it might have upset the fiveyearolds watching the show
