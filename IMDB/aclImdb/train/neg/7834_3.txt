i usually dont write reviews but i cant understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchersbr br i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché it wasnt even funny any more the same old stories youve probably seenread a couple of times already  living toys evil things from other dimensions and its not just that these stories arent innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés id prefer eg chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime and dont even ask about the visual effects the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second awful looks like some film students project gone wrong blood or gore erm nothing worth mentioningbr br it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasnt seenread that many scary stories yet although id rather recommend beyond belief  now thats what i call a decent mystery tv show but for an adult horror fan this is worthless i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting
