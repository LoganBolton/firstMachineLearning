the majority of stephen kings short stories are little gems with original ideas that dont take a long time to develop basically lean and meanhe sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages you read em and youre finished before you know youve begun theyre like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonalds friesthey taste really good and you know theres not much nutritional value in them re from a literary standpoint they dont say much about the universal human condition but youre still gonna scarf em down just dont be a pig and go for the extrasupersized portion and fill up on too much grease too much grease is a metaphor for the prose in kings novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come onenough with the popcultural observations or clever yankee asidesget on with the story already he has compiled four books of short story collections ive read them allfrom nightshift to the latest everythings eventual and they all display an efficiency of gettingtothepoint which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tomesized novelsbr br but his short stories never overstay their welcomewhich brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapesbr br how in the hell did they the series producers get a greenlight to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes ill tell you howtwo wordsstephen king stories with his name on them probably didnt come cheap and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones sowhat should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial timekachingbr br im not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these storiesthis review supposes you have already read the stories andor seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented of the four installments so far heres my ten cent assessment from first to worst br br battleground not a classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog and the tongueincheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the teleplay who is richard mathesons sonthe writer of tot knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to hurts apartment than it should have but i think it fulfilled its objective 810br br umneys last case liked this one primarily because of william h macys performance i think the writerumney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eyeumney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the chandleresque setup was due to get interrupted by the writers reality so lets get on with it already and cutout the cute and clever hardboiled repartee private dick banter already once the writerumneys family tragedy began to reveal though i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the reallife macys attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creations exciting life 610 br br the end of the whole mess uh this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes i was ready to scream at the tvok we get it already the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire we know from ron livingston talking to the camera time is running out for menot fast enough i thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanitywe know this because hes already built an airplane but almost died because he couldnt steer it out of the path of a tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision so much time was wasted on establishing the ubergenius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discoverythe end of the world through unintended idiocyhow much do we get to see of the world endinga cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what shes reporting on and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brothers parents drooling and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world i wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with a whimper indeed 210 br br crouch end this episode just ticked me off totally i could have lived with the takingforever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slapandtickle having lunch and getting a taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossedover into crouch end the episode delivered the chills but it failed miserabley not only wasnt it scary it was practically laughable ooh looka kittywait it turnsoh my god look at its scary eye uhhuh they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but i guess the budget wasnt high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldnt and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and actingthose were truly horrifying 110 br br overall series average so far 410
