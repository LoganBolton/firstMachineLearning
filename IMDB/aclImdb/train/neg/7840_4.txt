this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school watching as the rawandan genocide unfurls around himbr br the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of rawanda then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic newcomer a young teacher who doesnt take life or the situation too seriously as he and the driver approach a roadblock he plays around with his drivers id not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver cant identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers theyll be killed and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him suddenly realizes that every rawandan including his driver is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help the media cameras cannot stop machetes and theres too many machete wielding militiamen too shoot the title comes from the armies captain saying hes going to shoot the dogs eating the deadbodies around his compound but wont shoot the militiamen that are killing people around the compound mainly because they havent fired at the soldiers yet finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims flees with his tail inbetween his legs rather than face immanent death with the school kids hes promised not to leave behindbr br its more of character study and a come to jesus moment for one character than a story about the genocide in rawanda this movie didnt have to take place in rawanda it could have taken place any one of the genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time
