caught this by accident on a tv showing  and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was by comparison the original a man called horse was spellbinding because it held ones interest throughout but this piece of nonsense  words fail me it was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the socalled sioux spoke for goodness sake couldnt the filmmakers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and nearactors to perform as indians in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes absolutely terrible in all respects
