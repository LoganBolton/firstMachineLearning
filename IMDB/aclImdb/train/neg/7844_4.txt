no one goes to a movie like the hills have eyes 2 and expects the second coming of citizen kane the same is true for the majority of lowrent horror flicks especially those roger ebert has dubbed dead teenager movies the hills have eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a dead teenager movie only here the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military traineesbr br some will argue the line its only a movie when questionable facts are raised in a movie review but ive always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective in the hills have eyes 2 were to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert the dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess though the films arent nearly comparable i kept imagining these soldiers being in platoon and shuddering with dreadbr br very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations a colonel is addresses as hey asshole by a private and nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do or any sense of command structure when things begin to go wrong i think of the soldiers in james camerons aliens a film of pure fantasy and how even those futuristic marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations fantasy rooted in realitybr br i try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10 and judge its strengths and weaknesses from there you have to allow concessions for the material theres no way star wars is as good of a movie as the godfather on equal terms but both are excellent examples of their typebr br in that respect while the hills have eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing its only modestly worse in that regard than the typical dead teenager movie on a technical side the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective scenes that are intended to shock or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work so while watching the hills have eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulationbr br its worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage or those who dont tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the best ever or the worst ever of all time if you dont get horror especially the dead teenager variety youre not likely to have a good time with this onebr br 410
