just recently ive been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that i almost had to see it well having just seen it today the 58 rating is completely understandable i think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need it turns out not to be worth it br br sure the hills have eyes 2 has its moments it has a very cool and welldeveloped storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself but the whole thing is so selfindulged that it becomes so hard to follow and if it werent for wes cravens production on this film it wouldnt be anything to do with the original remake br br but the whole thing makes you go is this supposed to be horror or comedy because there are lots of ridiculous randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners ie theres a hand in the sher or you motherfuer ill kill you all damn sons of btches and the acting god dont even remind me how bad it wasbr br storyline this part contains spoilers beware the movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby ooh la la and then the screen fades to black with the movies title appearing and a monologue then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins we find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants the box to keep track of audio feeds is gone and everyone dies after that tonesetting opening youd expect morebr br then we go to this one team of military recruits training in baghdad as the captain parades them a good job at stupidity their last day of training is in new mexico the desert where the family in the last thhe had stayed because they were stuck while in training things go ultimately wrong people die and do i need to tell you any more because right now i have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type thisbr br the thing thats wrong with thhe2 is that it just dosent work no flashbacks here and the ending is pretty safe but with a twist a stupid one that is im pretty sure the ultra super directors cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to the hills have eyes 3 will showcase all of its alternate endings but at this point im not sure if i care br br so by all means if you loved the first thhe so much its almost a sin not to see this then by all means see it but if else then avoid at all costs its for your own goodbr br 310
