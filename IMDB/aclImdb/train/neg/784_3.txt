despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyonebr br the story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and winsbr br in girlfight its boxing in bend it like beckham its soccer and now its kung fubr br but fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it semra turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she cant do is to act her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director the rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this clich√© movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offerbr br even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this its just so boring the slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet br br the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because its european its very easy to publicize this movie  a first martial arts film from denmark but dont be fooled its not its just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincingbr br bad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story
