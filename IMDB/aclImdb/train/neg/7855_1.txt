i couldnt believe my eyes once ive watched this movie theres no point in it either then blood and violence unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood gore and killing one after another this movie isnt interesting at all has no meaningful plot or story line nor does it have an intelligence in it the blood looks very fake and this movie overall is pointless dont even waste your time with it its just an hour or two of mindless violence it has many bloody scenes that arent scary but just plain revolting this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw
