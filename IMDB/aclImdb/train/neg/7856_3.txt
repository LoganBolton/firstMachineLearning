this movie pretty much sucked im in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible if your in the military and you see this movie youll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad it was ridiculous they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do it was a pretty gory movie id have to say the least there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump id recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent gory movie it will be a better movie also if your not in the military i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one
