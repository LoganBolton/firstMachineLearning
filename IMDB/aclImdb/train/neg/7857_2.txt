isnt anyone else tired of that old clich√© where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film gives us some informations and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason i know i ambr br the sad thing is that its use in this film is worthless if you have seen the first film the first remake i should say then the information given is completely worthless because you would have already known it i guess you can that it isnt worthless to the main charactersbut then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head wouldnt he want to live sure he would have died anywaybr br this is the second film to be titled the hills have eyes ii the first being the sequel to the original 70s film this is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me see im probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a hhe2 to begin with much less an original hhe1 and now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original hhe1it just makes it worse but anywaysbr br wes cravens original hills have eyes was decent in the end though the idea was better than the presentation but he most likely had a low budget to be quite honest wes craven isnt that good of a horror director hes only made a few good horror movies nightmare on elm st new nightmare a few alright ones scream and a bunch of horrible ones cursed shocker vampire in brooklyn oh yeah and he made swamp thing as wellbut the original hhe2 falls under the latter category ive only seen a few minutes but it was terriblebr br now he has cowritten the new hhe2and its such a disappointment last years hhe remake was even better than the original film it was tense i guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers it made us feel dirty for the first hour we were in hell and finally in the last few moments the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt goodbr br this new film has no tension no suspense whatsoever just violent things happening to mostly stupid people there is hardly any menacing presence here just ugly hobos hiding under rocksbr br im getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making it was just the other day that i watching deep blue sea where samuel l jackson kept on walking around the water while giving the speech and then he gets eaten by a shark only because the idiot stayed to close to the watersomething that nobody would do in the given situation here is the exact same thing people go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dyingseriously couldnt a potty break wait and then when you think people would have learned someone else goes of by themselves seriously isnt more scary when the characters are bringing their agame and still losing i would think sobr br it even under delivers it should have made the first remake look like the fog remake which was less menacing than an episode of becker more bad guys more time in the caves more tension more of everythingbr br but it actually downgrades less bad guys no tension sure we have more time in the caves but not a whole lot happens there in the end it only seems like there is two or three bad guys the last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people where is this tribe who keeps on watching them through binoculars seriously these are the things this film should have brought us but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us with that exact same being watched scene come on ill give the devil its due the look of the film is goodbut thats itbr br i dont even think fans of gore will like thisthough im probably wrong there is gore though most of it is spedup while in the dark but without the tension and characters you even care aboutthe gore does nothing in my book in the end youre not frightened youre not shocked unless youre an 8 year old girl you dont even feel like you have seen anything new
