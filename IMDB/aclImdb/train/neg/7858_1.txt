i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of horror movies but they should at least hire some proper actors the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has but lets face it the lines arent really important there isnt really a recognisable plot so most of the writing involves the words fk st mfr and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialoguebr br the story as it is is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death with a couple of cringeworthy surprises which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly whats going to happen not only this but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors why are they going in there didnt he have a weapon wasnt he dead so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix thembr br another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience
