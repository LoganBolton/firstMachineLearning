martin weisz who directed the solid rohtenburg will be taking the heat with wes craven for another shabby the hills have eyes 2 the memory of the legendary original which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake in name only a bunch of national guardsmen and women are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants one by one the weekend soldiers are picked off thats it there is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene but there is precious little else to get excited about the films heroes are the usual bunch of clich√©s and the mutants a far cry from cravens original family mostly resemble brian thompson from cobra coupled with some creatures stan winston had left over from the wrong turn shoot much of the action takes place in caves ala the descent and is well shot by sam mccurdy a laughable aspect is wes and jonathan cravens addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like leatherface in hoopers original chainsaw weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle but hes not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations not a fan unfortunately
