the premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake i expected a lot sincerelybr br the sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept the situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awfulbr br this time there arent likable characters or violins unlike the remake also the gore is not that abundant and when it happens its truly badbr br the violence is minimal and its a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that theres room for heavy violence i mean theres a swat team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants you surely expect something different when i watched it on the movies i wanted my money backbr br anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspectsbr br a mess that let down the fans of the remake like me thats why sequels are never welcomed at least this movie isnt as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original
