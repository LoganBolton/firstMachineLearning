okay lets not get confused here if this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classics sequel heres to hoping thats not a general rule as wes cravens own sequel to the original the hills have eyes  released somewhere during the mid80s  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made part two didnt have an actual plot and reused footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories as the loyal german shepard of the carter family reexperienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies there were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well the remake came out barely one year ago and heres the sequel already the incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script dont they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary menacing and disturbing with his excellent film alexandre aja nearly singlehandedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for also aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic high tension but who is this new director ajas the hills have eyes was an unexpected hit appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and overenthusiast target groups its a really good film and even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable its highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of ajas smashing hit bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism i must admit this rushed sequel really isnt as awful as anticipated the screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsivelooking freaks after the events of the first film the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests which took place there in the 50s and 60s for the horribly mutated survivors of the miners community that stayed there during the radioactive testing the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the minesbr br this basically is just another bythenumbers slasher with dumb characters who are even after losing several of their friends already still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill its also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3yearold son the hills have eyes ii completely lacks  as to be expected  originality logic and plausible situations the mutated miners arent nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one mainly because they arent organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sexhungry prototype monsters since you dont care for the amateur gi joe heroes and definitely dont feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last years original most peculiarly this second film isnt nearly as violent and gory as the first sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprisetwists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly arent any outrageous pickaxe battles or virulent dog attacks what a shame whats the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness andor gratuitous filth of the original luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental and youll have the most fun spotting all the things that dont make the slightest bit of sense for example wallets falling out of peoples bloodied heads women without any muscle power cast as toughass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the one soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications
