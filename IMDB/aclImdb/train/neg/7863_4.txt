thhe2 is entertaining in that youll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sht and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along those lines but i dont know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who dont seem to know the first thing about combatbr br yes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching ajas remake for the 5th timebr br so go for some laughs or go for some gore but dont go hoping to come out of it satisfied
