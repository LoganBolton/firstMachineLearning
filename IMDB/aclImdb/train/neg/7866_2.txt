the hills eyes ii one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest or worst however you choose to look at it while 2006s hills remake was one of the years best and truly frightening horror films this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment part 2 never gets off the ground and neither does its mind numbing dialogue worst of all its not that scarybr br 2006s remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the new mexico desert deserted and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people people who as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago have become who they are surviving off travelers who wander into the region the sequel puts audiences in the same desert now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family when a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite they find it deserted with no signs of life a grim reality soon befalls them as they come to the realization that theyre not alone and the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destinybr br it doesnt take a genius to realize that hills has no legitimate reason to exist but because last years remake was received well both at the box office and by critics it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while theres still money to be earned theres no rhyme or reason to it this time around just an unbelievable and ridiculous setup to pave the way for thoughtless characters unoriginal killings a nonexistent story and slipping interest originally director alexander aja made cravens cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience one that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions its frank display of violence sadistic torture wellrounded characterization and whiteknuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences the second time around its rehashed handmedowns theres no style no grit it tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies when all it really does is make for a been there done that kind film where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbathsbr br its a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention its a bore nothing more hills has no bite despite a jump or two here and there theres nothing very scary about this bythenumbers horror flick it feels like something youd see on the scifi channel only with some fbombs a blood splatter here and there a rape and a graphic birth scene thats more gross than shocking its cheap and with hills you reap what you sew with no effort given you cant expect anything in returnbr br replacing aja with martin weisz as director was the films first big mistake all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance but even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by wes craven and his son jonathan craven you ask how bad could it possibly be this is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like shakespeare craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past but id never expect something like this from him its so unintentionally funny you have to wonder is craven playing a joke on this or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off the films characters are onedimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense the acting is just as bad the only character who may win you over is napoleon napoli the scrawny kid who doesnt fit in with the others even the deranged and instinctdriven villains who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago are met with indifferent you dont hate them you dont like them you honestly couldnt care less just like this moviebr br even if you were giddy with fear during the hills have eyes as i was youll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage its as generic as generic gets and theres absolutely nothing here we havent seen done many times already i cant express this enough avoid the hills have eyes ii like the plague its frightless unoriginal frantic and a bore stick to the remake or cravens original vision because if you dont walk out after the first thirty minutes dont say i didnt warn you
