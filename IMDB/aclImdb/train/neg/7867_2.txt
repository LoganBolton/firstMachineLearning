okay ive tried and ive tried but i still dont get this guy maddin thing tales from the gimli hospital left me cold that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story departmentand this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring im glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino theyre empty homages to better more imaginative filmsfilms that advanced the art form or broke new groundand are all style and no substance no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesnt write embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on intertitles the bottom line is maddins schtick is clever clever filmmaking for aspiring film majors
