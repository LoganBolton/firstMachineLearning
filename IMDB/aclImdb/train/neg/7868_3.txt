ive seen many of guy maddins films and liked most of them but this one literally gave me a headache john gurdebekes editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tourdeforce sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object does nothing but interfere with the actors ability to communicate with the audiencebr br another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddins earlier worksthough his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity this one seemed more like harshness for harshness sakebr br as im required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well
