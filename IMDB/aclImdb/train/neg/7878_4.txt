i am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad first of all it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie toon or an adult one that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving funny moments in the beginningbr br but thats hardly important the film is simply boring unmoving and not true to the original story it simply fails to transfer to the picture all the points orwell tried to make to his bookbr br spoilerbr br second revolution havent they guys learned anything who be the next napoleon then benjamin
