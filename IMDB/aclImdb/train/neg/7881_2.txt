this film is a portrait of the halfspastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math he didnt make the best experiences in life before and got serious selfesteem issues after a rough start at his new school he starts making friends falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuffbr br beside some comedy elements the film is told in a very serious way focussing on benjamin and his problemsbr br if you already dont like this story outline save your time and watch something else if you do please be aware of the followingbr br 1 benjamin is a total loser whatever he does he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for selfpity all the time for me he wasnt that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watchingbr br 2 the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just arent except for janosch maybe and yes i know this film is based on an autobiography written by a 17year old  but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself i dont believe himbr br 3 showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject but i doubt that teenage boys do an ejaculate on the cookiecontest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during massmasturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the spermwet cookie afterwards although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way its nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this filmbr br 4 theres a subplot about benjamins family and his father betraying his wife  still i dont know why its there and where to put it it just bored mebr br well i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin being without a message concept scheme whatever and its failing attempts to be dramatic and serious however i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching if you liked the other sister youll probably like this one too i hated bothbr br 17year old boys shouldnt write an autobiography and if they do it doesnt seem to be the best idea to make a film out of itbr br 2 out of 10
