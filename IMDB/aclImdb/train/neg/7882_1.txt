after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch we stumbled on this it looked appealing from the summary at least so we gave it a try and heres the kicker the first 20 minutes are interesting its actually enjoyable oh wait spoke too soonbr br somewhere in there the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental rightwing christian brainwashing not entirely sure what happens but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there finished writing this script and had no time to edit it because he had a kkk meeting to get to with his friends from the westboro church and his hood wasnt cleanbr br can they put warnings on this i refuse to support this religious idiocy much like video games have rating systems movies need some sort of symbol maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worsebr br unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how youll convert your neighbors dont waste your time its some of the worst junk thats come out in a very long time and the radical religious nuts dont need anymore funding
