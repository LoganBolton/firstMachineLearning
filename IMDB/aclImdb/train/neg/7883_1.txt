the deceptive cover title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this moviebr br it started out really well and pulled me in i really liked it between 13 and 34s of it the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense my first thought was this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story i ended up rewatching parts of the movie thinking i had missed somethingbr br by the time i reached the last 15 of the movie it was all boring annoying religion thumping dialog that made no sense said nothing and was annoying to listen to i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the endbr br dont waste your time with this flickbr br beware of dvds labeled whitlow films and level path productionsbr br and im a practicing catholic
