i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies when i want a sermon ill go to church but i dont want one from a movie i dont mind some supernatural themes after all religion is about as supernatural as you can get but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had horns br br and what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men and that broke the spell if only life were that simple i think that when movies are that stupid they ought to be distributed with a warning danger preaching contained herein
