then they will have a proper place to file this crap sorry not a mystery as claimed it is religious mumbojumbo i kept waiting for the unimaginable evil that was promised me but the evil in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilitiesbr br i cant believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future im also a little cheesed off that i now have a writers name and directors name to memorize as ill be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on toobr br its really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 etc will get their reviews posted first this could lead to more people getting tricked as i was into believing this movie was something other than religious preachingbr br well its off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising too bad they cant give me back the 105 minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horrorsupernatural film
