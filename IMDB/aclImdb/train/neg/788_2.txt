a film with very little positive to say for itbr br firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any dramabr br besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again i lost count of how many times i had seen that field at night or that bit of cracked earthbr br it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience dont know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that its fine we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre beth has a key to a warehouse of books there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie much later in fact too latebr br and on the point of the acre horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if theyre meant to be an acre big then make them sobr br there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth the best performer in the piece followed by jefferson  the cop suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on medicationbr br with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child did he crawl out of the window hes six months old the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene bad plinky plonk horror music fails to add atmospherebr br often bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre which is just bad
