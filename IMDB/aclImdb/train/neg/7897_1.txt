this movie was made for people who found gremlins too serious and critters to hardcore like many of the critterstrollsgremlins movies of the 80s this movie is bad the sad part is that theres no punchline to that comment its just bad and not in a funny waybr br the problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as howie mandell was in walk like a man what made the other 80s horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary but were hilarious because they failed so miserably someone must have told bettina hirsch yes the bettina hirschshe had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie unfortunately they were wrongbr br sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the lost boys is amusing but not enough to save the moviebr br by far the most annoying part of the movie is the paul character his paul reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guynot that i did thatbr br so the bottom line is run dont walk to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves
