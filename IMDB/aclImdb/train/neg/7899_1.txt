i suppose all the inside jokes is what made munchies a cult classic i thought it was awful though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters it probably couldve been a much better and funnier movie maybe all they needed was a real budgetbr br munchies as many viewers have pointed out already is something of a gremlins parody hence all the references to the movie the movie begins somewhere in peru during an archeological dig an annoying dufus named paul aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans is holed up with his dad in the caves his dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything but proof of ufos and thats where the munchies come into the picture hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a gizmo voice they name him arnold stash him in a bag and bring him home so pauls dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial lifebr br paul the idiot that he is breaks his promise to his dad to watch arnold a wager he made with his dad if he loses its off to community college to get a real career the creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug cecil television veteran harvey korman wonders what his neighbors are up to so he and his lazy son some airhead hippie type who looks more like they shouldve made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast to go and snatch arnold why a get rich quick scheme of course and of course even cecils son is too dumb to look after arnold and after a few pokes and prods at arnold he multiplies into more munchiesbr br this wasnt even a movie that was so bad it was good it was just plain awful i was hoping that the munchies wouldve mutated and killed the morons that were always after them even paul and his girlfriend at least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets and really bad writing all aroundit wasnt even funnynot even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye like i said munchies if they had been given an actual budget and better actors they mightve been able to pull off a good parody pass
