the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the storyits something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reasonthere were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didnt really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorterwhich would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past weekid have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one
