cute and playful but lame and cheap munchies is another gremlins clone to come out from the 80s im not much of a fan of the imitationsbr br first it was the excellent gremlinsbr br then came the very average crittersbr br lets not forget the lousy ghouliesbr br but the complete pits would have to go to hobgoblinsbr br is there more br br now munchies for me would have to fall somewhere between ghoulies and hobgoblins actually i probably found it more entertaining than ghoulies but i preferred thst ones darker tone br br from the getgo it plays up its goofy nature which its better for it but due to that nature the hammy acting alix elias and charlie phillips can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok thats where the fun occurs mostly lighthearted fluff though as the story mainly centres on the munchies who are either hungry horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase its silly but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed as theyre basic dolls being chucked about where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak and with attitudebr br charlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde who was in critters were fair leads harvey korman was acceptable in two roles robert picardo also pops upbr br amusingly lowcut entertainment for the undemanding
