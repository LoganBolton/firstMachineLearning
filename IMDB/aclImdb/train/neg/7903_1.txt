i think i watched this movie but dont quote me as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it didnt exactly grip my excitement and imagination at least i know i watched enough of it to know i wont be watching it again soon or everbr br jeez talk about lame really lame totally lame it wouldnt even appeal to a six year old it basically had no worthwhile dramatic impact zilch nada just shlock turned into dreck comedy that was supposed to be comedy ya coulda fooled meeeeebr br now if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie critters we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly smugly cutesy like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they wouldnt be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint drybr br dont bother watching this its not worth the effort you can find something more interesting to do like watching paint dry or falling asleep
