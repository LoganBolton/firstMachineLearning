munchies starts in deepest darkest peru looks more like a dirt road to me where archaeologist simon watterman harvey korman  his son paul charles stratton are on an expedition simon thinks that ancient aztec buildings were in fact spacecraft control centres  he is on a mission to gain proof that alien lifeforms have visited earth while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his backpack  takes back home with him to the small american town of sweetwater in california simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for  for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery simon asks paul  his wife cindy nadine van der velde to take care of it meanwhile simons brother  fastfood businessman cecil watterman harvey korman again steals the creature so his brother wont make any money out of it but his idiotic stepson dude jon stafford has a fight with it  chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the townspeoplebr br directed by bettina hirsch this has to be one of the worst horror comedys ever if not the worst the script by lance smith is so unfunny its painful every joke in munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile i doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to preteens there just isnt anything even remotely funny or even amusing in munchies as far as im concerned the basic story is crap too they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is why noones ever seen it before how it manages to learn english so quickly  how it learns to drive etc the whole thing is a big gremlins 1984 ripoff with none of the elements that made that film so good the characters are moronic the stupid deputy charlie phillips  his dad hardy rawls cecil wearing an embarrassing wig  fake moustache  his air head wife melvis alix elias  more besides they just plain embarrass  are ridiculous i defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny basically munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror  ends up being yes youve guessed it crapbr br director hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here  it shows the entire thing takes place in two houses the desert some caves  a miniature golf course this is really cheap  incompetent filmmaking the special effects on the munchies themselves are really awful their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to its arm i cannot stress how bad the effects are these things wouldnt convince my 4 year old nephew as proved by me  him yesterday total incompetence all the way this film sucksbr br technically the film is terrible bad special effects lame production design rubbish sets  well just everythings crap the acting is rotten through  through from the cops to korman who has two roles both of which prove he cant act  isnt funnybr br munchies is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve sure watch it if you want i wont stop you but just dont say you werent warned my advice would be to watch gremlins again instead but the decision is yours
