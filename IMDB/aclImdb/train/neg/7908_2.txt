i didnt expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out still i held out hope it sounded a bit much like bride and prejudice la guy falls for an indian beauty parental conflict blah blah blah bp was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable charactersbr br my bollywood bride had none of that the acting seemed stilted and way to bythenumbers characters were so clich√© the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student technically the sound really bothered me it seemed as if there was a lot of overdubbing of dialogue i mean a lot i know sometimes its necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distractingbr br two stars is being somewhat generous
