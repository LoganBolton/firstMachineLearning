i saw most of my bollywood bride today at the iaac film festival in new york and had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea welling up within me ive seen bollywood movies and ive seen satires of bollywood movies this movie couldnt decide which one it wanted to be so it ended up being a joke on itselfbr br it seems to have been liberally copied from movies like bride and prejudice and bollywood calling and what a sloppy lazy job at that how can bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused welltrodden scripts is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people the oversmart auto driver the cow on the street gratuitous scenes of foreign locations pointless scenes of mumbai streets theyre all in there every possible clich√© about india has been faithfully included so sickeningly predictable ugh acting performances are weak across the board except for neha dubey who is talented and beautiful one wonders why she would pick a project like this
