it wasnt notable enough to be truly horrible it was just incredibly lame the story was not half bad but the execution was just horrendousbr br to start with it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on it was just paced badly the dialog was so utterly unsparkling just flat and boringbr br and the characters cripes almightly they made deadpool boring how the hell do you make deadpool boring he wasnt even funny he wasnt crazy he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properlybr br gambit was boring and since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves i mean we know they are mutants but they still exist within the realm of physics a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade you cannot fly by twirling superduper fast which gambit wouldnt be able to do anyway nor deadpool especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreographybr br and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know wth they are doing and know better than to use it in every single shot as a replacement for real fight choreographybr br three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics logan creed and wilson and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory it was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guysbr br and then you had the break out with all these mutants who did nothing even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers nice to see a quicksilver nod did fall when they got out only emmareallylameforthisfilmfrost and cyclops did somethingbr br and since when was logan so pretty and the stupid the bullet will take his memory away dont you think xavier and the xmen would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they xrayed him in x1 i felt sorry for liev schrieber man he actually brought in a good sabretooth considering the script he made one of marvels more simple super villains feel real but he could not save the film from its own epic lamenessbr br seriously this was daredevil level of suck decent story good actors absolutely horrible execution
