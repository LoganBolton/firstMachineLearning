most would agree that the character of wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history im no marvel expert but i did grow up with the adventures of the xmen and definitely approved of hugh jackmans now widely known portrayal of the scruffy logan i enjoyed the first xmen found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment all through the three movies i probably enjoyed jackman more than anything else i figured the idea of making an originsmovie about wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three xmen movies if we concentrate on one character i figured there could be a movie that achieves what i found the second movie failed at  being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventurebr br the reason that the wolverinemovie fails is not because the competition is tougher after the dark knight its not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary  even though that certainly isnt good  no its because the movie doesnt even seem to try to begin with this does not qualify as good entertainment there is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very very automatic with no greater special effects or elements of suspense and when one event will make you predict the following five it almost feels like an uwe boll movie imitating an actionadventure movie concept that youve seen a dozen times before of course nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of bollst but when everybodys talking clich√©s as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enoughbr br but there is an even bigger problem even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities i think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title i mean origins really what to the people behind this movie think about that title what do they mean you want to know the origins of wolverine he grew up with his brother they ran away from home during dramatic circumstances then they went off to war all of them the civil war world war i and ii and vietnam too why did they do this still unknown eventually the brother sabertooth played by liev shrieber became evil how you ask i dont know it was somewhere between omaha beach and hanoi yeah but why you still ask i just said i dont know the movie doesnt explain hes evil alright yeah but you know origins yeah well thats an origin i mean duh anyway eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers something with the government hohum wolvie gets enough and leave his brother for six years hes a happy lumberjack with a loved one who ends up a little defenseless around the time sabretooth suddenly appears again yeaaah but whyyyy  oh shut up  and wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a fleshcovered metal war animal he goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped cue xmen the first moviebr br there thats the origin you can also find it on the back of the dvd cover the actual movie wont tell you anything else with no worthwhile scenes of action no good heroes villains or characters in general lines from my couch audience fat suit token black guy oh i give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie that is supposed to be gambit mmhm yeah well uhhuh right not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a tshirt with added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right fans will check this out or have already theres no stopping that but if you liked the xmen movies for no other reason than that they were wellmade and entertaining  see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none
