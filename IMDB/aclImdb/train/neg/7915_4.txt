all of the xmen movies were great and i mean all of them including the long hated xmen 3 they had solid characters magneto and xavier were the best ones in my opinion and a good story archbr br i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie i was so disappointedbr br hugh jackman is not a bad actor his best movie is the fountain although you wont hear about this movie when they talk about the actor and his acting is not what screws the movie upbr br the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot like blob or gambit which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comicsbr br i am a fan of xmen i have read many many of their stories and this movie respected none of them none not even the continuity it doesnt respect weapon x project or the relationship between wolverine and sabretooth or emma frost the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies revenge for the death of a loved onebr br oh what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a berseker moment for wolverine similar to the one he has in x2 in the school when stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces but hey this is fox this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel herobr br besides i had a feeling of constant dejá vù with this movie because wolverines origins are already explained in x2 we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already knowbr br i personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid backstory because mystery is the nature of the character do we really want to know how the joker got his scars
