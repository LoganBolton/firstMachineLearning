where to begin how about with the erroneous synopsis br br xmen origins wolverine tells the story of wolverines epically violent and romantic past his complex relationship with victor creed and the ominous weapon x programbr br his epically violent past turns out to exceptionally nonviolentbr br his relationship with creed is so glossed over its difficult to understand how they have any connection at all we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassinsbr br there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving br br the romantic element of the movie between silverfox and wolverine was forced and abrupt we are thrown into a romance so fast that its over before you can blink an eye having just introduced the character silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later we are left wondering why we should care about this who was she anywaybr br for a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story the romance is surprisingly unexplored it was rushed in simply because it was requiredbr br oddly enough when wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find sabertooth being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprisebr br as for the weapon x program lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure wolverine is up and running eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple surprisingly ma and pa kent arent alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn is it any wonder what fate awaits thembr br in the previous films and the comic books the main reason that wolverines amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldbloodedbr br knowing this was the casedid he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team matesbr br as hinted to in x2 xmen united when stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together this film sets up the team fairly well only they dont really do much of anything no disturbing violence no ruthless actions they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen br br it seems that wolverine wasnt an evil man under stryker at all instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother sabertooth which consequently was the violent agent we all thought wolverine was eventually he just leaves all togetherbr br no conflict of duality here at allbr br idiotically removing that character conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely they may as well have given him rubber clawsbr br there were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the xmen trilogy including the introduction of one of the lamest deus ex machinas to ever hit a scriptbr br magic memoryerasing bullets br br reallybr br apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at allbr br another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story most were in the film for 510 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverinebr br fred dukes the blob but not the comic version can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all but a simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze himbr br cyclops optic beams which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes adamantium trench coats anyonebr br the gravity defying mutant gambit instead of utilizing his signature cards is made into some sort of crazy acrobat in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverinethen amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running towards wolverine how he regained consciousness ran away a few blocks climbed up a building then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explainedbr br some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrectbr br the comic book source material the real origin of wolverineis a story worth bringing to the screen it doesnt sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies it is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time began with weapon x by barry windsorsmith a much more intense and exciting storybr br this fox film should seriously be forgotten br br anyone have that magic gunbr br 410
