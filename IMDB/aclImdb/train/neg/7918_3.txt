i found the writing in this movie absolutely terriblebr br the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was lacy chaberts performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well for me she was definitely the highlight of this moviebr br dina meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i dont think one can say that her acting was greatbr br as for the male lead armand assante his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital seriesbr br all of that i could have lived with however the terrible terrible terrible endsolution the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time
