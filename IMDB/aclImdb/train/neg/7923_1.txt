i am a huge fan of ted v mikels and the original corpse grinders is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen even the brilliant casting of the legendary liz renay desperate living could not save this worthless piece of garbage this film should serve as a lesson to all past present and future film makerswhen you have a film as successful as the original corpse grinders was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as herschel gordon lewis did with blood feast 2 all u can eat even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for gods sakenever film a movie onto videowhy do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideousi personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion thats even worth the powder to blow it to hellif you cant afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who canand what was ted v mikels thinking about or smoking when he wrote this godawful script i mean come on dog and cat aliens from another planet a cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding up human bodiesbones and clothes and all if any of these actors aside from liz renay were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid avoid this film at all costs and watch the original instead
