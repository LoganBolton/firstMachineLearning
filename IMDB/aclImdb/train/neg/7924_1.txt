ted v mikelss film corpse grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill the plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens who are losing a war with dog aliens looking to get some of this cat food watching this movie i began to look for any kind of distraction anything to reassure myself that i was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside outbr br several scenes go on for far too long as characters take forever to do simple things ive heard that mr mikels doesnt like to use jump cuts too often fearful that they will confuse his audience im not sure if this attitude is avantgarde or just stupid try as i might i could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory the majority of the cast are a bunch of notalent amateurs who dont even bother to learn the lyrics to amazing grace before they have to sing it on camera although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality since i only actually heard around 80 of the dialogue while watching the dvdbr br this is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot ive listened to snippets of the commentaryand mr mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash id like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up movies ive long hated suddenly seem a lot better i long for the intermittedly appropriate music of excalibur and the consistent lighting of dawn of the dead i need to go do something anything dont see this movie
