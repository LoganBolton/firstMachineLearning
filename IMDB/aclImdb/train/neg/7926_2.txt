the original exploitation classicthough far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added the cats cant get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970s updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy director ted mikel is a hack but is so lovable a person i generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out mikels wanted to make films and he didnt care how they turned out so long as he was producing something more power to him but i wish he wouldnt subject us to his home movies
