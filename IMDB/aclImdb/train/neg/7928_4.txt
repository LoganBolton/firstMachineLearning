actually the movie is neither horror nor scifi with a very strong christian religious theme this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense secondtier actors do halfdecent jobs of reading their boring roles the only good performance is by sydney penny who plays a role of a mother of  i wont spoil the movie its either christ or antichrist avoid watching this movie unless you a christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypsebr br being a nonchristian i had to force myself to watch this movie just because i wanted to write this review its a pity that scifi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time
