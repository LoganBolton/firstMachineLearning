the explosion of tv channels must be eternally grateful to the randolph scott western production line because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one nobudget stationbr br man behind the gun is a typical early 1950s period melodrama with prewwii production values that relies on a historicallytopical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the scripts complete absence of character development and thus lack of suspense in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like gunsmoke bonanza etc  and these actually did the job better randolph scott looking particularly grizzled in this is the good guy struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail theres no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling unless you count wondering whether hell sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the characters than the acting is but its fine if that floats your boat and i wouldnt berate you for enjoying diagnosis murder eitherbr br workmanlike pedestrian and ageing rapidly 3 stars for being competently put together 0 for artistic endeavour
