oh dearwhat a disappointment ive been watching old westerns on british tv for decades and i wasnt aware of this one until its showing yesterday  most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching againbr br the rich colour and outdoor sets were good but thats all i can say about this film i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made several times i felt like turning it off and finally i did halfway through something i hardly ever dobr br scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the mexican bandit lad and ive a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern not that this has bothered makers of many other westernsbr br perhaps it got better in the second half but i couldnt be bothered to wait and see
