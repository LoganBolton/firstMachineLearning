im a huge randolph scott fan but this film is a dud the whole thing has a canned fake soundstage feel to it with truly awful rearscreen projection it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters the directing is pedestrian and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it ive seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage productions before but this is not one of them all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scottboetticher films all the morebr br randolph scott is tanned trim and shines that million dollar smile throughout hes always a pleasureeven in the worst of his films aside from scott the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms wymore in errol flynns movie rocky mountian in man behind the gun she is just as beautiful and you can tell shes a good actress but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful ive only seen phil carey in operation pacific and he plays the exact same character herean arrogant paininthebutt you want to beat into unconsciousness i guess it proves hes a good actorhe made me hate him there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film in my opinion although there are many elements to knock i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbersbut thats not why we go to see randolph scott movies rightbr br there are definitely worse scott films out there and this one certainly isnt unbearable but it also certainly couldnt be deemed anything beyond mediocre
