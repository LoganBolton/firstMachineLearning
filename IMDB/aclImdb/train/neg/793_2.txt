i wasnt sure how to rate this movie since it was so bad it was actually very funny im not a gackt fan by any means though he is talented despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball i always thought hyde was talented though faith is an interesting albumbr br but on topic here folks this movie is ridiculous its so over the top and nonsensical its almost like a parody of supernatural action filmsbr br the movie has almost no plot here except its just about vampires with gangster friends in a way this film almost reminded me of spiderman 3 with how there were too many ideas which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of thembr br the action scenes were laughable quickly edited almost hard to understand with choreography thats so laughably bad though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes but thats this films only such redemption im a sucker for good action movies but the action was horribly done though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing moviebr br it keeps jumping between genres not a good thing it wants to be a drama or an action flick or a horror or a romance what the hellbr br if this review is making you mad why is it because gackt and hyde are your love dont fool yourself this movie is bad
