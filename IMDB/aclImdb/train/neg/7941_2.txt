as the 2000s came to a close king kongs adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an endbr br while miss winfrey was tearing up i was laughing and screaming like a wild indian from the old westbr br so what does oprah do she takes famous people and puts them on her show what kind of famous people people whove suffered just like her except these people have lost more than their virginity theyve suffered melted faces true story missing limbs true story see end of paragraph and spousal abuse too many to count and somehow they come on the show and tell their story as if we havent heard it before tons and tons of times bethany hamilton ive heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one which was october 31st 2003 dont tell me you have no hard feelings but the biggest thing probably on oprah was michael jacksons interview in 1993 after being accused of being a child molester sadly mr jackson has since passed away but that one particular show told about michaels personal life something not many people knew about at the timebr br oprahs real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms they seem to think shes like a personal jesus sometimes but all i see in oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big and shes just showing off how rich she isbr br im glad her shows going to end soon we need better television programs
