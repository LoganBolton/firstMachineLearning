when i saw this film on fearnet i thought it would be a scary movie apparently it wasnt i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site fearnet is a site that shows scary horror moviesbr br the acting is wonderful from all the actors i hated the story the story was stupid the movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen the water turns to blood the oceans die out the moon turns red etc br br the female character was annoying as well a lot of the stuff she did didnt make sense like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it coincidentally its the date shes expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all meansbr br spoiler alert br br the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where demi moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into itbr br heres what happens the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins demi moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child she touches her childs head transferring her soul into the child and then dies then the apocalypse stopsbr br why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart he gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then hes all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby br br end spoiler br br the movie is pretty stupid its another religious end of the world propaganda piece the acting from demi moore and michael biehn and everybody else is excellent thats about all there isbr br i give this movie 2 stars out of 10 good acting with a lot of nonsense
