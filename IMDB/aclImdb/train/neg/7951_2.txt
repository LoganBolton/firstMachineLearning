ive given kôhî jikô a low score not because it was a bad movie but because it doesnt do anything worth praisingbr br ive not seen any of hsiaohsien hous work before but for the uninitiated me included kôhî jikô is advertised as a homage to yasujiro ozu a japanese director whose last film was way way in 1962 the film is an extremely sparse workcontaining very little dialogue story music or emotionbr br yo hitoto plays yoko a jobless wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a taiwanese composer she likes tadanobu asano plays her friend who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains and thats about all itbr br we watch as yoko drinks coffee alonewalks aroundwaits for a traincatches a trainfalls asleep on the train the kind of mundane reality anybody in japan can see on a daily basis hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life but without any meaning to these vignettes its an entirely pointless film to make or watch
