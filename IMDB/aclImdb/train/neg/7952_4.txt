i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu whose masterfully understated views of japanese life especially in the postwwii era illuminate universal truths having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949s late spring and 1953s tokyo story i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery it is taiwanese director hou hsiaohsiens keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film among with coscreenwriter tienwen chu hsiaohsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerablebr br the story concerns yôko a young japanese writer researching the life of mid20th century taiwanese composer jiang wenye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese after 25 drawnout minutes of character setup she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan at the same time yôkos coffeehouse friend hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her hsiaohsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains while these techniques are consistent with ozus style hsiaohsien cannot seem to dive into the characters psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular yôkos plight seems rather noncommittal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents reaction overly passive to hold much interest in fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminablebr br the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable jpop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yôko while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime the rest of the characters barely register even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yôkos parents cinematographer lee pingbing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots hitoto speaksings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits hitoshian the dvd includes an hour long frenchmade documentary métro lumière which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiaohsiens approach to the film it includes excerpts from ozus films in particular equinox flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either tokyo story or early summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation setups there are also edited interview clips of hitoto asano and hsiaohsien as well as the films trailer
