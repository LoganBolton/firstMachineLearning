carrie fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem and she doesnt remember very much of it that would explain why she made this film but it doesnt explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did i cant believe that everybody had a coke problem this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made and thats saying something the blame cant be laid at the feet of director tim kincaid or writer buddy giovinazzo as it is obvious that this picture wasnt written or directed by anyone apparently it just spontaneously came together as there is little evidence of coherency consistency design plot sense intelligence or anything else what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop costar robert joy has done good work in other films and composer jimmie haskell and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans marks also having been a director and not a bad one why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension tim kincaid the alleged director has made quite a few lowrent scifi and horror films and having seen most of them i can tell you that not a one of them is any good this one though is by far the worst thing hes ever done and that is a major accomplishment on his part everything absolutely everything about this movie is 12thrateat best the cinematography is terrible the acting is laughable the special effects make plan 9 from outer space look like spiderman the story is trite derivative and stupid dont waste your time even looking at the video box cover let alone renting it a complete utter annoying total dud
