creepshow 2 is little more than a pale imitation of the original designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor which was often predictable and heavyhanded still the first time around there were enough thrills to make up for its periodic lulls resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort the sequel has few worthwhile moments so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent once in a while it delivers but most of the time it just lingers therebr br as in the original all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts a wooden indian comes to life wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves but they are utterly lacking in inspiration there are few surprises and no scares this a textbook example of unmotivated bythenumbers filmmaking it doesnt help that this cheaplooking movie suffers from a flat directorial style although to be honest there wasnt much to work with in the end the second story comes off best but not by much br br for the most part the performances are okay at best george kennedy as the illfated general store owner does an adequate if not particularly inspired job dorothy lamour on the other hand is quite good as the guiltridden motorist evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable redundant material however most of the characters are pretty thin overall br br one would think that creepshow 2 would have turned out better george romero who directed the original returned to pen the screenplay based on more of stephen kings stories makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good gory work so why is the film a letdown i guess romero didnt really want to make a second film but was forced to do so for financial reasons it was a decade of horror sequels clones ripoffs and whatnot so this one was certainly inevitable i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry picking up his paycheck and running off i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed we cant blame himbr br rating 12 out of br br released by new world pictures
