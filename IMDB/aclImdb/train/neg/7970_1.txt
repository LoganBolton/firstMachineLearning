whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies if you like them so god damn awful theyre hysterical watch away jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie ive seen in my life and ive seen long time dead and i say this as a fan of the lowbudget horrorgore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to im not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is its so so terrible its one of the funniest things ive seen in years if you can find this to rent cheap its definitely worth watching if you were involved in making it  shame on you o imdb need to introduce a 010 ranking especially for this movie it thoroughly deserves it
