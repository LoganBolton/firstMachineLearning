i am not sure who is writing thesebr br glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all i could take plot is terrible acting is even worse and there is no development at allbr br even the david cocteau films are better than this run away from jigsaw  i expected to hate the acting which can be forgiven in direct to video movies if the plot is goodbr br this had no scares very little gorebr br and a truly unattractive castbr br i watched this with three other friendsbr br who i hope are still talking to mebr br they wanted me to fling the disc out the window i can not believe anyone could havebr br given this tripe a good review
