i love b moviesbut come onthis wasnt even worth a gradethe ending was dumbbc there was no real endingnot to mention that it comes to life on its owni mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time periodand i wont even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its headand then you dont even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called new jigsaw puzzleunless you have nothing better to doid watch paint dry before id recommend this godforsaken movie to anyone elseoh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the windowthat was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
