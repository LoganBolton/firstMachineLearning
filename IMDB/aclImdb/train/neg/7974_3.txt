its interesting at first a naive park ranger colin firth marries a pretty mysterious woman lisa zane hes only known for a short time they seem to be happy then she disappears without warning he searches for her and after a few dead ends stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past which may include criminal activity and then it seems the filmmakers didnt know what to do with the story the beginning while not as suspenseful as it sounds is at least watchable then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense and the ending is so lame so dull and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence youll think the screenwriters didnt know what to do with it and got bored trying what a sorry waste of a good idea
