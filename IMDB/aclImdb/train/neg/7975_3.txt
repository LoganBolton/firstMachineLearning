as i sat in front of the tv watching this movie i thought oh what alfred hitchcock or even brian depalma could have done with this chances are you will too it does start out intrigueing a british park ranger living in los angeles collin firth marries a pretty demure brunette woman lisa zane whom he met in a park only a short time ago then one day she dissappears the police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed and firth conducts his own search so far so good just as hes about to give up he turns to his womanizing best friend billy zane and they stumble onto her former life in las sordid underground of drugs nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking and then to her history of mental instability at that point firths life is in danger and the film falls apart none of the characters from lisa zanes past are remotely interesting the film moves slowly and theres very little action there is a subplot regarding missing drug money but its just a throwaway no chases no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters one thing worth noting lisa zane and billy zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together by the end of the movie youre torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake
