you believe in god or you dont you believe in jesus or you dont you believe he is the son of god or you dont the choice is up to youbr br director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure social worker son of two humans instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary who opened heaven again for us encouraging the big bang a world come from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation the film depicts a theologian bringing some modern findings to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play who happily incorporates them in his playbr br the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy more often than not the directors abhorrence of the church is clearly visiblebr br the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus life and the passion play actors life this is an admirable attempt but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actors organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesusbr br my opinion is not important gods opinion is but i wouldnt want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus throne
