this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham redgraves character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with thurmans 20 something for the love of foxs character why is beyond me the title of the movie should have been shallow people on the lake the actors played like they were in a rehearsal a dreadfully predictable ending to boot i cant believe this is on this website as a comedy
