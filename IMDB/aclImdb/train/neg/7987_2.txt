im sure this was one of those woah attractions in 1982 when epcot opened but now its just silly the films message is clich√© the circlevision is disorienting and that awful song at the end is grating and i really wish theyd install seats after so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes and when you hear theres a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous you get entertained while sitting down right wrong youre standing there for 18 minutes leaning against a short little railing disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film not fun skip it in fact skip canada altogether unless youre eating there move directly to the united kingdom
