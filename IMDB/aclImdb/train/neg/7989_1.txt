i had high expectations following my beautiful laundrette bend it like beckham and less so east is east the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series goodness gracious me etc this one falls flat inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hillbr br ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort complete with strong regional accents whacky overacting characters a those were the days soundtrack and lots of issues in an attempt to be worthybr br i found myself cringing at many points during this film the writing is predictable every possible cliche was dragged out and aired in fact i have trouble thinking of any crossculturalcrossgenerational devices that could have been used that werent the characters were thin and cliched the eccentric nonconformist minister the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman the over weight overbearing aunt the pushy indian parents the working class neighbour the wise profound grandmother the motorbike riding thug the script was weak with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken and why it had to be set in the 70s apart from needing an excuse for a 70s soundtrack is a mystery possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979 i dont knowbr br even these things aside good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity instead the usual bbc comedy suspects were wheeled out to ham it up bend it like beckham had far better comic acting and serious acting in fact than this with a virtually unknown castbr br in summary a lazy cliched script over acted in a dull predictable story give it a missbr br
