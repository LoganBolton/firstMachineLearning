i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by maneating ants what i didnt remember was how awful it wasbr br i recently caught this movie on television late at night im sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again suzanne somers at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on threes company plays a vacationer at lakewood manor constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants nest or should i say a maneating ants nest one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants one minute hes picking them off his clothes one by one the next minute hes covered in them the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirtbr br if you thought that was pretty farfetched you should see myrna loy playing a wheelchair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the moviebr br the final scenes depict suzanne robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other blowing through straws and covered in antsbr br thats basically the movie theres really no disaster appeal or bigstar draw to the film it was intended to be a grandscale television event at the time now its lucky if it gets dumped in a 400am timeslot on your local television stationbr br if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best then watch an episode of threes company if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills then watch this moviebr br 010
