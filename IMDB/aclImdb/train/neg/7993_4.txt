this is another one of those humans vs insectsecohorror features a theme that was popular in the late 70s only you cant really call it horror theres zero suspense and no gruesome events in other words this movie is pretty lame its not that its really bad or something its just very boring a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants later on we learn that probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past their bite became poisonous some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out whats going on robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours then they flee in the house waiting to get rescued and man you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them i wont spoil too much but at one point they even use a big helicopter all the time when i was watching this i sat there thinking come on people you all got shoes on just run out of the building im sure a bunch of ants wont catch up with you its all pretty ridiculousbr br of course lots of closeups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie ants in the garden ants in the garbage ants in the kitchen ants on the roof ants in the bedroom ants in the sink and the best part ants crawling on peoples faces while the actors are breathing through straws but when you see groups of ants in wider shots they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wallbr br one small surprise came near the end no it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chieffireman ehrr what more can i say this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the boxart of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor there you have it now since this is a madefortv movie from the 70s ill be once again extremely mild in my final rating now the savage bees another humans vs insects tvmovie from 1976 was much better than this one i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants lacking suspense action thrills shocks and creepiness the only thing youll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch
