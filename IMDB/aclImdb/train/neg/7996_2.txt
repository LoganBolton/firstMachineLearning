is there a book titled how to make a movie with every man vs nature cliché imaginable if not ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects ants doesnt have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes the setup the characters the various subplots the death scenes and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases much better its amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because theyre all basically the same moviebr br and can someone please tell me what in gods name myrna loy is doing in this monkeyturd of a movie a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies
