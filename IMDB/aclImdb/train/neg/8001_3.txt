monster  he was great i loved the specialeffects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of the creature from the black lagoon the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jawdroppingbr br social commentary much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors under orders from the government state that sarslike disease is out there in a nutshell we get the familiar government coverup story you know i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt but it looks like the koreans are copying the format and its very tedious in here it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this monster it just drags the film down the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family presumed dead was hauled off by the creaturebr br moral a typical dont pollute the water message because this is what can happen  a horrible mutated monster this used to be the antinuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants spiders fish or whatever in those schlocky scifi films now its environmental issues that are the focusbr br the humor this was mostly stupid i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasnt funny i dont know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful or the film was purposely trying to be ultracorny with a take on the old godzilla movies lets hope its the latterbr br transfer  the video transfer was good this was a sharplooking picture and sound was decent with a lot rearspeaker crowd noise i watched this in korean with the english subtitles that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hourbr br overall  this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots which is inexcusable for a modernday monster film two hours was way too long for this story how this film drew record crowds in korea i dont know they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support
