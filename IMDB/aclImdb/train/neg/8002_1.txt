what a terrible movie rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too dont be fooled by the positive comments it wasnt scary it wasnt funny it wasnt clever it wont even hold your attention i just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crapfest the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained the dialogue was terrible must be a translation thing another negative that stood out was the idiot americans 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character intelligence and judgment now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10 the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter
