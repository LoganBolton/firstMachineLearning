dont be deceived as i was by the glowing reviews quoted on the dvd box wildly entertaining a seriously scary freakout and the worst of all on par with jaws this movie is none of the abovebr br normally i dont bother with writing bad reviews for films but i cant believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on imdb it doesnt deserve itbr br after a soso opening daylight attack by a monster created by what else chemicals dumped by lazy scientists this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly basically and improbably a girl is snagged by the monster ill give them points for a good creature design but this aint no weta creation and her semicomical family spend an hourandahalf tracking her downin the sewers surrounding the han river their search lacks any suspenseagain someone called this on par with jawsand by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless other than that a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stopbr br blech this was bad im not kidding you want to see a rotten monster movie rent deep rising at least youll save 30 minutes of your life
