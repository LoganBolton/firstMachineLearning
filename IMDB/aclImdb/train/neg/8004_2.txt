first of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done its a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment br br  spoilers below  br br from the opening scene we can see this movie is antiamerican normally this sort of stereotyping wouldnt bother me we brits get enough from hollywood but here its not subtle about making the americans braindead morons it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a yank has raped the directors motherbr br the grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhillbr br here we are introduced to the olympic medallist auntie and drunk uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisisbr br the whole virus sideline is ridiculous if the americans know there isnt a virus why are they wasting time money and resources investigating the us government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent korean for nothing making the americans look evil or stupid it wasnt helped by the fact this guy was crosseyed for comical effectbr br the movie is about hunting the monster us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although throughout the movie they are invisible the only people hunting the monster in the whole of korea is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day naturally a few uskorean agents try to stop them along the waybr br the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end it was clich√©d you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part and my final annoyance how the hell did that kid survive at the end the monster had been swimming with its head underwater for about 5 minutes why didnt the monster eat the kids in the first place
