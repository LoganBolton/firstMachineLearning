gwoemul the host  due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the beasts latest mealbr br firstly i love monster movies mutated bears oversized alligators packs of ravening komodo dragons the whole lot creature features are my favourite kind of horror film so i really wanted to like the host but it wasnt to be br br there were three major problems with itbr br the first can be seen with a quick look at its imdb pagebr br genre action  comedy  drama  fantasy  horror  scifi  thrillerbr br too many damned genres it took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement antipollution antiamerican or antigovernment the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mishmash with all the other stylesbr br secondly after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america apparently do nothing and thats it they just wander about occasionally hitting one another presumably for a bit of comedy relief this lack of action made my attention wander and apparently it did the same for the director as whole plot threads go unresolved a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about and is never resolvedbr br and lastly the film is clumsily political it paints the americans as being stupid and evil but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss the coroner not to pour chemicals into the han river the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on as well as being racist its lazy filmmaking and there is no excuse for thatbr br on the plus side the monster is good kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising some of the movement effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun there are also some nice shots in the film some of which remind me strangely of the way firefly was filmed shuddering cameras out of focus shots etcthere is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the familys mobile food stall its nighttime and snow is falling the streetlamp is giving out a cold light but the food stall has a warm glow coming from itbr br overall i was really disappointed by this film id been looking forward to a decent creature flick and instead i get some pseudopoliticalhorrorcomedy lite looking at the comments on imdb i cant help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated just cause its a foreign flick doesnt mean its any good there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood for example but this certainly isnt one of them br br for once im in favour of a remake tighten up the directing improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film as it is its not worth a couple of hours of anyones time
