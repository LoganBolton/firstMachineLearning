i really really didnt expect this type of a film outside of america how anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a thriller is just sick auteuil whom i had previously admired going around like some sort of childsaving rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the worldbr br whats doubly depressing is that the stunning and groundbreaking film happiness came out the year before this film menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves its admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there they were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch happiness to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophiliabr br do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor teacher friend or even a relative hmmi wonder if they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this buttonpushing crap 110
