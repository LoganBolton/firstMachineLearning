as a lesbian i am always on the lookout for films relating to gays  lesbians however with this kind of crap out thereit would be enough to discourage any audiencebr br i kept waiting for something to happenanythinga story to develop or just for it to make some kind of sense neither occurred it was just meaningless scenes unconnected in any way with anything the film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the characterbr br after an hour or more of this nonsense i simply turned it offbr br dont waste your time on this absurditybr br 1 star  and it doesnt even deserve that
