one would think that a film about a young persons coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring think again this production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because its about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market its almost as if the film maker considered making a movie but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random and randomly boring images and gonowhere scenes throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting pretend that good lighting inst important in the filmmaking process and wrap it up under the auspices of an arthouse film this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional filmmakers to poopoo the indie film movement and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie filmsbr br if youre interested in films covering this subject matter youd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logos website or renting get real better yet read stone butch blues whatever you do skip this longwinded piece of dreck
