about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel alasbr br those who like gus van sants films  especially his later ones  will probably like this personally i find van sants films to be dull pretentious and facile well he was an executive producer for this film so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him  although personally i actually liked this better than van sants latest efforts eg elephantbr br contrary to many here i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood  the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world  but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all but i feel that the problem with the film is that mood is not enough and not only that but that the mood painted here is to my mind incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening the dreamlike quality so closely linked to nature is beautifully captured here but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold waves on a beach grasses and flowers spiders etc the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life when you are caught up in a crush on someone  or being the object of bullying at school  you are anything but languorous there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the filmspoilers here  first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid  especially with no father present  seemed real to mebr br the second and only part of the film with any tension to it were the scenes where leah logans recreation of himself phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phonesex the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voiceover of leah was the most convincing actor in the entire film it made me think of claire danes from my socalled life the voice even sounded like claire she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along it was perhaps the best moment in the film as  finally  we got some character developmentbr br all in all a somewhat misplaced effort we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the directors possible talents in the meantime if he can get away from van sants influence it might do him a world of good who is this director anyhow  one of van sants boy toys
