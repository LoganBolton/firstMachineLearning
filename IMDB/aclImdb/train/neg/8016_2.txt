first of all this film is glacially slowmoving and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutesbr br the films subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themesbr br its unfortunate because in the hands of a writer like say lanford wilson i think symbolism like a mountainlion invading a school campus could take on great tragic proportions without being heavyhandedbr br i think with a good script supporting the film the same filmmaker with the same tastes and even with the same actors who didnt really even get a chance to impress me might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful crush on an older boy that he admiresbr br however im sorry to say that without this foundation and armed with a vague dullwitted and vastly uninteresting script without any sort of plot in sight and lacking any sort of sensible structure for example after viewing it i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes and instead will find yourself enumerating well maybe that scene or that one were climaxesthe result is 95 minutes of tediumbr br without a good plot we never get terribly interested in any of the characters their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boringbr br without a good plot dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the storyline i never really could believe for example the creation of leah and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmedbr br as the film stands im afraid its one i cannot recommend at all what i can never understand is why a film like this one isnt remade by an enterprising filmmakerinstead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release all it needs is a good script written by good writers and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male comingofage that is rarely treated in drama all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film the messages written on the boys belly the leah scenes the televisionscreen fantasies could become rich if underpinned with a good storylinebr br i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject and i think thats mistaken obviously the crush depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices and indeed in his depicted masturbation fantasies we see all sorts of stimuli sexual and nonsexual as we would expect in a very young boy like him i believe crushes such as logans are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sexpartners
