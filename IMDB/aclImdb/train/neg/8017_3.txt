i havent actually finished the film you may say that in this case i have no right to review it especially so negatively but i do only because i stopped it on account of i couldnt watch anymorei got over halfway and i only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner this film is so tiresome so lackluster that i was actually insulted i havent read many of the other reviews so im not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it but i am homosexual and i did go through similar revelations day dreams issues etc etc there were maybe two moments where i actually felt this film could go somewhere where i felt it may have some inkling of meaning or relativity but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of clichéridden narration came on i mean just look at the quotes on the imdb page unfortunately youre not able to hear the scratchy play back nor the echoey fades if youre just read the quotes because they are just too painfulridiculousstupid to miss i did give the film three stars and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform archers tired concepts into something watchable mind you i pray he wasnt the one who decided to include all the long shots of tv closeupsanother unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as korines gummo i think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at sundance only because archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did by the way because sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as arthouse no its not art house im afraid its just plain sthouse do not watch
