wow i hated this movie the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic but the script  if there even was a script  is a mess this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere id say it goes nowhere fast except that its actually the longest 81 minutes youll ever sit through as ive mentioned the lead actor is good so is faruza baulk sp as his sometimesharshbutultimatelylovingandaccepting mother the film makers have a lot to answer for here because this is a mess a real shamebecause i really wanted to like this movie but its basically outtakes from a movie that never got made skip this one  it wasnt even worth the 6 i shelled out for payperview
