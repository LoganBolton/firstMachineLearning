despite its stereotypes virtually noname cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright much better than i expected it to be i was skeptical at first  the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me but in the end i thought the film handled the concept well even if some scenes were a little clich√©dbr br the cast was quite good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously i couldnt help thinking though that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis lookalike maybe its just her face or the makeup hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole timebr br while its not a must see or a great film by any standard fatal error is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end
