had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsyfartsy tosstogether with no direction or resolution how do these people get through film school who gives them money to make this crap could have been so much more fine lead actor and i always like fairuza balk but come on the altrock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired and it sure doesnt make for good films the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say this is like the throwspaghettiatthewall school of artmaking just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges that can work if the director actually has any kind of vision or has a brain that knows when its in the presence of potential but here its just space filler of no consequence i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit and was yelling you lazy bastard at the screen when the credits popped up
