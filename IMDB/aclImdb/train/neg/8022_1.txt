i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot besides the sexual scenes which bordered on childporn which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically i would liken this movie to a recipe thats been torn in half its kind of like being handed a list of ingredients with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product from the start character development and story development are lackingunfortunately many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think ahhokfinally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going onorwho this character isor maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character moreor understand and get involved more with this intercharacter relationshipetc but no such luck on the contrary many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled only to find that whatever miniplot within whatever miniplot and that poorly presented was just a ruse why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 212 stars another mystery its not that the characters arent likable to some degree or that you cant identify with them or their humanness at allits just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someones film school project i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half
