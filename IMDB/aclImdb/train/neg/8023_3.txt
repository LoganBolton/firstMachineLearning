after watching this movie on dvd i watched the trailer the voiceover describes the movie as surreal well theres surreal and theres surreal br br there was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me but frankly it was more confusing than surreal the other unusual imagery particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor were so nonsensical they had no meaning i dont mind imagery that doesnt mean anything but these scenes just seemed irrelevantbr br my impression is that the director was trying to convey logans inner monologue i dont know what else would explain what was going on unfortunately nothing i saw gave me any clue what logan was thinking about what his perspective was or even his emotional state all i could tell was that he wasnt particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy br br i thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become but not much else did purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision br br still as tiresome and as contentfree the movie was for me it was a definite change of pace i very much liked madagascar skin and i had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative and perhaps even style it didnt even come close for me theres no question about it this movie deserves an a for effort but a d for execution
