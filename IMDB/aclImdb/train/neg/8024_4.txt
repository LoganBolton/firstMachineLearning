sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lackingbr br on the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a seasonlong realitydrama dating show jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesnt just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancé or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the womens actions the women are super competitive while they dont even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the costbr br not only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women werent there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses  either lowcut or shortbr br while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situationsbr br so a reality dating show couldnt be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sexdriven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someones attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the sidebr br another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i dont get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they dont even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminatedbr br michelle in particular seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle outburst vienna asserted that michelle had a mental breakdown and weve only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show  narrowly missing elimination  and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminatedbr br it began with survivor and from there it just took off  reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we werent watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing trappingsbr br this begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds im not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to evaluate each onebr br episodes used for critique season premier and episode 2
