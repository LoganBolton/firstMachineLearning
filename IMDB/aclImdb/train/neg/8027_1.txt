i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you cant believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and dvdbr br so if want to see a horrormovie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area
