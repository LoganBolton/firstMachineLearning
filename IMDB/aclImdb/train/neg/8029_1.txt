a friend of mine bought this very cheaply and decided to give it to me as a birthday present i thought id never watch it cause i knew it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic but then my friends and i got really bored and watched it from start till finish i know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece its hard to describe you should see it its a real lesson on what people are capable of when they believe theyre creative and smart and really arent the acting is sousterrain you can actually see the leading lady laugh on some occasions shes definitely the worst the story is to stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucked please pay special attention to the sheriff the guy is an adult and therefor has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this hes extremely bad as well whatever it did have some hilarious moments check it out haha
