not too keen on this really the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing i enjoyed the first 10 minutes bill nunns good after that it was pretty appalling tim doesnt fit the role he comes across as a smug self inflated ass  pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player its a idealist film and as a musician feel slightly offended after watching it theres no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates hes completely self indulgent i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character maybe im watching the wrong film if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle
