i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaptionbr br although its been years since i read the story the first time the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous very important elements which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to badbr br if the plot sounds interesting to you go and get the novel its much much much betterbr br still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich
