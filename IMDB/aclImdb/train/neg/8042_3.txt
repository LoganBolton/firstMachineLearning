the secret isthis movie blows sorry but it just did br br spoilerbr br in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream beth played admirably by dorie barton joins several friends on a spring break trip the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation then the deaths begin first one then another then another of the friends is murdered leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results br br one note dorie barton is the poor mans reese witherspoonÂ–she looks like reese acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police lineup maybe thats how they cast her anyhoo decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing
