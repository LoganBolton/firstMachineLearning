suppose youve been on a deserted island the last ten years havent heard of scream and left when halloween part 1 entered the cinema then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scenebr br at the moment a 27 rating is on imdb and it doesnt deserve a that low appreciation slashing all the way like i know what you did and a whoisit that when getting to the end convinced me of that whoandwhybr br no big surprise just a nice flick to watch with a cola popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot deep characters if the video rental is out of the top titles you can take it without a risk but dont expect a masterwork ive seen a lot worse
