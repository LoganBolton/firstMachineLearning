oh dear what a horrid moviebr br the production was so cheap and nasty remember the shot from the natural where the lightning hits the tree leaving a glowing stump that roy hobbs makes a bat from well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the housebr br i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural or did they just hope that noone who would watch the film would pick it up br br then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck such overacting in the cabin br br a really bad film a really bad film
