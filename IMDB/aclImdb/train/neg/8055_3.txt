the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may olivera person too talented for this film didnt like wheelera sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friendswhich greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastimebr br i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywoodthe silent era through the 1940s i have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey i cant help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brothers film duck soup yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp at times woolsey talked a bit like groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny in fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality was that he looked goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sang very poorly a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as whos on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routineso prematurely that you are left frustrated i knew that whos on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twistbr br once again i have found yet another subpar film by this duo while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly such as silly billies and the rainmakerswhich i actually gave 6s to on imdb this one was a major endurance test to completesomething that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey where was all the humor
