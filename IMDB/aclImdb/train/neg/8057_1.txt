whats wrong with this film many many things the editing tries too hard to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying himher with a powerful headache the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short story or film the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film we all know what happens to things when we stretch them right exactly they get thinner in the end the plot is just so paperthin that you might even miss it if you arent paying attention which is hard to do when watching this movie the acting is not even slightly impressive the characters are poorly written and dull uninteresting one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently whoever was in charge of the scoresoundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it was supposed to be aboutnot that i blame him i couldnt figure it out either as a result half of the music in the film doesnt fit the scenes at all also what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character naturally this was in order to attract young males but it was just so cheaply done and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film on any conceivable level at all the two creepy guys didnt seem to have anything to do with the film at all they were just there in order to have some chase scenes i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywoodlike attempt at a somewhat interesting idea but i digress i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who dont mind a really bad horrorthriller as long as theres some sex and gore in italthough that may only be true for the killer cut which i saw 110
