having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead of all movies havent seen that one yet but considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever safe to say i made the wrong choice there is simply nothing to recommend this movie and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut it didnt even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend it simply made no sense held no excitement had very little interesting acting or compelling writing the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running and the reason is obvious the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly to meaningless effect get wrong turn instead if you want to see dushku i would like to see a movie with her and the superhot elisabeth harnoisbut i dont think even that would have made this movie watchable casey affleck so promising in good will hunting is awful herehe seems to lack both intelligence and guts thats enough on this one
