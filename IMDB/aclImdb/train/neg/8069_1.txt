an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track soul survivors is the latest entry in the whos dead and whos alive genre of horror films two teenaged couples sean and cassie and matt and annabel prepare to go off to different colleges but before they part until thanksgiving break they attend one last fling at a ravetype party in some burntout church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty annabel eliza dushku aka faith the other vampire slayer motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to cassie the generic melissa sagemiller for reasons that are never explained and before long the quartet leave the party driving away in their suv they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway causing a nasty and fatal accident as the suv flips over an embankment and plunges into a river sean is killed or is he and cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt she was driving when shes not being haunted by seans ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys much unexplained incoherence follows as cassies mental state degenerates further until we reach the predictable conclusion so who is dead and who is alive after ninety minutes of this purgatory who actually cares
