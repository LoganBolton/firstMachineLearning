a possible spoiler or two br br  soul survivors is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever nothing makes sense at all theres some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that dont really tie together by the end of the film br br  tha acting is nonexistent the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing it just makes the movie even harder to watchbr br  i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came definitely the worst film of the year 12 stars
