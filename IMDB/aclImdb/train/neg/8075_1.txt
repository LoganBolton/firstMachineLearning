final score 18 out of 10br br after seeing jay and silent bob strike back i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie soul survivors is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick  even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young upandcomers like dushku wes bentley american beauty casey affleck drowning mona and likable star melissa sagemiller luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the brainchild of writerdirector stephen carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of open your eyes or vanilla sky and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accidentdeath the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i dont think these movies are that entertaining by their very nature to begin with but ss is rockbottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this plus its pg13 so it doesnt even deliver the gore or ta to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between dushku  sagemiller as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene  at least i would get something out of this then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off thats it people thought this was hot soul survivors is one of those dropdead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenters finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and thats probably the most lively part it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the scifi channel due to its low cost and pg13 rating  and thats probably best for it
