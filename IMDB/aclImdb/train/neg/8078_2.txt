the world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart yes its solar crisis aka crisis 2050 which burned up a huge chunk of change thats never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video remember them in a reedited version credited to one alan smithee the plot hooks pretty much the same as sunshine  suicide mission to the sun saboteur on board logic cast adrift  except that this time theyre not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach earth with a talking bomb voiced by paul williams who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously given that the cast also includes jack palance at his most dementedly ott charlton heston at his most rigid topliner tim matheson at his most anonymous the original hills have eyes unforgettable michael berryman you may not remember the name but you do remember that face and peter boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because er if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down youd expect if not a laughaminute at least a laugh every reel no joy this is the worst kind of bad movie a boring one the fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace theres lowkey and theres walking through it but here the cast dont even do that instead they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time you keep on hoping for paul williams talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis but instead the film just stands there doing next to nothing literally this is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if clive owen had been cast hed almost have looked lively by comparison even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves yep the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world merchantivory films have better action scenesbr br things arent much livelier down on earth where the movie spends most of its running time with mathesons sonchucks grandson corin nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with palances insane desert artist looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me while waylaid by rejects from a mad max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can release him on a nice beach just dont expect logic if you havent already guessed that much best moment a ditzy girl in a bar describing jack palance as an old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather though chucky baby taking out the villains aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99 of its running time offers a whole lot of nuttin richard c sarafians slightly longer original cut that played in japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes the director of vanishing point must have thanked his lucky stars when the reedit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film a film so bad its not good and painfully unfunny with it
