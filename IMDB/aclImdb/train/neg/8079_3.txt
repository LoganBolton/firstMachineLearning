yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash canbr br boring direction and performances with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material and the ever earnest charlton heston earn the rating of a real stinkerbr br its amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is he even plays in a subplot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie the way they ended up resolving it was that they didnt it simply falls off the endbr br really dont waste your time on this one
