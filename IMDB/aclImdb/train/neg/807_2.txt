i didnt expect much from this tv movie you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr still it managed to disappoint failing even to be a goodbad filmbr br every scene was by rote as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script leaned back and said my work is done its all cliche all predictable and even worse the actors are forced to look like theyre taking it seriously even when the plot developments are laughablebr br do yourself a favor watch the xfiles if youre in the mood for paranoia they handle it better also let anyone know that sitting through fatal error is just that
