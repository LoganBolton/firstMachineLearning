one of the requirements of science fiction at least before it starts to become satire is that it be somewhat plausible i would think that an antimatter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended but ill leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisisbr br it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand theyre getting close to earth so much so that its become unseasonably hot as if the entire earth were death valley the answer is an antimatter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing its not in direct alignment with the earth br br who to deliver it but captain tim matheson and his crew that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son corin nemec taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston mathesons father and nemecs grandfatherbr br theres a villain here too peter boyle who is the ceo of a multinational corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the worlds food supply for the survivors the idea he might not survive doesnt enter into his thinking hes doing his best to sabotage mathesons missionbr br solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman apparently hes the only one in the cast who realizes hes in a turkey and overacts accordinglybr br the rest of the cast are stalwart true blue and dull except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him br br the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films allen smithee the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving
