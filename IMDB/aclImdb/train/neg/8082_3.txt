it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldnt have beenbr br the movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient  a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff  the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that onebr br i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing
