i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive dvdvideolaserdisc collection so luckily i didnt personally have to pay for it i had an inkling that it would be a bad film but i know what a truly bad film is after watching greats like children shouldnt play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixedup zombies and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly badbr br solar crisis is bad but it doesnt reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are atbr br anyway the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it in order to counteract this imminent threat humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb which the opening describes as the biggest explosive ever into the sun which through some convoluted scifi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle leaving earth unharmedbr br never mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek even with an ensemble cast charlton heston peter boyle and jack palance solar crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity thanks to a plot that starts simple yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears onbr br the crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character played by boyle who insists on sabotaging the mission through means that are never explained he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crews genetically engineered scientist played by female lead annabel schofield why is he sabotaging the mission because by his moronic viewpoint he believes the flare wont happen and that when it doesnt he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market in effect you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginablebr br the films plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention but i am sitting here writing this review on microsoft word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages and i would only succeed in losing your interest but then again you would probably get the same effect from watching the filmbr br anyway the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters spewed scifi jargon back and forth at eachother yes i know they already do that but imagine if thats all they did and that they used said jargon to set up vague and nearnonsensical scenes that produce no excitement tension or interest in the viewer whatsoeverbr br this is best exemplified at the point when a character in a zerog environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding the script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion but doesnt bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs nor why he cant really escape in totality you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughablebr br then we have several scenes where dramatic buildup leads to nothing jack palances performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero dont ask around the desert before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits on his deathbed palance finally tells our boy hero his last name while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball which he kept quiet about before colonel travis j richards the boy repeats it quietly after he expires giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film perhaps charlton hestons grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated something anythingbr br nope sorry any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic failed attempts at creating dramaÂ—for a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on palances career just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marredbr br completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villains spell a climax which features another of the films considerably welldone visual effects sequences that even for the visibly elaborate care put into them still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind boyle heston and palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure overactingbr br grade d
