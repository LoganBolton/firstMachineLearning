oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad its good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain badbr br for a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and hell be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess whatjust like in dark star the bomb has a malfunctionhmmmm add in a dash of we cant act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshellbr br light relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him upeventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short hes the best bit of the moviebr br my award for the most ironic line delivered straightfaced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corsetbr br also amusing is the bad guys top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reasonbr br apart from these hilarities theres little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from 2001br br tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i didbr br 1 any time the bomb speaks imagine its called tarquin trust me it worksbr br 2 whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak preempt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similarbr br 3 whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that shes having an aneurism and will die soonbr br 4 during the interminable the ships broke again scenes keep hoping the techengineer guys will spout a scottyism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crapbr br other than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadnt missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so dont worry about tuning out for a few you wont miss anything
