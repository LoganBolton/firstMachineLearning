when i had first heard of solar crisis then got a load of the cast i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before then i saw itbr br now i knowbr br for a movie that encompasses outer space the sun vast deserts and sprawling metropolises this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera wont have to pull too far backbr br and the effects while good are pretty underwhelming were talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare but other than shouting sweating and a red glow about everything theres no real feel of emergencybr br dont get me started about the cast what heston palance matheson boyle et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyones guess makes you wonder who elses condos arent paid for in hollywoodbr br and as far as the end goes well lets just say its tense and intriguing but its too little too late in an effort like this if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film maybe i would have heard of solar crisis soonerbr br two stars mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves br br i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this
