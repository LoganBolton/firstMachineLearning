extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novelbr br what was even worse was marlon brandos performance his southern drawl was ridiculous i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost brando so great in previous films was reduced here to a laughing stock tyrone power in witness for the prosecution should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando herebr br the film dealing with racism dealt with the us governments attempt to avoid marriages between us soldiers and japanese womenbr br brando was stonefaced throughout the movie his moving from antithese relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new viewsbr br only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances nothing about either performance was equally impressive umekis appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka who did nicely as brandos love interest she showed great emotion as the antiamerican who found love with the brando character her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11 she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was livingbr br martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in the ten commandments to the bigoted mother of brandos love interest at first her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted patricia owens as brandos first love showed depth and conviction in her performance
