this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co br br i really wanted this film to be good really really im a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast wellcrafted plots 3dimensional characters and the best film music sincewellever this film just doesnt come closebr br might as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazakis later films and the english voice acting is quite well donebr br but this filmjustisntgood the characters are all cardboard  from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once youve seen each of them for 30 seconds youve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesnt helpbr br then theres the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesnt do him justice half the music is 80s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picturebr br but wait theres a great message with this film right lets all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i aint kiddingbr br it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lamebr br if youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys 80s music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
