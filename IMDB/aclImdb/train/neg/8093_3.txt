based on tom wolfes satirical novel that was praised by all i have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs eithermelanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the filmthis will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten3
