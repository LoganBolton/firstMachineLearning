most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters they rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happenbr br if i hadnt read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film it didnt make you care about the characters like them or dislike them it turns the characters into jokesbr br awfulbr br ridiculousbr br waste of two hours of my life
