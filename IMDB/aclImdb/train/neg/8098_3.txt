this is one of the most atrocious rewrites ive ever viewed if they want to make a movie with a lousy story they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book there is hardly a relation between wolfes book and this movie other than the title i dont mind changes if they help a story flow on screen at least the changes shouldnt hurt the final product the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing the actors are miscast the director andor screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermonbr br if youve seen this movie and disliked it try the book if youve seen this movie and liked it read the book
