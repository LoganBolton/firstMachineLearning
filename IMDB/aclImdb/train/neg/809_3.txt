i was expecting a little something from k911 i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into i always did love the dog comedy movies but it looked like it was supposed to be james movie not jerry lees the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didnt have chemistry to begin with not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasnt going in that direction james just really ticked me off for more than half the film the dogs were the true stars and thats pretty sad that they out shined the actorsbr br so im glad its not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie but hopefully james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one no offense but not everyone can be their star sibling dont you wish ashlee simpson would take that same advice d br br 310
