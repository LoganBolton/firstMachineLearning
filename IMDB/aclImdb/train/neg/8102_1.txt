oh i heard so much good about this movie went to see it with my best friend shes female im male now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream after the first couple of dozen take off your clothes we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom we laughed at it not with it we dozed and would have been better off staying in bed we were convinced we had spent money in vain and we had the plot was incoherent and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care a waste of money a waste of celluloid this movie doesnt even deserve one out of ten votes but thats the lowest available im not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent i dont recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence
