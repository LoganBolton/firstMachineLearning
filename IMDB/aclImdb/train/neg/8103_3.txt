this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i dont care what the critics say its bad i think the problem is with kunderas novel its not that its unfilmable its just that like 99 of his work its pretentious and overdrawn he seems to be enamored with himselfhis characters come off as navelgazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works even his socialist realist poetry that was truly awful  i just dont understand what the fuss is about characteristics like the selfabsorption in his novels make for infuriating reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified maybe i just missed something but i dont think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd no way is this movie that essential
