yeah cheap shot i know but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of deepness political turmoil lovelust can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim see also american beauty kaufmans movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences in one scene i counted three different generic european accents affected by the actors and displays of state might run amok yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered and in its overlong three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franzthe missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot and in this manner sacrifices the novels central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas son used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel combined with the overweening soundtrack these flaws make this movies three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content
