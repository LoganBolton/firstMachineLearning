harsh yes but i call em like i see embr br i saw this in the late 80s and it was truly one of the most awful boring films ive ever forced myself to watchbr br yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories eg dr zhivago qv this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interestingbr br sure olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow im all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my miserybr br im sure if id read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however lifes too short to expend any more time on this one
