seriously why do american and frech actors pretending to be czechs need to speak perfect english with a fake russian accent i am a man so i enjoyed the gratuitous nuditybut a soft porn flick would have more of that and at least wouldnt pretend its artisticbr br all the political statements where painfully didactic has the director heard of subtlety the acting was also woody and melodramatic and the comic relief was never funny the characters were very shallow and i just couldnt identify with them at allbr br the bit where i did laugh was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in prague  and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footagejust ludicrousbr br i read many of kunderas short stories not the unbearable lightness of being and there are good things about his style of writing although his themes are one big male fantasyand i have to say the film did not convey any of the goodness of kunderas style
