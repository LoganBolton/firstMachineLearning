 contains spoilers br br i did not like this movie at allbr br i found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes given that eventually we have to die how should we approach life in a light way like tomas in a heavy way like tereza or should we find ways not to face that question like sabina how much is fidelity important in a relationship how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our countrybr br unfortunately i havent read kunderas novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginningbr br i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece i simply dont see the reasons why what i see are many flaws and a sample of them followsbr br 1 the three main characters are thrown at you and its very hard to understand what drives them when making their choicesbr br 2 the secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they dont add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessarybr br 3 i did not like how tomas was impersonated nothing is good for him he is so selfcentered and selfish he is not human in some sense but when his selfconfidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone i did not find the interpretation crediblebr br 4 its very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968 on top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions which sounds strange to me a how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeedbr br 5 the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable and i am not even mother tongue moreover the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech which i found very inconsistentbr br 6 many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered i guess that most of the movie was shot on location so its not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look goodbr br 7 i found the ending sort of trivial tereza and tomas finally happy in the countryside far away from the temptations of the metropoly distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living detached from their professional lives die in a car accident but they die after having realized that they are happy indeed so what had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different i dont think so i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audiencebr br 8 the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters you see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing you dont feel empathy you dont relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to saybr br 9 i hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot why sabina has got such a strong reaction why franz agrees with her i really dont see the point the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality thats it whats so special and unique about itbr br after all these negative comments let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot thats why i gave it a twobr br the naked women photoshoot where the envy the jealousy and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presentedbr br the other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians tereza pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague are used to identify the people taking part to the riots i found it quite original and terezas sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayedbr br finally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that tomas types are going to like it and tereza ones are going to hate it if this is the case i strongly doubt it though then my comment should be revised drastically
