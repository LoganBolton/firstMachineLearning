i think phillip kaufman read the cliffs notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film okay of course it wont have the punch of the original kunderas novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs this film does not even try the one dream sequence of terezas so vital to the atmosphere of the book is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever also and this is perhaps a lesser point daniel daylewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this i know its not really a valid complaint but hey a perfect example of the hollywoodizing of otherwise fine literature
