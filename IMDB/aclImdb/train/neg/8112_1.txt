hannabarbera sucks the life out of another famous property the violence is watered down the stories are formulaic the animation is bad the music is obnoxious and repetitive and frankly the show just isnt funnybr br at the time hb put every one of its series through the same clich√©d situations regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not thus popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen hey popeye is popular and the flinstones are popular put em together and you cant miss also in an apparent ripoff of private benjamin olive oyl and the goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits seriously why br br adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode standard practice at the time for cartoons but still annoying popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely recycling and  are you ready for this  the dangers of smoking i swear im not making that upbr br the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack mercer the voice of popeye from the early days continues the role herebr br worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old fleischer shorts otherwise avoid at all costs
