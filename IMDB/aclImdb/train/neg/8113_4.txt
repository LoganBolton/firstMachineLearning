popeye and big foot  popeyes engine company  getting popeyes goat 12br br i used to lap these up as a kid but catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons backtoback now ie several years later they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas 1953 i can see how they dont hold up all that well the character of popeye isnt exactly sympathetic to begin with olive oyl distinctly overbearing and blutos antics failed to elicit much interest either  in short the scripts were alarmingly thin fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot theyre strictly juvenile fare yet i doubt todays kids would even have the patience to stick with them furthermore the animation style is unattractivebr br taking each short per se i guess they improved from one to the other after the initial shock one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief hardly original i know but always an amusing ploy one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience
