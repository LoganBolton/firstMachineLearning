 mainly because juon 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes worth of material literally taken straight out of the first juon  and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes that leaves you with 36 original minutes worth of film hohum i found that deeply irritating  as if viewers simply wouldnt remember the same stuff  not to mention dull having to watch it all over againbr br ok that complaint aside the byline for juon 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie which frankly over 36 minutes simply doesnt go far enough to making any kind of sense of the originals highly convoluted storylinebr br there are however some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been had it had some time to develop and some of the questions raised by the original  some but not all  are answeredbr br so in conclusion  if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story go for it  but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fastforward button for forty minutes
