this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didnt have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was decentbut i found the acting terrible the exception was marianne jeanbaptiste i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my lifebr br i apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion
