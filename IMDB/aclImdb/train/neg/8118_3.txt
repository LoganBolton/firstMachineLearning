well eyeboy i must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do my favorite part of your post was but no big bangbang goodguy badguy here kimosabe me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bangbr br well said i do like action movies especially if they are well done but i also like movies that dont have a whole lot of action as long as they are well done im sorry but secrets and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie i really dont see very many nonamerican films so maybe i was spoiled and didnt realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb hmm if true that is very scarybr br jeremy barger bitsmidohionetnew email
