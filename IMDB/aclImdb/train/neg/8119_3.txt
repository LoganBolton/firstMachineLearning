first of all there wasnt really anything in this movie that grabbed me really it wasnt a bad movie just another movie where i said well that wasnt anything special after id seen it there was probably drama and stuff but it simply didnt grab me but more seamed semidull as i said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way the quality of the film itself the images seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tvmovie than a well respected english filmmaker the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion didnt really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes i havent seen many english films and the ones ive seen didnt really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work colors and such game tried to be more cool hip  smart see my review of lola rennt about this if you wish but didnt succeed for me either overall just a little indifferent movie that wasnt anything special at best im afraid and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted
