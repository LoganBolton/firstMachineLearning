at least among those movies with 100 votes or more nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role nominated for best picture i always disagree with many of the oscar picks but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy the writing and acting were both horrible blethyns perfomance in particular was one of the worst ive ever seen and probably the most overrated acting performance of all time awful movie not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it including hbowhere i saw it i am only thankful i didnt actually pay to see one of the most overrated movies of all time
