spoilerswow this is a bad one i did a double take when watching an old star trek episode the other dayit was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nutsand there was stewart moss aka the unlikable hero of it lives by night he played the first crewmember infected who dies from terminal depression all i could think was that hed watched his own movie too many times thats what caused the depression this movie is full of truly unlikable people there is no redeeming character in the film not one its very hard to feel bad about dr becks turning into a bator whatever he actually turned into because you just dont like him and you dont like his shrill bony wife or the nasty sleazy sgt ward or dr mustache loveso why would you invest any time or energy in this movie where there is no empathy with the characters there is no reason to bother caring about it not to mention the horrible cinematography which made it look like theyd filmed the movie through urine and the five cent bat special effects many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying not the worst film ive ever seen on mst3k but down there in the bottom ranks definitely
