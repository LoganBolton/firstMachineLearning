i didnt think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you cant sleep although admittedly its no better quality than that its true that the acting isnt great  i thought marianne mcandrew as cathy beck for example came across as completely passionless  but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didnt really make sense to me the becks are on a trip described by john stewart moss as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had now thats romantic the work part has something to do with touring caves which in itself sounds strange how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyones work but it gets stranger when we find out that hes a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine huh that connection completely lost me bitten by a bat while hes in the cave he begins to transform into what i guess was supposed to be a humanbat hybrid although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an apeman of some sort and a killing spree starts heres another problem the first killing is a nurse in a hospital at first everyone thinks her death was an accident the second murder is of a young girl who is described as having her throat ripped out the sheriff michael pataki then tells us that her death was similar to the nurses meaning throat ripped out  how could anyone think that was an accident and whats with the sheriff he seems pretty nononsense until the scene in cathys hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her after which everything seems to go back to normal its saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved and also with one of the most irritating theme songs ive ever heard in a movie even for all that there was something here that kept me watching sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half pretty bad yeah  but not as awful as some people say
