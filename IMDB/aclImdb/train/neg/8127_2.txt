currently this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever madewhich is exactly why i rented it from netflix however i am saddened to report that the film while bad is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one hardly a glowing endorsement but it just didnt meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous listbr br the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way they are married in real life as well hes a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave once there they behave very very very stupidly hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat according to this film bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the usboth of which are not true at allbr br oddly after being bitten the man doesnt even bother going to the hospital the first thing on anyones mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately but not this boob soon hes having seizuresyet he still isnt interested in seeking help again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history br br after a while he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital but by then its too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood when its totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine the wife who like her husband has a grapefruit for a brain refuses to believe hes dangerouseven after he attacks people steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road br br now most of the time moss is going through these episodes his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person oddly however a couple times he develops batlike hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite batlike had this been really cheesy the film would have merited a 1br br in the very end in a twist that hardly made any sense at all the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss and mcandrews belief that this film would somehow help their careersthough they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974br br overall very dumb the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real not a good film at all but not among the worst films of all time eitherbr br note for some reason imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for its alive and its two sequels of the web page for the bat people while the bat people has been seen with the title its alive the two movies are not at all related its easy to understand the mistakeespecially since they both came out in 1974 but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell
