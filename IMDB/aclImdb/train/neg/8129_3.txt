i dunno sometimesyou try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved bat people which i saw under the title it lives by night is just such a movie you cant watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on night gallery and not one of the better ones either br br the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a werebat who drinks human blood actually youd think if he was turning into a real bat hed be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket but because this is a cheap lurid horror movie bloods the word in spite of the fact that he has grandmal seizures at the drop of a hat and blackout episodes almost every night his friend and fellow physician dr mustache aspenextreme insists that hes just having an allergic reaction to the rabies shots meanwhile the worlds most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls and one wino also meanwhile the doctors wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction br br its not so much that the acting is bad  you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script even the guy who plays the sheriff okay it is pretty bad but its bad in a clichéd wooden professional way its just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involvedbr br i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky unsettling little cult favorite butbr br 1the director needed to beat michael pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until pataki agreed to act and not just channel dennis weaver br br 2he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole bat bites human who then turns into a bat scenario br br 3 he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episodes instead of resorting to man has a seizure page from the little golden book of clichéd acting mannerisms br br 4 he needed to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant br br i would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of mike and the bots its bad but it isnt bad in a silly humorous or interesting way still better than battlefield earth or waterworld though
