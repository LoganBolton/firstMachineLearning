while exploring some caves with his wife a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effectsbr br occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent though under used makeup effects dont save this b horror flick from being a subpar tale of manbecomescreature the bat people aka it lives by night suffers from its senseless story thats awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing the plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens or even a satisfying conclusion for it all the cast is fairly mediocre in their performancesbr br still i give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too but it doesnt get much of a showcase here a missed opportunity for sure br br definitely one of the lesser mancreature flicks out therebr br  12 out of
