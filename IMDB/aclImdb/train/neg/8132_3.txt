really the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by the bat people is some of the most effective ever there are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves that alone is enough to be unsettling imagine all of them swarming after you and they do indeed swarm in what should have been a showstopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs the problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film most of which consists of one or more people running around screaming waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacationbr br the fear is that he is coming down with rabies which does indeed suck so their vacation is ruined as the plot synopsis on the top of the bat peoples reference page does indeed point out so here is an effective summary of the movie a young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat they bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving trying to convince those around him that its a bit more involved than rabies that he cant control himself and they everyone should keep awaybr br now when some one is frothing at the mouth covered with sweat eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper muppets and screaming at you to get away from me you get away from him you dont try to give him drugs you dont try to tell him you love him you give the guy his space go home and try that scenic getaway next yearbr br but no the people in this movie all behave like morons insist on pushing the guy to his brink and he flips out mutates into a part man part bat type creature and kills a bunch of nonessential secondary characters nothing wrong with that but the movie forgets that its a low budget creature feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study instead of a monster movie we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected pricebr br the main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes thirty tops and the movie should have been about the guy after he had turned into a bat person rather than about the journey there it takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining michael pataki as a small town cop whos lost his moral edge and the late paul carr as a physician friend who doesnt quite get the messagebr br the movie is dreadfully boring about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice forgettable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the italian horror favorite ratman which i watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing me and my bright ideas though the scene with the cop car was a howler too bad we couldnt have had another twenty minutes of thatbr br 310
