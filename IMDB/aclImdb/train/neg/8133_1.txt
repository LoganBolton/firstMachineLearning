the movie is just as fun as staring at the sunsheriff pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all that so called blood which in reality seemed like fruit punchbr br most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a moviethe rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time the ending was awful the outlines were cheesy and the scenes were terrible what else more should i say to you viewers out there my advice would be to get your rabies shot if youve already watched the movie this movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you didnt get your uptodate shots
