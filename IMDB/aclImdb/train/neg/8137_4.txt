stewart moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his headimagine the auditions for thiscan youno thats not quite it thank you next anyway hes bitten by a bat and then hes either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people orhes not for no one else sees his strange transformations but he himself seems to think that hes changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws etc to its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether hes just nuts or whether hes actually transforming into something until almost the very end this has some good locations  sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting kind of fun in a so bad its good way but leans more towards just plain bad 4 out of 10
