the bat people is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100 every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars but it always reliably returns sooner or later and why because unlike the majority of crap in that list the bat people is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz this nearly isnt the worst film ever made since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity but its still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing the script is incredibly boring with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film other than a sensible screenplay the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the makeup effects  although courtesy of a young stan winston  are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film the films title is inaccurate as people refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person much more than bruce wayne the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine batcave and a batmobile a stolen ambulance the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoonweekend exploring caves they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animals vicious attack worried that he might be infected with rabies he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital but still this doesnt prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment sure honey the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of batguano so basically the bat people is a variation on the good old werewolftheme but obviously not a very interesting one the concept showed a lot of potential but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy theres a nice bit of gore during the climax finally and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at though not to listen to this truly bad and boring films current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region the list simply wouldnt feel and traditional without the bat people
