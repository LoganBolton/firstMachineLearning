the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands but she is speaking german to him the 2 languishes are completely different its like saying well he takes french commands and start talking spanishbr br james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest the role just doesnt fit him even if its mend to be a comedybr br to many stereotypepredicable stuff typical comment or comebacksbr br if you dont look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv but i wouldnt suggesting renting it
