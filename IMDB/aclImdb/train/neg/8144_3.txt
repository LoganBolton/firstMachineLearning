i just saw this at the 2006 vancouver international film festival the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out im sorry to say i was very disappointedbr br besides being poorly written it was boring i wont take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad scriptbr br first bite was clich√© without being ironic over the top seriousness without being funny the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film i cant recommend this film it felt too long and all in all just plain weak
