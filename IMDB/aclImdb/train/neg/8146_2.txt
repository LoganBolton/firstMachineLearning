1st watched 1172002  2 out of 10dirjohn bianco pretty lame gangster movie about a godfatherlike family in brooklyn who like to say fourletter words a lot and kill people the only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang this is the only attempt at good filmmaking the rest of the movie was predictable and cheaplymade the quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your dvd player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound the acting was prettymuch characatures of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like vinnie knuckles and jimmie tattoos and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well so go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one
