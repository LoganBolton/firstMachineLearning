what an absolute pile of pants having read chris brookmyres books religiously since i came across quite ugly i was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissionedbr br i obviously had too much faith br br nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show  and even he doesnt quite fit how anyone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond mebr br entire characters are changed situations are dropped and to see parlablanes dramatic breakin reduced to nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window it brought tears to my eyesbr br i dread to think whats going to happen with country of the blind if this is the benchmarkbr br please just avoid it
