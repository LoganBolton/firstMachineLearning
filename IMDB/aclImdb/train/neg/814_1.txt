this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie clich√© is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didnt touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess theyre saving those old chestnuts for dooleys next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooleys prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs
