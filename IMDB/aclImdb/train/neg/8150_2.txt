if you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so then its ok to watch this its not all that bad really yeah its got more lapses in logic than i care to describe here and might tax the patience of people  like myself i have to admit  who are inclined to throw things at the tv on occasion but its funny at least just because its not always intentionally funny theres no need to let that get you downbr br however if youve read the book  or any of the other books by brookmyre  then youd probably best avoid it ive read them all and when i first watched this film i despised it ive trashed it in detail and at great length on another site in fact the tv plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful and admittedly rabid brookmyre fansbr br best bit of advice watch this then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgement
