dont drink the water is an unbelievably bad film its based on a 1966 broadway play by woody allen it stars jackie gleason the comic genius behind the honeymooners the director howard morris has appeared in several mel brooks comedies life stinks high anxiety silent movieand has made a mark in animation characters he has voiced include gopher from pooh jughead archieand beetle bailey what went wrongbr br i think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively allens original play was tongueincheek which is why it worked on broadway and in allens 1994 remake the screenplay by rs allen and harvey bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play making gleasons wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesnt workbr br the acting isnt much better gleason does the best he can with the material but he cant save this gleason was a comic genius  but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in the hustler and soldier in the rain his abrasive personality could have worked here but the lousy script doesnt even give him a chance too bad estelle parsons airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes see how soon itll take for you to want to strangle her that is also a shame because she is also a fine actress having turned in two exceptional performances in bonnie and clyde and rachel rachel none of the other actors do particularly well eitherbr br woody allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and julie kavner marge simpson in the leads they manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece its finally on video after a long battle over rights do go out and find that version all the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcomebr br 12 out of 4 stars
