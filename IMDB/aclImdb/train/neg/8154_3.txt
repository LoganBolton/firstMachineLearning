the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
