i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles eg good will hunting the fisher king the world according to garp these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although wellacted is one of the worst movies ive ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to smoochy club paradise and alladin on icebr br every good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i dont need a feelgood hollywood cheesefest but ive got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness this movie reminds me of love liza which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares
