i just got the uk 4disc special edition of superman 1 for about 5 the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the molemen so i slapped it into the dvd player last night and here are my findingsbr br some initial disappointment  i hadnt checked and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials im not a huge fan of george reeves as superman and i hadnt seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn  but hey ho never mindbr br this black and white production runs for less than an hour it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves early tv series a twoparter put together for cinema release although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series in any event its an odd choice for reasons ill get to later im of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets so there were no major surprises here even so for a low budget movie this one is really low budgetbr br the story concerns the small town of silsby  population 1430  which puzzlingly is also home to the worlds deepest oil well 6 miles the story opens with the wells foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well at the behest of the oil company as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down a couple of odd little guys small in stature big in head black in jumpsuit and bushy in eyebrow emerge from the cappedoff drillshaft and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their facesbr br a deep breath now here is the remaining plot of the picture the little guys scare some kids so jeff corey playing the towns rampant xenophobe incites some pals to kill these creatures superman steps in moderately ineffectually and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital coreys pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed but he escapes and legs it down the shaft corey incites a lynch mob despite the sheriff arresting him to hang the hospitalised moleman superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows a total of 4 molemen emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey i call this an aargh gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go aargh and superman saves him he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved the molemen go back down the shaft the endbr br despite the film only being an hour long there is an inordinate amount of creeping around bewareing and pursuing  i have left out all the moleman 1 creeps from a to b looking out to make sure noone is following him stuff the molemen are never engaged in any way whatsoever  they have no dialogue  they just turn up get persecuted and go back they do look a little creepy but they are hardly the bugeyed monsters that the towns reaction impliesbr br reeves is quite a good clark kent  very much a hardnosed reporter much more so than phyllis coates rather indifferent lois lane but he is a terrible terrible superman not only does he not look the part at least his hair is dyed black in this which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes the way he plays it is all wrong in my book im sure he was told to strike the pose which superman does constantly but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips not fists on ribs and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher  he doesnt actually wag his finger in remonstration but he may as well have donebr br and superman does a huge amount of walking around i say a huge amount  he isnt actually in it all that much and a bit of running he takes off and lands a couple of times but isnt seen in flight at any point oh some bullets bounce off him and he uses telescopic vision as clark but with no accompanying visual effect in fact visual effects are conspicuous by their absence and the few which are present arent very goodbr br ive tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards i think its a pretty threadbare effort thankfully production standards on the tv series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to thembr br something of a disappointment  i shant be watching it again
