mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957br br well the movie mainly takes place in 1986 the movie falls into the 80s trap of weirdstupid special effects including some weird demented looking rocking horsebr br anyway mary lous spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one persons body whether or not she succeeds youll have to watch to find outbr br anyway the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters this also isnt really a sequel the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school it has the avg horror flick fall backs gore pointless nudity knocks against the catholic church basic stuff boring moviebr br the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 you can waste your time doing something else
