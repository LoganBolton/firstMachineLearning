i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life there are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk and the vocals are like a broadway version of danzig singing the darkness of the forest oh the darkness of the dark dark forest or something else so unthreatening the singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a trebley microphone over some synthedup string section and fake drum beats its horrible br br yes the male leads are awful so are the female ones this is one bad case of gender stereotyping  its so bad everything they say revolves around being a male or a female just playing up the stereotypes to the max makes me sick soooo boring br br the children were so echoey in their lines you couldnt understand them and why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair pretty blue dresses and long hair and ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair not scary  stupidbr br daddys face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave nice beard and bangs pa did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salonbr br stupid movie
