its a ghost story its a cannibalism story its a revenge story its a very poorly done film with a lot of violence i suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie youve ever seen it has the usual isolated place the cocky campers heading off to the wilderness granted there are some pretty intense scenes its just so dull bad editing and the whole works there are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket im not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by it also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually whats left of his wife a friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous sick violence i fear that its just another step in our desensitized evolution three is no cleverness here no tongue in cheek only a sad waste of time lots of blood little plot
