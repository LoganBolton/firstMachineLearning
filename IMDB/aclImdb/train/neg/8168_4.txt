a truly disturbed cannibalistic psychopath johngary kent under the pseudonym michael brody who lives in a cave stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness stevedean russelland his buddy charliejohn batisget into a playful argument with their wives sharontomi barrett the late reallife wife of gary kent teddiann wilkinsonover surviving in the woods camping by themselves to prove a point the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of los angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward falling prey to john teddi is soon killed as sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their trucks overheating afraid tired and paranoid sharon receives some very unusual assistancejohns ghost children thats right johns children remain in the wilderness ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods taking a special liking to sharon helping guide her to safety and her friends meanwhile steve and charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where john lives cooking over a burning fire the meat simmering is actually from charlies wife teddi unknowingly charlie eats from the meat when offered by john who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place anyway soon worried about their wives steve and charlie set out to find them as morning breaks meanwhile john goes a hunting with charlie steve and sharon in a fight for survival when steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario with sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safetythey even at one point plead with their father to not kill her charlie unfortunately doesnt have such friendsbr br director donald joneswho also wrote it and went broke funding the filmsmartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking gorgeous location in the sequoia national park in california where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights and i basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose for some strange reason i didnt particularly find jones direction of the setting very atmosphericthe dread was missing although there are some rather disturbing attacks by john using his knifeshot in a clever way jones camera suggests more than what is actually on screen yet somehow still achieves that gasp at what john is doing to victims within such a picturesque landscape to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac that kind of increases the terror city folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place to smell the clean fresh air enjoy the sights of a lovely view only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife providing the backstory to why john is the monster he is jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wifes adultery and reacting accordinglyshe is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children wishing to punish them for being naughtykilling both her and the lover in beda refrigerator repairman the children sad and depressed committed suicide and now haunt the wilderness still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose i realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some but i found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious they do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably the music i found hideously 80s and the performances arent mindblowing i mean i could react to the situation they were in because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well i think the film is similar in many ways to dont go into the woodsalone except that the forest has the aforementioned ghost childrentheir voices echo when talking to sharon their father or each other gary kent looks like a filthy george lucas with tattered clothes and humanity lost as i mentioned above the violence isnt as grisly as what is suggested because director jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettledsuch as teddis murder the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation her pleas for john to stop and once stabbed several times attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished offa hanging corpse john is skinning ive seen better and worse of this type of slasher film its rather mediocre at best with some effectively shot scenery i dont really think its particularly memorable for the exception of the ghost children
