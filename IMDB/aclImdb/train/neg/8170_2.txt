a friend and i went through a phase some alot of years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evenings entertainment for some reason i ended up buying this one probably v v cheapbr br the cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre theres also a few very amusing scenes among them is a scene where a mans being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects it made me laugh at the time doesnt seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you gobr br apart from that its total crap mind you but probably worth a watch if you like films like chopping mall yes ive seen that too
