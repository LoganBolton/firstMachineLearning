the title of this obscure and almost righteously forgotten 80s slasher inevitably reminds me of the cures megasmashmonster hit song with the same title hence a piece of the lyrics in the titlesection of this user comment also i didnt have anything else to say that was useful anyway but hey the forest isnt totally hopeless and not even that bad actually if nothing else at least it obeys the admittedly unwritten first rule of 80s slasher kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime sure youve heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before but dont let that discourage you from watching it as the forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image its actually a bit of an atypical 80s slasher the main characters arent ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism the concept isnt always successful let alone plausible but its more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of california but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands barely set up for the night they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children the children themselves and finally the father whos out hunting for human flesh the demented family may be real or imaginary but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive they have already vanished the men too encounter the family and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background the forest is a weird and unusual film to say the least its not exactly a masterpiece of plotting but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to openminded fans of 80s horror the murders are fairly gruesome and willfilmed including a slit throat and a painful sawmassacre and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful the more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists the less it makes any sense so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer the acting performances are just above average the music is okay and at least director donald jones also responsible for the 70s exploitationsickie schoolgirls in chains tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80s horror films too bad it ultimately fails
