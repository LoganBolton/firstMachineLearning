i watched this film last night with anticipation but really wasnt very impressedbr br with the exception of combo i thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited it came across like a made for tv dramabr br i felt that the film was very contrived the whole set up of hammering in the context at the start yes we get that this is 80s britain  you can stop now was tiresome and gave a very onesided view of what life was like in 80s britain  poverty war juxtaposed with royalty margaret thatcher yet nothing in between there were actually middleclasses who existed back then  just ordinary working people with a decent wage and a mortgage the falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end for dramatic effect i presumebr br the sequence of events felt a tad disjointed as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset couldve changed so quicklybr br the relationship between shaun and smell was toecurling i couldnt even look during the snogging scene i find it very hard to believe that she wouldve been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger but also looked so much younger i know there were only four years between them but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties yet its a huge difference in your teens in my experience that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one since girls mature so much quicker and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older sorry but i didnt buy it  an unnecessary plot point created for shock valuebr br the ending was somewhat abrupt and again contrived if the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic then it fell somewhat short in my eyesbr br it bugs me that british films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the povertystricken dont get me wrong i love trainspotting and four weddings has its charms but cant we brits come up with anything different why are our films always so hung up on the class system i was born in 1973 so wasnt much different in age to shaun wouldve been in 1983 i grew up in a single parent family on a fairly downtrodden council estate in a city in england however my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film  i dont even remember racism being an issue although im not saying it didnt exist this is england not in my experiencebr br the bottom line is that i felt this film lacked substance and i was completely bored and unimpressed throughout
