have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before that happened to me with the young graduates the cover of the video box if you can find the video is extremely deceiving id swear that the two women on the cover arent even in the filmbr br anyway i was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film orit is simply pointless junk im heavily leaning toward the latter but i guess some out there have developed a connection to this moviebr br hmmplot a plot lets seethere must be a plot around here somewhere nope i cant find it its pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago one of the female students has a crush on her teacher the teacher has a frigid wife whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg so he is receptive to the girls advancesbr br theres a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing our cat booboo was transfixed by the dancing high school kids she watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor its nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic 110
