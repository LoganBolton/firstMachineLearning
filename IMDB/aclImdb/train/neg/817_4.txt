youre not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place they havent done you any harm in the second place they may be radioactive ah the joys of nobudget 50s scifi yet despite the odd gem like that superman and the molemen is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58minute running time its beyond cheap the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation and pretty dull with it though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute molemen diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious merely misunderstood and george reeves man of steel tries to prevent the local smalltown mob led by jeff corey from killing them an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day perhaps but with little more than good intentions to recommend it
