this is almost like two filmsone literate and engaging the other stupid and clich√©d its really a shame all the problems werent worked out with the writing but considering how quickly most bmovies were written and produced this isnt too unusual its a real shame though as this could have been a very good filmbr br first the good the movie is original and involves wwii codebreakers this is pretty fascinating and i liked watching the leading man lee bowman go through his paces as a master codebreaker in fact the first twothirds of the film was very good but now for the bad the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes additionally jean rogers role as the kooky girlfriend must rank as one of the worstwritten and distracting roles in film history for every smart move made by bowman the idiot rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided comedy relief if her role had been intelligently written the overall film would have improved immensely instead watching her its hard to understand how we actually won wwii
