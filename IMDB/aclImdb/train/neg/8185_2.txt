oh my i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends wanting to watch one of those mild feelgood christmas movies and i walk out disgusted the movie failed fullstop paul giamatti who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine they try and turn a christmas movie into some newstyle sort of bad mixed with good but it all turned out very wrong the first ten or so minutes werent too bad but once we saw santa it was over it didnt get any better the rate stayed the same there was no character development and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented dont watch it whatever you do
