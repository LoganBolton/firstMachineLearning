did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldnt pull this one out about twothirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i cant believe i signed the contract its not the worst movie i ever saw but its on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesnt move with vaughns conman dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just cant get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into
