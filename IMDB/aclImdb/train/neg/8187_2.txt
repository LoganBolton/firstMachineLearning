i went into this movie expecting it to be really godawful and it was i really felt sorry for the starstudded cast kathy bates was a wonderful actress before she made this movie vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldnt put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for freds dad played by trevor peacock of vicar of dibley fame amongst others had about one linebr br the plot was predictable and all over the place and the humour was lacking however there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic dont see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a headon collision with a train actually maybe the train would be better
