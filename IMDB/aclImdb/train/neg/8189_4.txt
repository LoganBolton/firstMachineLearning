its always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family so imagine that your older brother is santa and then imagine how tough that must be thats the premise herebr br vince vaughn plays the titular fred an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people dont go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother santa played by paul giamatti too much praise for simply being the limelighthogging famehungry slightly creepy guy that fred would want to portray him as then wouldnt you know it fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to christmas and hilarity and life lessons ensuebr br well thats what should happen the reality is that we get a christmas movie featuring a few good moments of vaughns patented fasttalking a ridiculously outofnowhere music video moment kevin spacey playing an auditor out to close down santas operation and hes one of the weakest baddies i have seen in some time not enough of the gorgeous elizabeth banks in a lush christmas outfit too much of john michael higgins in his elf outfit to be fair hes a highlight though and a movie thats too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in its latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the timebr br rachel weisz is along for the ride too as is kathy bates but its really nothing more than a movie for vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here unfortunately theres very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker outside of vaughns rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problembr br david dobkins direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p christmas card that you send the auntie you havent seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious christmas pudding nope we get a burnt bland lump with too much sugar on top forget this and stick the hilarious elf on again if you want a great modern christmas comedybr br see this if you like the santa clause 2 santa baby the santa clause 3 the escape clause
