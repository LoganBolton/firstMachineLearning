my take a tired formula christmas comedy the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be toobr br i love the holidays as much as the next guy even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues but it seems its just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year but that doesnt make them any less painful during the season as if we already had enough santa clause movies three and gulp still counting who wants to see a movie about his brother in a plot that would be at home with disneys santa clause franchise save the occasionally crude humor and santas little helper wearing a short skirt fred claus is a onejoke premise that goes on for 116 minutes sure jolly ol saint nick has a brother but where does it go from there br br its a shame really fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow but it would have been so much better than this vince vaughn is your typical snob but we are led to believe hes really the long lost brother of the neveraging santa paul giamatti who invites his good ol brother to visit mrs claus miranda richardson is reluctant and worse an efficiency expert kevin spacey has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas and his this close to being shut down hah and guess who plays santas mother kathy bates of course elizabeth banks is santas helper charlene john michael higgins is one of the elves and rachel wiesz plays freds girlfriend si dont know if id praise the casting or to bash it here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality but theyre given way too little to work withbr br as for humor the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santas brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers where he is joined by stephen baldwin roger clinton and frank stallone but the giggles begin and end there worse still the movie even succumbs into sentimentality thats supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what christmas really means apparently what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they canbr br rating  out of 5
