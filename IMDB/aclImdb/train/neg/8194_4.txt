how hard is it to write a watchable film with vince vaughn paul giamatti and kevin spacey apparently very difficult for the writers herebr br i still have no idea how santa is younger and looks 20 years older than vince who plays the big brother i must have missed that part of the story but in reality it really didnt matter many scenes seemed out of place and contrived the kind of funny notion scenes that are drug out way too far to where any sense of comedy is lostbr br the directorproducer tried to go tear jerker at the end which would have been suitable if anything leading up that point had been worth followingbr br ugh major disappointment i can see how some people might enjoy this ok since many people will take any garbage theyre fed but i would strongly encourage waiting for dvd on this one not worth the 23978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days
