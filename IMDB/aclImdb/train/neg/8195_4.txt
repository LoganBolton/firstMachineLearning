every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of its a wonderful life i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa so sue me i admit it i like cheesy schmaltzy movies i like excellent intelligent ones too but as with so many things variety is a good thing what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic kaching kaching of santa in all his guises from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed fred is a perfectly ok holiday movie with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids my wife and i laughed a lot even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince paul giamatti was a topnotch santa which helped a lot not a great flick and unlikely to become mustviewing for anyones annual christmas traditions but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice theres nothing wrong with that
