this movie couldnt decide what it wanted to be there were a couple of subplots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end but they didnt if you want a alien in the frozen waste story stick with the 1950s version of the thing not the abomination that was remade in goreovision 20 years laterbr br i couldnt get over the fact that the alien looked pretty much recycled from independence day br br the bare minimum sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended moodbr br lots of scenery chewing with little payoff
