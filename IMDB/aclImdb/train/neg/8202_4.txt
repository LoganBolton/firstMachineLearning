is it a remake og the thing 19821951 i think it is there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny itbr br so the acting is bad james spader does a superlow stargate reenactment of himself with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinkingmovements but thats about it the other actors i didt even notise you dont get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters and the plot evolvement is slow boring and yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins scoremusic is ultraboring imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit but this is major crap some of the special effects are nice if it was made in early 90s if you like slimy aliens chills and thrills dont whatch this movie its a dull combination of the thing alien 3 outbreak and some jerry bruckheimermichael bay production gone really really bad now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing and the only ones on this production that knew that was no onebr br though i have seen far worse i would not recomend this movie to anyone but if you are up one cold night and just wanna glanse at something it will pass the time slowly
