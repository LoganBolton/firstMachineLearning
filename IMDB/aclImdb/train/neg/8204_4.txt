an unoriginal overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a scifi formula that weve all seen a hundred times before  a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something and in of all places surprise surprise antarcticabr br the film features james spader and an almost nameless supporting cast with the exception of carl lewis whos actually not that bad for a nonactor  who deliver hohum performances that do little to invigorate the scripts unimaginative dialogue to make things worse the films pace is slow theres almost no subplot and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd what is a wonder is why spader  an excellent actor at times who won the cannes best actor award for sex lies and videotape and did a splendid job in the innovative scifi flick stargate  chose to sign onto this lackluster project or maybe not if you look at his career for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hitsbr br the most remarkable thing about alien hunter is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great scifi films and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived there are huge borrowed bits from the thing both howard hawks original and john carpenters excellent 1982 remake contact and outbreak a few hints of alien ce3k the andromeda strain kubricks 2001 ie the alien black box and mission to mars ie the mystery message and even a little dash of sneakers and a remarkable mind although not scifi films they share a cryptology connection hell theres even cornfields and antarctica just like the recent x files movie and the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from the abyssbr br its all been done before and done a whole lot better although i will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end i could say a little bit more about the plot but theres absolutely no need you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it 5 out of 10
