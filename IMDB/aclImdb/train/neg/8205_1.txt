very bad acting and a very shallow story not even a decent bmoviebr br events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lamebr br this is one of the worst scifi ive ever seen i saw the 50 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre but it sucked so badbr br now theres really very few good movies on alien subject i think because most of them are low budgetbr br i give it 310
