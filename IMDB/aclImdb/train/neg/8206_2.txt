with one of my very favorite actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it wasnt after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows whats going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive ill add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if youve seen 5 scifi movies or you are over 9 years old do yourself a favor and skip this one
