this doesnt quite plumb the depths of creepshow 3 but it comes close it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology which is distracting to say the leastbr br it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone with the bookshop being comparable to serlings later night gallery unfortunately the producers  writers forgot that serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segmentbr br framing story adam west is well himself he doesnt go the bruce waynebatman campy 60s route but he rarely does he simply plays the notparticularlyenigmatic jay theres an ominous spinechilling name to compare to the likes of dr terror eramus and the cryptkeeper and makes some mildly awkwardcreepy statementsbr br abernathy seen rod serlings a stop in willoughby then youve seen this the red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose but even the main characters friend identifies him as a wimp as well directed as can be expected but basically incoherentbr br nexs diner reminiscent of various serling time travel stories mixed with steve allens a meeting of minds most of the actors arent too bad except for josh astin as cassius who manages to walk talk and even breathe awkwardly and the idea is mildly interesting but like abernathy it doesnt go anywhere the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions bugs out a bit who wouldnt and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wastelandbr br life replay not a bad little piece and manages to predate both click and creepshow 3 i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls the main character is mildly sympathetic nothing substantially innovative here but its okaybr br fighting spirit you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character it has some heart and its a decent story of defeat and redemptionbr br finale so why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits dont know and doesnt make sense so all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer thanks guys and the guy in the first segment died so how did he get trapped did he visit the bookstore before he died got trapped and didnt die what huh i supposer this isnt expected to make sense because its supernatural but stillbr br overall basically not dissimilar from the two newer twilight zone series or some episodes of tales from the darkside or monsters the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time but theres nothing really spectacular here
