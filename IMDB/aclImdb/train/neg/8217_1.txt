five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew they stop off at a store  accidentally hit another car  decide to just drive off  leave it soon after the other car forces them to stop  a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out  shouts at them makes them take their clothes off  makes them pee on them  then randomly drives off shaken  shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost  are low on gasbr br produced  directed by greg swinson  ryan theissen with swinson writing the thing  theissen responsible for the cinematography  editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst i mean im struggling to think of a film i have seen thats worse now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the filmmaking decision taken here were deliberate to try  provoke atmosphere tension realism  suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didnt hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube  even then its still slightly embarrassing  a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining  fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb the amount of 1 star comments is revealing  they cant all be wrong right  its message board which i think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks its absolutely trashed by just about everyone  the phrase the worst film i have ever seen is used a few times  to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things  i have to agree with them the story is terrible alright i suspect its meant to be minimalistic but this minimal theres never any reason or explanation for the events that happen  it just feels totally random it goes on for ages the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who dont seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff  screaming a lot oh god the screaming there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates  annoys  prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly then theres the real killer the entire film is set  shot within the confines of a mini van seriously the camera never leaves this car  as you can imagine it gets really boring add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen  five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passionbr br on a technical level again i can see that the filmmaking style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again  say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as its a visual medium  i definitely dont want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk it really does look that amateurish  that bad its a complete eyesore  i hated every moment of every second of it just think the blair witch project 1999 only ten times worse looking  sounding  you will be almost there there are times during five across the eyes when you literally cant tell whats going on or happening because of the camerawork  the almost pitch black  grainy contrast levels the violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood  a stabbing at the endbr br low budget doesnt even begin to describe five across the eyes with a supposed budget of about 4000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release the two vans in the film were owned by members of the production  thats basically pretty much the entire budget right there the locations the acting is pretty bad by the main cast i just hated all the fake put on crying  screaming that didnt convince at all but did irritate immenselybr br five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen  i have seen a few films whenever anyone now asks me whats the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention i hated it every single aspect  wretched moment of it
