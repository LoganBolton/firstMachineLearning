less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful all this horror movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes arguing crying and screaming do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldnt watch itbr br the movies plot had potential to be something great but it just doesnt happen a group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them two minutes into the movie and the characters are already arguing and this doesnt stop all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining crying screaming acting and arguing none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too so you dont get to really know these characters or enjoy thembr br the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers none of these women looked a day under 20 and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old at least get people who look the age none of them gave even remotely decent performances and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities the actress who played the killer overdone it but she at least showed something that the other girls didnt  a little bit of talentbr br the characters dont help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny stupid bitches that is all i can really say about them and it did not help that they all survived if i have to go into detail in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot one girl injures herself and is whining about itfour of them arent wearing seatbeltswhat do you expect one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killerand you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help whateverbr br the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible i dont care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out shook and brushed up against an actress was horrendous it was also grainy and at times you couldnt hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening tobr br supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life no wonder they didnt show the car getting hit this movie is so cheap they cant even show a car getting a little scratched up oh gotta mention the soundtrack alsoif thats what it was it was horridsad one second then hard rock the next br br at the end of the day five across the eyes just feels like a terrible homemovie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes it doesnt help when the script is terrible the scarestensionsuspense and hardly even any gore to make up for it are absent the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendousbr br this was a horrible lowbudget movie avoid it at all costsbr br 110
