definitely definitely the worst film ive ever seen no questions asked contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others since its an independent lowbudget film but cmon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifyingbr br agreeing with everything that has been said about this film for example the mind numbingly weak acting when its this bad you take another go at shooting the scene god damn it the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script assuming such a thing existed during the production there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains  five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her why dont youbr br the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it  which is as the rest of the film a good idea executed exponentially dreadfullybr br oh and by the way this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a handheld camera  this is an effect and not a trait used cleverly it can be breathtaking but in this case its an excuse for inadequate cinematography
