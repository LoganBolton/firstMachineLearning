watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green tomatoesbr br l only hope that this piece of trash didnt cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isnt a sequel in the pipeline
