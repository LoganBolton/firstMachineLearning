do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itbr br the acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls makebr br the majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblebr br i spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours dont do it
