given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing sobr br if you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my 92 yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a datebr br okay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the score is interesting since all  with the exception of one  tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenbr br the most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
