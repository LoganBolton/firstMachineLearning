 contains miner spoilers  br br i have seen a number of decent indie horror films such as the hamiltons the boys love mandy lane and cabin fever unfortunately i felt five across the eyes does not fall into this category from start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script god only knows why the writers thought dialogue such as no dont go out there dont go out there shell get you if she gets you shell kill you and if she kills you youre dead is of movie qualitybr br this film displays very little character development and to be honest i couldnt care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities all they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls arent crying their arguing when they do converse the topics are completely random about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated appropriate subjects when youre being chased by a psychotic killerbr br the soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heavenbr br the camerawork is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable im guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls car almost the entire movie i think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible to feel and experience what the girls are going through but due to a very shaky camera grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic its one thing to make a film subjective but its another to have action on the screen that an audience cant decipher because of the poor cinematographybr br i understand that five across the eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality there are no redeeming factors to this film bad acting poor scripting shoddy camerawork and no story in light off all this i decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying arguing aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations however how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car
