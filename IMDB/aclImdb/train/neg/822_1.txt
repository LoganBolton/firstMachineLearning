there are really two sections of this film firstly theres the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the the simpsons troy mcclure should be doing the narrationbr br then the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really doesnt fit in with the rest of the film which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sensebr br this is especially so with mickey rooneys spiventa who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the organisation the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he wouldve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still isbr br the overall problem of the film is that its totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy its as if the filmmakers didnt have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusionsbr br put simply the film fails on all levels
