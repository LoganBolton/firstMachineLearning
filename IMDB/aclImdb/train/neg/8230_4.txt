im dumbfounded yes thats right im really caught here no way did i find it awful but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency the idea behind such a trim minimal lowbudget indie production isnt bad but its a confused muddle and in the end didnt do anything for me its amateurish and simple it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that oflate fashionably rapid filming style we have the documentary laced handheld camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating keeping it still will help the context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads at a roadside store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight scared they flee and not too long that onelight suv appears behind them soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out noisy and relentless cat and mouse game br br as for being disturbing i guess that depends some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects but also i found myself snickering too in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush but hardly believable the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be watch how blood runs freely but its not entirely convincing and can get dull the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive we get screaming spewing bleeding running cursing body fluids and so on quite unpleasant details followed too with little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up too many cringemoments arose from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in it was about setpieces waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern br br the performances jennifer barnett angela brunda danielle lilley sandra paduch and mia yi are workmanlike with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the scripts weaknesses in its characterfoundation  veronica garcias flippedout bugeyed intensity as the loony driver of the suv was something yeah something her characters real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually nonexistent i guess being psychotic was good enough now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack terrible techno music to cheesy hardrock and an overwrought closing score it never felt overdone or got in the way but it did stick out like a sore thumb codirectors greg swinson and ryan thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasnt the case
