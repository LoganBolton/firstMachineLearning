may contain spoilersbut doubt it can actually be spoiltbr br five across the eyes can be summed up in one wordamateurish this film tries its best to be different from most films by the blair witch type of filmingit doesnt workit just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera a van and decided to make a movie the story has no explanation the protagonist is given no real motivation and looks like a lesbian wearing a powersuit compared to the five girls and there is no violence to speak ofjust the sounds of screaming and crunching the whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question the five girls really do their best with what theyve been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actressesalthough with the material given its hard to judge if they can actually actthey spend the whole movie screaming squealing and whimperingso much that half the time its hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad its actually hard to tell who said it this video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terrorthat literally sums up the whole moviewe then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive with one minus a finger the only thumbs upget itfingerlol is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voicesand their pride after making this terrible movie do not judge this by the posteryoull be very let down
