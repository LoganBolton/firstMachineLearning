as horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crapshoot sometimes we find a real gem but many times we find that the film weve just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box such is the case with five across the eyes  a title im sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out br br the story or at least what the ahem writers think passes for one centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fenderbender in a gas station parking lotbr br in fairness its an interesting idea some of the best horrors have very simple story lines its in the execution of five across the eyes that this idea falls flat the film tries to be a cross between the blair witch project with its shaky camera work and the texas chainsaw massacre in its barebones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither what we get instead are redundant scenes of chase torture release chase torture release in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching moaning and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding inbetween chase sequencesbr br the look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark which in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism here its merely annoying the characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hardpressed to find anything to sympathize with them one character stops to get a firstaid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like dont go out there shell get you if she gets you shell kill you and if she kills you youre deadbr br it was an accolade from fangoria magazine and dreadcentralcom listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out talk about a fake orgasm perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section im all for lowbudget indie horror but this one takes the crapcake give five across the eyes or fate get it a passbr br razorfriendly gives fate 1 slash out of five
