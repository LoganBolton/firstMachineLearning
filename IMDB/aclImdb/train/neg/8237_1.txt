how in the name of all thats holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someones mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie and thats all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more screamingbr br i gave up after fifteen minutes and fastwound through it to see if anything happened it doesnt  except for screaming of course odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem  there is no camerawork to speak of every shot looks like every other shot  middle distance one angle dull dull dullbr br its not so bad its good its just plain bad
