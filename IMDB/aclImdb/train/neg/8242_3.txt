after just watching five across the eyes i gotta be honesti just didnt like it i had read so many good reviews on this movie but i just didnt get where these reviews have came frombr br i have got a lot of time for newcomers into filmmaking and im sure the directors will do well for themselves but the budget they had was the main problem there was two cameras used in the entire film which was ok but they seemed like really cheap cameras another problem was the sound you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time all talking on top of each other  its just impossible to hear what theyre sayingbr br it had a good idea going for it in a nutshell they hit a parked car then drive off a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit driven by a mad woman who wants to kill them and has plenty of chances to do soand on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape but dont br br very frustratingi only just scraped through this one
