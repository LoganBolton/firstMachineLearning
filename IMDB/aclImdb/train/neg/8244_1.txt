i think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly its been made and simply is its oneandahalf hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girlsbr br sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since its a horrormovie and i usually like horrormovies ive no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever its no spectacle other than that its simply grotesque its so lame it even gets boring and really quick toobr br the worst thing if the above wasnt bad enough for ya about this movie is that theyve tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap handheldcameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough theres an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch in this film theres no other explanation than hey yall we wanted this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you cant make out what theyre saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better soundwise or other wisebr br than finally theres the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap eurohouse to the worst grungy hardrockbr br my advise dont watch this under any circumstances
