yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre  all the classic clich√©d scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare ones love the characters are onedimensional caricatures save for lovehewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses our goodnatured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending if youre looking for a bridget jones notting hill kind of experience you wont find it here
