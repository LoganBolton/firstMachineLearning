gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination its a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the jobbr br nobody tells him anything though hes given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information thats supposed to be suspenseful instead its annoying and boring br br hackman goes through with the mission but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you dont really carebr br one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit maybe something really was lost in the translation but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audiencebr br a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark candice bergen mickey rooney eli wallach and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here its a crime br br and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this the fbi the cia the dea or even the irs
