at least its not full of sensless violence or fluff its also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strangebr br directions to no conclusion i also dont believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging
