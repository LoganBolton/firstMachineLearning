the only word i can think of to describe this movie is ordinarybr br the plot line about gary sinises character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and cmonliving as some sort salingeristic hermit or recluse in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldnt handle life in the lucrative proam golf community cry me a river i wish these were my problems i do enjoy dylan baker and sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for sinise the scene in which little timmy price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it
