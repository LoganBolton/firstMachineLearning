i saw this movie way back when it premieredbr br it was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typedout messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their handsbr br then suddenly these children many of whom werent even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy left and rightbr br this whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder opened it to the child and said type the picture you see then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator a fold would fall down revealing another different picturebr br so while the child may have seen a dog the moderator saw something like a boatbr br every time every bloomin time the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed never what the child was shownbr br so who was doing the typing never the childbr br this movie further took a disastrous turn with as the australia poster stated the person who molested the child in the movie was in the situation trying to help the childbr br had melissa gilbert never put her son in that place he wouldnt have been molested is what the movie says he was better off under her supervisionbr br if i turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead do you think im going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that not likely i think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out that this movie was based on they never accused someone within their operation as took place herebr br unfortunately i do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from gilbert as the mother of an autistic but other than that the movie really didnt do muchbr br the worst by far was the child typing at the end to patty duke and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed      we won this child was molested if you cut my leg off and i take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me assault whatever then that is legal justice but it doesnt bring my leg backbr br at best in my condition i will view it as a hollow victorybr br whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestationbr br a normal child has enough to contend with from such an experiencebr br its utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go we won if that person is found guilty in courtbr br just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here
