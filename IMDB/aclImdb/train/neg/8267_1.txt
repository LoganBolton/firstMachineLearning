im beginning to see a pattern in the movies i give a 1 to they are almost all movies that my wife made me watch maybe i should stop having faith in her taste in movies anyway this is typical drivel aimed at preteen girls but done even more poorly than usual once again the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie heshe made the main character unlikable she starts off by being a complete btch to her friend at the beginning and then finds out when she becomes 30 that shes basically a shtty person having affairs etc why the f would we feel for this person ok lets say we can get past that jennifer garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity i dont know if its her or the writers fault but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance heres a tip for future filmmakers 13 year olds are not entertaining theyre annoying far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to thriller holy crap that was painful it showed her practicing that dance at the beginning that explains why she knows it but an entire club full of people argh the macarena would be more believable all of a sudden shes completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices at least tom hanks character on big had a job that made sense to a child these bodyswitchingchild becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand and this is by far the worst one yet
