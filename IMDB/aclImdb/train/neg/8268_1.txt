this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i cannot stand when writers dont come up with their own plotsbr br a girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult hmm sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called big what is even more annoying is jennifer garners acting she doesnt act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupidbr br from then on you can guess the whole plot she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her wow how awesome but noher friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job but of course she wins in the end when she comes up with a great ideabr br theres also a dancing scene in the movie that ive seen a thousand times beforebr br i hate this movie
