this esteemed production has its fans but to paraphrase the classic bad review of mary reilly moby dick is like a painting only slowerbr br this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie production are never to make a great film rather its to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea in this case for a books transference to film with a list of hopelessly atomized undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking theyve seen greatness as viewers  critics are apt to fall for this oscars follow feeding the whole dumb equationbr br i dont share in the pleasure all these reviewers found moby dick is stunningly uninvolving actors dutifully recite essays about jonah moby dick the ocean moby dick moby dick all things that cant respond and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest its dramatically inert it doesnt build in narrative terms moby dick as a movie is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story after half an hour i was muttering oh terrific another oath another 4 minute soliloquybr br in the failed effort to involve you its a pretty campy overacting showcase a lot of grey hair here starbuck is supposed to be a golden god br br one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone elses paintings  palette or reverently embalming a classic as huston does here paintings and books are nice but theyre a different mediums a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap village of the damned is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture this is the eat your vegetables school of filmmakingbr br one appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie but not the narrative only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work  various sea efforts and the technology of whaling and that doesnt call for a twoplus hour movie
