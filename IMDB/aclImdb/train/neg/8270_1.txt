non existent plot tons of poorly directed  supercheesy scenes snipers  world famous sharpshooters who cant even hit their targets a few feet away plus whats up with the ending a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnivals shooting gallery wth technical mistakes how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock 100 these people fire their guns without the need of reloading the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn aliens terminator cant save this junkbr br do not watch this movie i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one hopefully the director would either stop making movies or learn more for his next movie
