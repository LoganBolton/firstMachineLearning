at the end of dragon heat all i could think of was why i bothered sitting through the whole thingbr br the films premise is interesting and that  as well as maggie q  is what attracted me to the film in the first place but was i ever disappointed writerdirector daniel lee cant hold a candle to the likes of john woo ringo lam and corey yuenbr br this has to be one of the most annoyinglydirected films i have ever seen lee is so wrapped up in his visual style  and i use that phrase incredibly loosely  that he fills the film with completely needless blackandwhite stills freeze frames slowmotion fastmotion and other visual nonsense i suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialoguebr br the action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hoppedup music video more than anything else there is little to care about any of the characters  including two supposedly professional snipers who couldnt hit the broad side of a barn from the inside  who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue i have seen in one of these hong kong actionersbr br the plot is devoid of any twists and turns  from the initial setup everything unfolds in predictable fashion  and lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters back stories in case we didnt get it the first several times this is awfully amateurish writing and filmmaking and wastes the talents of sammo hung michael biehn and maggie q though to be frank i am hardpressed to remember biehn being in any good film that was not directed by james cameronbr br if you really are in the mood for a great hong kong actioner you are much better off sticking to some of the staples  john woos the killer 1989 and hardboiled 1992 ringo lams city on fire 1987  which quentin tarantino stole for reservoir dogs 1992  or his point blank 1967 remake full contact 1992 or even check out yuens so close 2002 a supremely entertaining yet preposterous popcorn flick and theres always the terrific french police actioner the nest 2002br br true most if not all are a bit overthetop but they were films that remain exciting thrilling and even suspenseful they have characters we care about and mindblowing action sequencesbr br dragon heat on the other hand is just terribly mediocre the trouble is that lee has not made a bad action film he has made a dull one
