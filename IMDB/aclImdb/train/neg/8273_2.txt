a lot of promise and nothing more an allstar cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story thats okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon dynastys releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a blight they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs but they cant bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like theyre each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael biehn is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away
