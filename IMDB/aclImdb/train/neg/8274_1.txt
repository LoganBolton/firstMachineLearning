ahh this film had so much potential a good cast of quality b actors the thighs of jessica simpson and that is about itbr br i believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea basically lets do a kind of legally blond film but do it in new york that big bright city of chances power and money and where everyone is a heartless powermoney hungry person lets add to this jessica simpson small town bimbo that brother of owen wilson and for some no apparent reason andy dick only because of him you should ignore this filmbr br basic story linebr br boy leaves girl for ny girl follows boy cheats girl stays in ny with cousin gets a job under false pretenses mucks up is courted by other boy brother wilson and together save the day and kissbr br a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film ie dire awful unbearable intolerable and xenophobicbr br just dont watch this film you will be happier one reviewer referred to guantanamo and i definitely agree with him this film induces shock and i know what you are thinking at least at some point will i see simpson naked or close too its not gonna happen spare yourself the time and youtube her you will have better sexy timebr br the films editing is flimsy the acting is unbearable and why do they use blue screensbr br in conclusion this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximumbr br another question why does willie nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every jessica simpson flick and why are there no black latin asian or european people in this movie
