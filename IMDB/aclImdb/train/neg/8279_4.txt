this movie had all the elements to be a smart sparkling comedy but for some reason it took the dumbass route perhaps it didnt really know who its audience was but its hardly a mans movie given the cast and plot yet is too slapstick and dumbblonde to appeal fully to womenbr br if you have seen legally blonde and its sequel then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel great actors such as luke wilson should expect better material jessica simpson could also have managed so much more rachael leigh cook and penelope anne miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusingbr br many things in this movie were paintbynumbers the various uberclich√© montages the last minute misunderstanding even the kids party chaos this just suggests lazy scriptwritingbr br it should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you dont take it seriously but its such a glaring coulddobetter than youll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past
