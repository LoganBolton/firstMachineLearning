watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements dhl aquawhite strips rockstar and more its one product placement after another its quite obvious how this movie got its funding jessica simpsons acting is laughable any dick shouldnt ever get work because he plays the same lame character the story is just a backdrop for this very long commercial i cant believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release the longer you watch this movie the more youre embarrassed for everyone involved the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook who gets almost no screen time as jessicas cousin im embarrassed i watched the whole thing i would recommend avoiding this one
