this is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke i personally dont care one way or another about jessica simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her just as a movie this is something that wouldnt even get a passing grade in film school the script is a mess the acting is atrocious and the fact luke wilson cowriter of bottle rocket did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking he did old school for crying out loud this doesnt even belong in the same state as my old school dvd please for whatever reason do not watch this i see there is a comment that this is so bad its good but that frankly is too kind when will we stop seeing singers that obviously cant act keep trying to i hope ends soon the worst part is that there are actually some decent actors penelope ann miller rachel leigh cook  luke wilson who are part of this dump as far as the plot well it is almost nonexistent and so poorly done and written yes i know its another rehash i very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this please whatever you do dont waste your time but if you do feel sorry for the actual actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb jessica simpson youre pretty but stick to singing although im not much a fan of that either and whoever did this film i wouldnt put this on your resume 110 because you cant give a zero
