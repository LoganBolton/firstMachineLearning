who wrote this some guy named john cohen i guess this was the first screenplay hes ever worked on someone shouldve told him youre supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might saybr br and who directed this scott marshal son of gerry marshall my the nut has fallen far from the tree someone might have wanted to let him know that you can in fact shoot a scene in a cab in new york and it will look real and you wont have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from jessica simpson but hopefully hes learned that lesson nowbr br and jessica simpson naturally she cant act hell she makes jessica alba look like audry hepburn and yet shes starring in this movie oh wait it was produced by her father okay thats why she got the part thats really the only reason i can think ofbr br so should i be surprised its bad no should i be amazed at how bad it is i think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as i did i mean you expect a movie starring jessica simpson to be bad but this its not just bad its the complete opposite of a classic film think of a great woody allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good its the antiannie hallbr br i am so glad i didnt pay to see it i stopped watching ten minutes in cus i couldnt go on no doubt i wouldve walked out of the theater sooner in fact i wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing the film starts out laughably bad and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of chinese water torture and then around when the first act is ending you realize itll only get worse and thats when you either need to leave or kill yourselfbr br in conclusion this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at guantanamo bay although some prefer the water boarding
