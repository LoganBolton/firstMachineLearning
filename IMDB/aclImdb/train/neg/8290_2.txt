alan rudolph is a soso director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife rudolph squandered it the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms you get the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right thats the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of secondsbr br the shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention br br campbell didnt deliver he plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voiceover narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alterego played by denis leary
