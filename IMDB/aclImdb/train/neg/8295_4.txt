i tend to like characterdriven films i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work so i had high hopes for this movie those hopes were soon dashedbr br the main flaw with this movie is the direction there are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences the movie makes frequent use of the denis leary character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character it doesnt work for me at all this would have worked better as a play than a moviebr br there are problems with the plot as well it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started i didnt feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the moviebr br finally the editing wasnt well done either there was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boringbr br except for acting which i felt was consistently strong this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema
