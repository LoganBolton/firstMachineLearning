i heard about this film and knew it wasnt real good but i started watching the film on my filmchanneland was interested this could be a really great darkly black satire on todays morals in media the small featurettes on every contestent were good it build up to something i wouldnt wanna miss but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible cheap and rather silly heres where the writer should have added something that would make people think but instead its wrapped up and assuming people are this dumbbr br the ending is so bad i give it a 1 even if the film starts of promising
