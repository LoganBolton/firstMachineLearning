really bad why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved a christmas story the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writers memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level charles grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters for another it does not seem to have the same pacing  it just doesnt flow well everything seems tired and forced the joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here  you just want the movie to end i wouldnt even recommend this movie for curiosityseekers who enjoyed a christmas story its that bad 110
