since its release in 1983 a christmas story the jean shepherdnarrated story of his alterego ralphie has become a true classic my summer story however still has shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original filmbr br my summer story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops charles grodin who i normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original and his character never seems anything but forced kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps thats because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish nightbr br the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paperthin may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to a christmas story its a very poor one and not worth most peoples time 2 out of 10
