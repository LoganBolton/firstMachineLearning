apparently none of the previous reviewersmost of whom praise the film for its accuracy have actually read a biography of louis pasteurthe most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between pasteur and napoleon iiiback in the 1930s the latter was invariably shown in a bad lightwhile far from an admirable characterhe was an inept politician and a selfappointed military genius who allowed france to be dragged into a disastrous warhe was not the stupid reactionary depicted here he had an intelligent interest in scienceand like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bringfar from exiling pasteur he was his patronbuilding him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his researchwhile the lab was under construction pasteur became gravely illa bureaucrat deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead ordered work halted on his own authoritywhen the emperor heard about this his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buckpassing and work promptly resumedthe emperor personally visited pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his labthe emperor would often bring members of his court to admire pasteurs projectsand it was obvious to everyone that pasteur was one of the emperors favoritespasteurs main worry concerning the emperor was that napoleon thought pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experiencepasteur a very modest man was always protesting this but napoleon would say that he had complete faith in himand pasteur despite his misgivings always came throughthey always had a close and friendly relationshipand after the emperor was overthrown pasteur refused to say a bad word about himgrateful to the end of his lifebr br the part about his daughter having the baby and pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor never happenedthe part about the anthrax and rabies for which he was famous is generally correct but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is falsehe was famous and respected at the time this happenedthis movie is ok from a dramatic standpointbut very distorted as biography
