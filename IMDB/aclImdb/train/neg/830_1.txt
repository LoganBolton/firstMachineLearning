i really dont understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie ive ever seen and im not trying to be pessimisticbr br eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i dont think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the makeup everythingbr br the star im giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executedbr br dont watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch
