what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is and most us wars recently made only to get some oilbr br how many innocent civilian casualties there has been how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators arebr br so let me ask you  if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its ok but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well it is not your logic fails gentlemanbr br ill give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else 3 in total
