the thumb idea isnt such a winner the second time round thumbtanic wasnt as good as thumb wars for a number of reasons primarily i think mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic sendup unlike star wars the movie titanic hasnt yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audiencebr br in thumbtanic the holes are filled by oneoff jokes which dont really seem related to anything for example the heros insinuation that the heroine isnt clean during the jump off end of ship scene  its not funny rather you just think to yourself did i miss something in the original movie there were too many of these type of baseless jokes cf arachnidbr br by contrast the sendup of the smarmy ships designer had meaning and was funny also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningful humour to thumbtanicbr br the thumb media the faces and the voices are still amusing the props and sets and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation overall although thumbtanic proves that quirkiness alone wont work this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end
