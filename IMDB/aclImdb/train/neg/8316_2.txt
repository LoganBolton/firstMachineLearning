cedric kahns films have been characterbased rather than actionbased im thinking of lennui and feux rouges so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to succo i dont find stefano cassetti to be an interesting actor he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies like bret favre that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succos personality rather than admiring his skill at carjackingbr br the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in le besco apart there is little to recommend this film
