for a film about a killer this is surprisingly dullbr br nothing much happens and even when things do happen they dont generate any real excitement or interestbr br the acting is good from the two leads cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need tobr br the problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isnt interesting succo is not a unique character he isnt interesting or excitingbr br films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it
