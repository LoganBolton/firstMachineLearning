quite unimpressive the twists are all pretty predictable if youve seen any movies within the last ten years and the few somewhat interesting parts wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision are few and lack much punch since the secret has already been shown before these clues are explainedbr br spoilers sortabr br the acting is decent enough the story simply isnt very interesting the whole still awake premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuffnot kidding br br the surgery scene is initially tense a bit discomforting but then becomes utterly banalbr br not horrible but not memorable terrence howards least interesting role to date so far as ive seen br br kind of boring overall
