i was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when i checked it on imdb after seeing it this really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movies it looks like a good movie in the beginning but when he comes into surgery i couldnt believe how bad it got this voiceover destroys everything just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says i saw the movie in german so i dont really know what he said in english but ironic stuff like yeah right it doesnt hurtwhat is this telling yourself think about something else and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is juststupid and his motherhow the hell does she figure something like that out someone comes to tell her her son died in surgery what she kind of had to expect plus she found some letters in jessica albas bag plus that she knows the hospital stuff and then it takes her one second to figure it out what the hell and the endingwhy does the police bust them the patient died in surgery thats all that happened that drunk doctor doesnt know anything else eitherand then they bust them all even the girlfriend why despite all that i think christensen did a bad job but that doesnt really count for methose mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem i watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed as i said one of the worst movies i have ever seen just dont watch it
