i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violencebr br three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didnt sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 timesbr br there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute boys brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its partsbr br the 1st part boxerstalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lotlocker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want br br the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacksoff tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby  not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the allimportant transition from im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because id like to spread his ass and do him sm style a very important thing to leave outbr br clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent showbr br there wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
