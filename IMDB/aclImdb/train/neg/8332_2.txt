shiner directed by christian calson centers around three couples and their relationships with obsession and violence pretty good start as far as im concerned interesting the couples break down into a heterosexual couple two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being harmlessly stalked by a gay manbr br the het couple really dont have much of a role in the film there are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized my assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sexviolence are integrated in a couples life the couple arent very aggressive and its not even shot in any kind of erotic way as characters they dont add much to the theme or plotbr br the two male friends make up the bulk of the plot they engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley this escalates into violence and the violence changes them it becomes a means of sexual gratification and their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses the main problem i had is the violence is not convincing never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger it just doesnt work given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters relationships with violence this is a major problem unfortunately the makeup doesnt help either sometimes its okay other times it is very bad in one scene i really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face confusingbr br the more interesting pair of the characters is the stalker couple here calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these twobr br i appreciate that calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film it is admirable most low budget flicks dont aspire to much i dont think calson achieved want he was aiming for myself i found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling shiner was unconvincing this doesnt mean however that the director cant achieve something with his next filmbr br he seems to have something to say
