the pakage implies that warren beatty and goldie hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery but thats not what i got out of it i didnt get anything in the first half theres a new character without introduction in every other scene the first halfhour is completely incomprehensible the rest is just one long annoying underlit chase scene theres always an irritating sound in the background whether its a loud watch ticking a blaring siren a train whistling or even the horrible score by quincy jones there are a lot of parts that are laughably bad too like the bad guys chasing beatty on thin ice with a car or the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times i really hated this movie
