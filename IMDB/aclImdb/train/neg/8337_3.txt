millie is a sap she marries a rich guy named maitland and they have a child she then catches him cheating on her and divorces himbut lets him keep the kid she claims to love back then in the early 1930s she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easywith no supportwhat a sap later when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good he turns out to also be a cheat wow does she have a hard time picking menbr br as a result of these bad relationships millie changes now shes a wild party girldoing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck suddenly many years pass millies daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions havent changed one bit an old friend of millies yes its another evil man is now pretending to be the daughters friend but he has lecherous designs on her millie promises him that if he touches the girl shell kill him take a wild guess what happens next br br overall the film is a confusing and often bizarre messa bit like madam x but much much less focused so often millies motivations and actions seem to make little sense and the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into itso long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs unusual but not particularly good
