this film just goes around in circles and the viewer does not know where they are at first i thoughtmmmmm could be kinda cool movie this but it just drags on and on and eventually you dont know whats going on the lead female is a good actress and played her role well and the psycho fella is creepy but after a bit you dont really care what happens because this film just drags on shame really this could have turned out a lot betterbr br would say though that the lead female and psycho fella will have a good career ahead of them  but will they remember this film for making them known or for being the film they regret they ever made
