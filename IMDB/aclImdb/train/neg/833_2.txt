there really wasnt much of a story in this film it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness but there isnt much more than thatbr br it mixes some scenes from the original then it ablibs about how this movie changed them a little bit but still is that it i was hoping for something a little more instead all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanationbr br i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe then this is it but other than that it does little justice for the animators disney really should stop these directtovideo productions it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham d
