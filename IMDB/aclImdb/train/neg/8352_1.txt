i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if youre expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middleaged man the child is also lusted after by other leering men its sickeningbr br peter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple its revoltingbr br i dont see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles
