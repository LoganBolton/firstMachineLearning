any movie in which brooke shields outacts a fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror shields actually is only bad because shes youthful inexperienced and clearly not well directed by her costar peter fonda is bad because well because hes bad i liked him in ulees gold years later but lord above hes awful here not that anyone else is good theres not a single performance outside henry fondas delightful cameo that is even passable ive never seen a movie with this many bad performances in the case of luke askew the chief villain its clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction as hes done good work in the past but his partner played by ted markland is an embarrassing ham the writing is just bloody awful and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say but they say them so badly the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized this picture was far worse than id imagined and would have been utterly forgotten and probably never even made without the participation of a couple of famous names one bright spot the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite capturing the beauty of that area in a way even bigscreen imax productions have not quite done so well and finally either this is a bad version of paper moon with a lovable pair of fatherdaughter types or its a bad version of pretty baby with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a fortysomething and a 13yearold it suggests more of the latter than the former and thus is pretty disturbing
