this isnt one of arbuckles or keatons better films thats for sure fattys wife is tired of all his heavy drinking so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist keaton claims to have a guaranteed cure well once there arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery then he escapes and is chased about the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape finally despite staff chasing them about they escape at which point it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and arbuckle is soon recaptured however he awakens and everything after the surgery has all been a dreamthere was no sexy crazy girl and dr keaton isnt as big an incompetent as he seemed in the dreambr br a lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film sure making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low but in its day it was guaranteed laughs id laugh too if there was just something funny to respond to a lot of energy and thats allbr br fyiduring one of the chase sequences fatty wonders into a race for men over 200 pounds wow what are the odds of that and shortly after this he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted as a result the five is now on the back of fattys shirt and he looks like a regular participant however the number should have appeared backwards on fattys shirt but came out frontwaysa mistake as they should have realized the mirror image would have been a backwards 5
