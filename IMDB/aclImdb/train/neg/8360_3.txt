whats to like about this moviebr br it is in colour br br it has some impressive underwater photography br br it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times br br so 3 out of 10 br br sometimes the music is speeded up especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in br br sometimes it is slowed as if to convey to the audience its about to be time for sympathy br br as another one bites the dust as if in a spagetti western this has much similarity to br br its not that the italians cant produce quality productions there was a series of tv movies with a heading like octopus numbered about 1 to 7 screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafiatype conflicts and they were excellent but alas you wont find it herebr br i assumed it was made about 1960s sadly it was 20 years out of date as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end br br then there was the razorsharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters br br amidst it all either in barroom brawl or in observing the latest seaside bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyones character development br br at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly for his exwife br br but of course even if the music fails to awaken our realisation we have the sinister sound in the baddies voices as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge br br and near the end someone thought of a twist just when we thought it was all totally predictable but stay tuned folks for you may find another twist if you are watching closely to more or less warm your heart br br follow the advice of the hero and have a few beers along the way itll make your viewing of night of the sharks more enjoyable br br then youll be ready for something like a 007 movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over
