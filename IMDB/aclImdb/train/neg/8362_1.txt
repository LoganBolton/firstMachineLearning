this is one really bad movie ive racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make the acting is atrocious ive seen more believable performances on cable access the plot is ridiculous stolen diamonds secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst night of the sharks isnt even so bad its good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before its filmed and to top it off night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack ive ever heard im surprised my ears didnt start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to recordbr br from everything ive read the italian film industry was dead by 1987 night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin
