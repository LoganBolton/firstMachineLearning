i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because i think the wild women of wongo is worse this is an exercise in patience its like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist theres no plot theres no logic there is certainly no acting although the shark has some quality dialogue we dont wonder about anything we dont know how people got where they got its always amazing to me how things like this even get released i agree with the previous writer that it isnt even funny bad i know its about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a dvd collection its like a paperweight or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists sale it covers the crack in the wall
