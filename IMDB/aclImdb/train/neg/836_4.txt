a dedicated fan to the tlk movies with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced along comes this film now im not arguing with animation voice work music but this is no more than a timonpumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere although it isnt bad it doesnt add anything basically this movie is one big joke and thats about all that saves it make a real tlk3 disney the potential is therebr br 410
