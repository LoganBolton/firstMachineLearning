america a land of freedom of hope and of dreams this is the nation that since its independence has striven to bring democracy prosperity and peace to the entire world for the good of all mankind there are times however when one cannot help but wish that the americans would just stay on their side of the atlantic br br this movie and i use that word with some reservations evokes these feelings with an intense purity this vision of hell follows the adventures of calvin a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of marlon wayan onto the body of a two foothigh dwarf after inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of vanessa a careerwoman who is reluctant to have children calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her so as any normal man would calvin dresses himself up as a 2 yearold and parks himself upon the poor womans doorstep where he is discovered by darryl the broody husband of vanessa br br darryl incongruously falls for calvins disguise despite the fact that the baby has a full set of teeth stubble a tattoo a knifescar and the sexdrive of a 16yearold even more absurdly vanessa doesnt see past calvins babywear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert this wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts and fails to find humour in rape scatology sexual assault and paedophilia however in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of familyentertainment the wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality br br the brothers dim attempt a freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he had a bad father repeatedly hitting darryl in the crotch enables calvin to develop the loving fatherson relationship that both he and darryl have always wished for as if this wasnt ridiculous enough calvins attempts to sexually assault vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound littlewoman who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband br br in this movie the wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clich√©d sentimentality that has infected much of hollywoods recent body of work additionally they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming africanamerican humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that overindulges in fartjokes and crude sexual gags by rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again br br unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of american cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals
