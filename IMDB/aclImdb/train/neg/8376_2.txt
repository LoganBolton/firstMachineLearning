little man now on dvd is a wayans brothers flop its the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans who hides a diamond in a ladys purse after a heist he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the ladys home he then goes through all sorts of home alone or childs play like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film the jokes have been done in other places so many times that they arent cute or funny i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didnt use cgi and used the small actor who marlons face was pasted over in watching the deleted scenes minus cgi this actor was funny in a minime like way but they chose a different route a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenesspend your rental fee  on borat if you want some real laughs these daysbr br httpmcmusicnotesblogspotcom
