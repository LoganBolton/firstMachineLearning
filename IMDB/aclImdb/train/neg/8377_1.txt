this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless    because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can botherbr br this film is even worse than white chicks little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby story is awful considering it was written by six people the idea still wouldnt be too bad though if it was original and not a ripoff of a cartoon episode it has funny moments but some of them are way overdone and some are just stupid the acting was very very bad so was the directing anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves it is racist and very offensive to midgets i mean instead of showing sympathy to them the filmmakers make fun of them it really disgusts me how they do it they see midgets being just like babies and for a character who is a midget pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family that is its lame excuse for showing something like that it just was not worth it dont watch this film it is a huge waste of time and money
