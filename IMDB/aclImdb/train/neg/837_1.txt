i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and its a story standing alone you dont have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies toobr br but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king 1 12 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for id really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasnt funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and im very disappointed about itbr br if you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman thats really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has
