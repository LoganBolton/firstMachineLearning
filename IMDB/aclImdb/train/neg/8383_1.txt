ever this is the bottom i am not joking the theater shouldve had a warning of some kind abandon all hope ye who enter here wouldve been fittingbr br i dont have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutesbr br i remember when the wayanss were funny i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate im sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kickintheballs jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoonbr br i disliked nearly everything about this movie i wont spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayanss face poorly superimposed over the midgets body what i did like was the ending not the movies resolution but the actual end where we all stood up and walked outbr br i gave this movie one star but it clearly deserves less i dont feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets itbr br when are people going to learn if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film avoid it at all costs you have been warned
