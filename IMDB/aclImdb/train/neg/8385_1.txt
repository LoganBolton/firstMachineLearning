ive now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back thsi film isnt just poor its dire it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever madebr br i regret watching this filmbr br flixmedia reckons its a race issue apparently white people dont like it because it doesnt have white actors mate i think youll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivelbr br please stop making crap films
