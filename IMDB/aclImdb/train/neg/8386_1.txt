ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel its too easy so im going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of little man first im impressed with the special effects it really did look like marlon wayans head was attached to the body of a little person i never doubted it for a minutebr br secondly i loved some of the unexpected cameos david alan grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his renditions of havin my baby and movin on up were priceless john witherspoon who coincidentally played griers father in 1992s boomerang if you remember he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket now plays vanessas father in little man so that was funbr br beyond that this movie is about as believable as white chicks how dumb is it when even the doctor cant tell that its a 40yearold man and not a baby hes got a full set of teeth how is it possible that no one seems to notice that its not a baby little man is so bad that theres a rob schneider cameo and please if youre stupid enough to waste 8 on this movie at least do me a favor and do not bring your children this movie is way too sexual for small children lots of jokes and innuendo about sex going down eating out etc and i felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening i was forced to endure if you insist on seeing an idiotic film as least spare your children the pain and suffering
