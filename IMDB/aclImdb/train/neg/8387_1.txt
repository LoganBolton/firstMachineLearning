this was the worst movie ive ever seen in theaters it was just a compilation of recycled material people getting hit in the head is not funny people getting kicked is not funny after the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore it just got tired fastbr br i went with my younger sister she actually laughs out loud at king of the hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her im not surprised the story is pretty lame a midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in hollywood history then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby i know it sounds exciting but thats the whole story say those two lines over and over for 15 hours and youll get the picture there were predictable jokes galore i really felt ripped off after seeing this i wasnt expecting much and i was still disappointed i wish keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes andor his next script this was even worse than white chicks if that is possible ive seen high school plays that were better and cheaperbr br there wasnt anything positive about this movie i dont like my entertainment to be dumbed down
