a director and his crew head out to the isolated beal mansion to make a lowbudget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the beal family that have occurred there in the last century even with warnings by the caretaker the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house one of the crew find a book titled tibetan book of the dead and use some of the passages from it for their script but in doing so when red they raise a ghoul from its gravebr br boring confusing and tacky all rolled up into one equals this penniless midnight horror production what feels like an eternity it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas even though director paul harrisons clunky tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie moody and atmospheric setpieces but laziness did set it early the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest nor is it fun think of bob clarks children shouldnt play with dead things 1972 and now weve got older actors in the part however i found seven corpses to be inferior the script early on has some cutting wit abound before it ends up being drab predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities the cheap foundation involving limited sets didnt help matters either but the mansions dreary dark appearance had a creepy air to it performances from a recognizable bcast is mainly rigid john carradine in small part mainly lurks about john ireland plays a hotheaded director faith domergues washedup actress demands attention and charles macaulay hams it up the slow grinding premise is crossed between ten little indians and your usual zombie setup however its not all that engaging even with its occult and supernatural edge hell they even throw in some graveyard action with no prevail when the rotting ghoul makes its appearanceÂ… finally but a bit late it does get a little better if very baffling just like the inspired opening the ending is deliciously downbeat to bad in between it constantly drags continuity in many scenes comes across nonexistent and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier but indeed poorly executed in the movie theyre making then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears the generic music score flounders on with its shuddery but frank gothic cues and the camerawork is blandly staged with a lack of imagination shoot and frame shoot and frame job done thats a wrap
