wellnow that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his house of 1000 corpses crapfest i can now rest in peace nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ha anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a lowrent horror flick in his former abode in hell house sorry i dont remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago some like arthritic lurch standin john carradine whose small role provides the films only worthwhile moments attribute it to the supernatural bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum the result comes across like satans school for girls catchy title madefortv production values intriguing plot crossed with children shouldnt play with dead things lowrent movie about lowrent movie makers who wake the dead trouble is its nowhere near as entertaining or fun the house of seven corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second
