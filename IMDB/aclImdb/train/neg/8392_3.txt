this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really really sucks i normally sanctify stuff like this early 70s grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky lowbudget atmosphere usually rock house of seven corpses appeared to dispose of even more trumps since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans including john carradine john ireland and faith domergue and the filming locations the titular house the graveyard are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror the film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences though sadly enough theyre the only ones that qualify as such the credits are a splendid montage complete with freakish coloreffects and eerie freezeframes illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation the last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments someone falls down the balcony screaming a lady drowns in her bathtub and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker mr price carradine only fortify this reputation in other words the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director eric hartman john ireland to shoot his satanic horror film project the filmwithinfilm structure is what mainly causes house of seven corpses to be so boring and uneventful a lot of moviematerial is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or  even worse  faith domergue and charles macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes the plot finally gets a little interesting only a little mind you when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard the asthmatic judging by the noises he produces zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses after a running time of approximately 60 minutes the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing im still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die for some reason i honestly regret confirming house of seven corpses is a pretty dreadful movie the locations and scenery are gloomy chilling but not nearly used to full effect and theres a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed numerous lowbudgeted 70s gems were stunningly gross so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the filmwithinfilm murders really dont count even the alwaysreliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and harrisons direction is completely uninspired not recommended unless you think the zero cool fourandahalf minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy
