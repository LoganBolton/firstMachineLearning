but ive seen better toobr br the story here is predictablea film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred three guesses what happens this isnt a total bombthe cast is fairly good with pros john ireland faith domergue and john carradine giving the best performances its reasonably wellmadefor a low budget film just dont expect any nudity swearing blood or gore the film has a very mild pg rating i was never totally boredits ok viewing on a quiet night i saw it on videoit was a horrible printvery dark and some scenes were impossible to see still i didnt hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised mebasically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard worth seeing but only if youre a horror film completest
