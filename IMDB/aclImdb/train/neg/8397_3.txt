after reading the previous comments im just glad that i wasnt the only person left confused especially by the last 20 minutes john carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him i anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behaviornaturally i assumed he had something to do with the evil goingson at the house but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse hereafter referred to as zombie 1 these scenes made absolutely no sense please if someone out there knows why carradine kept climbing down into graves  let the rest of us in on it br br all the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so ill attempt a synopsis john carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate and is throttled by zombie 1 so far so good but then we get the confusing scene where john ireland and jerry strickler out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard discover carradines dead body strickler repeatedly tries to push ireland into the open grave from whence zombie 1 had emerged but ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead and presto strickler comes out as zombie 2 yeah i guess we can infer that strickler was dead allalong a witch but why he changed from normal appearance into rottingflesh version by flying into zombie 1s grave is never explained considering how excruciatingly slowmoving these zombies are id of thought he would have preferred to stay in his normal form until his business was concluded this scene also brings a question to mind  just who the heck is zombie 1  we can only assume zombie 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movies opening credits but who knows which one nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crewbr br anyway after ireland sees this transformation and runs away we see the exact same shot of zombie 2 shambling through the trees as we saw for zombie 1 this leads to momentary confusion over just how many zombies there really are then in best 1950s horrormovie fashion ireland manages to trip while fleeing he conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of faith domergues dead cat wasnt that nice of john carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knewbr br meanwhile zombie 1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house he easily dispatches three filmcrew members then starts up the stairs faith domergue hears him and thinking its lover john ireland back from his nightshoot goes out upon seeing its only zombie 1 she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves irelands revolver while starlet carole wells is showering at this point and cant hear the scream her costar charles macauley whos boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom does taking his sweet time and only after some more swigs from his hipflask he finally decides to investigate one thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how slow to react the stars are to screams and gunshots domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready but mistakes macauley for zombie 1 and shoots him six times he does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing then a horrified domergue backs up right into the waiting arms of zombie 1br br carole wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and domergues screams she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate so during this time zombie 1 has time to string domergue up from the neck with a rope wells sees domergues hanging corpse and faints deadaway the next time we see her is in a stream outside the house   but more on that later meantime ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers zombie 1s bloody carnage though ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people hes more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined mercifully for him and the audience zombie 1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor thats the last we see of zombie 1 at this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths showing that the new ones mirror the old ones how profoundbr br zombie 2 meanwhile has gotten near the house remember these zombies move as slow as molasses in january where he happens to see carole wells floating by in a stream and fishes her out how did she get there did zombie 1 carry her down throw her in then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush john ireland apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub so wells has to drown too but why outside in a stream instead of in the tub is never explained zombie 2 never makes it into the house himself everyones dead by now anyways thanks to zombie 1 but instead he carries carol wells back to the graveyard as the end credits flash on screen we see zombie 2 with his dead love still in his arms descending into the open gravebr br the viewer is left wondering yes but wasnt this zombie 1s grave why is zombie 2 taking up residence and what if zombie 1 comes along and wants to climb back in  is zombie 2 gonna let him or will there be a zombie fight will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased carole wells and what about nowdead john carradine  wheres he gonna stay after all from the earlier scenes we know hes clearly at home in the grave if this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused dont worry cause youre not alone
