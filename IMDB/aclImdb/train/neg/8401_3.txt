having just seen this on tmc its fresh in my mind its obvious that while the stooges are featured stars they dont really run the show first theyre broken into 2 groups  moe as shorty and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants so theres not a whole lot of full team work the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability theres another group of musical stooges that are unfunny unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish the music is tiresome they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses the dorky western wear is silly and theres an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera by the way this is obviously after curleys first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role i loved everything these guys ever did including all the noncurley stuff but this little dogie is pretty lousy
