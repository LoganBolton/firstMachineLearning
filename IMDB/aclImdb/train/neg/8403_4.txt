i gave this a four purely out of its historical context it was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on showtime in the early ninetiesbr br moe is the straight man and larry and curly act as a duo spade cooley has a couple of numbers i guess it had something to do with working on a ranch im not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory i vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy even the stooges seem to be going through the motions overall theres nothing much really to recommend herebr br if youre not a stooge fan then dont bother if you are a stooge fan then stick with the shorts
