before seeing this movie i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book instead its the book interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different illnesses that didnt bother me much but it hindered my enjoyment of the film one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable in my opinion if youre going to base a movie on a psychology text youve got to find a more interesting and preferably accurate text than this one the film drags during parts where its little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it werent sexual in nature because sex  interesting for most of us even me luckily there are several stories with actual character development that pull us inbr br but disappointingly krafftebings theories of sexuality went unchallenged for the most part i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this daybr br so in the end what do you have a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few sexual deviants before they are cured for most of the film the film moves with the crawling speed and mood of a wake and as an obviously low budget film the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier although i was pleased with the music costume and interior designbr br i felt this films subject was right up my alley and i still feel its a below average film it deserves a 310 a 410 if i were feeling extremely generous i cant imagine anyone enjoying this if they didnt already have an interest in sexual fetishism
