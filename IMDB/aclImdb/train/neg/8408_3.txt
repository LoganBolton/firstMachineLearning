wow this is very unusual in one regard usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch people are surprised when a sequel is actually better with tarzan i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch or at least the first six which comprise my tarzan collection dvd package i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey thanks to several charactersbr br well lets start with the good news firstbr br the good  plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display even if they are just stock footage you see lion attacks crocodiles hippos panthers you name it and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie since this movie was made almost 75 years ago i cant knock any of the realism because they didnt have it in the movies that long ago they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds however weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape he and osullivan make a wellbuilt handsome couple if there ever was one in those golden years of cinemabr br the film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english languagebr br the bad  from the moment jane parker is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen osullivan in hysterics shrieking and screaming scene after scene its enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film thankfully she calmed down in the sequels but not in this movie the movie also does no favors for the great white hunter image as c aubrey smith playing janes father and neil hamilton as harry holt the safari guide shoot at every animal within sight whether the beasts is threatening or not these people are kill happy particularly smith on another note its too bad there isnt anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up hes just there when jane and the group get to a certain point in africa
