i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someonethe picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there isis just plain stupid i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would dont waste your time on this movie or youll regret it
