this movie is all flash and no soul the actors put a lot of passion into the numbers but these numbers often didnt connect with the film and felt like standalone music videos and no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you every single one sounds like its coming from a studio essentially sucking all the life from the songs off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized especially hudson who essentially plays the same angry strong shes stubborn and selfish black woman weve seen before there was absolutely no depth to her character nor any of the other female leads though i think the movie wants us to believe that hudsons character faces hardship because of her weight it is really her own refusal to do whats best for the team that lands her in trouble making the end of the film totally meaningless hudsons academy award is a joke there was no justification when she sang she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced but this was the writerdirectors fault but when she was just acting she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character eddie murphys character is the only one with an arc and he did a fine job but still not oscar worthy the only actor who really brought something to the roll was danny glover who took a small relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it there is nothing here to sink your teeth into no drama or heart or even laughs the placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one the number when hudson is arguing with the other girls is so longwinded if it had been any longer it could pass for a family guy skit the movie has no idea what its about and i felt insulted by the last few minutes its a big boring waste of time and really is the worst film i saw in 06 and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with
