i just saw dreamgirls yesterday and i was really underimpressed despite all the oscar buzz this is nothing special anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics except for eddie murphys great musical and dramatic performance dreamgirls is just a glorified tv movie with no style or flair just a bunch of amateurs singing at each otherbr br now the first half hour was good but i was irritated at how eddie murphys terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film and the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum the remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting it was also visually dull and included too many soundalike tunesbr br condon didnt try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as id expected they would each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people singing at each other and the way they shot hudsons big love me number was criminal condon just shot her stomping around the stageno drama at all god it suckedbr br and note to all involvedthat singtalking dialog stuff might work on stage but it does not work in movies see embarrassing failures of evita and phantom all that ill teeeell youuuu something efffieeee crap should have been left on the editing room floor those arent songsbr br again the filmexcept for eddie murphys amazing performancewas nothing more than a glorified tv movie there must have been megabucks behind the pr work for this film i wonder how much money was spent to give it that prerelease one to beat oscar buzz as a whole this film was except for eddie nowhere near an oscar caliber movie except for eddie id rank it right up there with grease 2 big disappointment especially after all the very expenive hype
