i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a whilewhat with all its raving reviews nominations and media attention and i must say the first quarter of the movie was good it really portrayed the black music scene back then however as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits the singing just kept coming one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with rentbr br furthermore i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters i just didnt care what happened to them even when eddie murphys character died of a drug overdose i knew i should have been sad but i just couldnt feel any emotion for that character the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me inbr br finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development this movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances
