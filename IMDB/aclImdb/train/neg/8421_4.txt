funny that i find myself forced to review this movie but here i ambr br i am reviewing it because just recently i have had the chance to witness the revival of rc sheriffs play journeys end on stage in new york at the belasco theatre starring hugh darcy boyd gaines jefferson mays and others as well as being masterfully directed by david grindleybr br i left the theater shattered i am not exaggerating i was flabbergasted after almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldiers life in the trenches of the somme i speculate during world war one brought to life vividly by everyone involved i came out of the theater with the shakesbr br mind you i am not easily shocked nor am i too sensitive i am a stage actor and a director myself so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects both emotionally as well as psychologicallybr br but what i had just witnessed came so much to life that i had chills in my spine as i leftbr br none of these emotions came to life while watching aces high the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen in cooperation with rc sheriff himself shortly before he diedbr br the screen adaptation takes place in the skies over france so gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start withbr br the only plus of the movie are the aerial battle scenes which look dated in their special effects compared to todays standards but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screenbr br granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of all quiet on the western front by erich maria remarque which takes place in trenches and not in the sky but that was the german vision on things if one would like to be picky on such thingsbr br journeys end is just the other side of the medal and would have made it into a great movie if they had left it alone and intactbr br the transfer on dvd is poor even though in widescreen and adapted for 169 tv screens the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater nothing more nothing less it sports various defects such as minor scratches and dots although the copy for the rest is cleanbr br if you want another wwi movie in your collection especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among oldtimers then this is a picture for you but i rather would suggest von richthofen and brown as an alternative although that too is a movie filled with inaccuraciesbr br for the rest of you who love good acting and drama i would leave this one out buy the play go watch the play if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you but keep off this wouldbe adaptationbr br it is an antiwar movie granted but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime everbr br the presence of actors such as trevor howard ray milland richard johnson and john gielgud is just a bluff since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the moviebr br mcdowell the very talented christopher plummer simon ward and peter firth all deliver very weak performances not due to their lack of skills but rather due to lack of true and solid directionbr br there are too many gaps in it and as said before it drags itself to the dubious end dubious because in the original play none of the men we come to know and sympathize with stay alive they are all killed in a fatal and futile mission in the movie they all die except malcolm mcdowell who manages somehow to stay alive another day being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost causebr br the end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness you just hear the cannons roar the machine guns rattle and grenade impacts throughout the theater then suddenly total peace and silence the curtain comes up lights and here they all are lined up standing straight and rigid obedient corpsesbr br far more interesting and far more shocking than aces high finale which is also dragged by the hairbr br it is up to you to judgebr br for me if i had the money and the contacts to do so i would take the play and develop it the way it was meant adding here and there some action scene in the field just to visualize the outer horror and slaughter going on in the vasty fields of france around the men involved but then just strictly concentrating on what is going on in that tiny shack at the edge of sanity and the worldbr br want such a moviebr br then ask for itbr br this is not it
