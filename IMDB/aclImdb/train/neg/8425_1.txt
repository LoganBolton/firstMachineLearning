truly a disgusting vile film with only a small amount of real humourbr br the character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme intentionally so obviously and portrayed in the most pathetic seedy mannerbr br my wife and i found this film horribly upsetting with absolutely no redeeming features at all frankly i wish i had never seen itbr br i consider this british effort to be a sick and gross embarrassmentbr br those who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalorbr br the producers should be ashamed of themselves
