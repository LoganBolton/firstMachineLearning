this movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century  prewwii india where the british and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true indians are good surely such clichéd depictions of the british are rather passé nowbr br apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and twodimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginativebr br the story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment inbr br all in all rather uninspiring oh and linus roache just cannot do tragedy  going crosseyed with emotional pain just doesnt work for me
