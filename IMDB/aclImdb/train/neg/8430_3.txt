ok let me again admit that i havent seen any other merchant ivory the distributor films nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated with that admittance let me beginbr br before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesnt know which genre it wants to be at first it pretends to be a romance in most romances the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character is separated from the supporting character and is sometimes united with his or her partner this movies hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her his name is henry moores and her name is sajani and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj british imperial rule henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid despite his legal marriage and child overseas what could be better than that they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them word spreads to sajanis husband who questions her involvement with moores she denies any contact with him but moores asks her to leave the area sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film the film changes tone and becomes a crimedrama in its final portionsbr br sajanis body is discovered right as moores family comes to visit the alleged perpetrator is mooress englisheducated assistant tk tk knows of his masters affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened once he is declared innocent he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores tk is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fallbr br i want to warn you this isnt a romance film the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting this image is captured directly from the films opening but quickly disappears then its over it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love it isnt effective at all not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality they are bundles of walking clichés moores is an arrogant white man who doesnt recognize his indian friend tks intelligence tk is torn between his own heritage and his educative background sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life oh and of course moores family is inquisitive into sajanis death but still slightly racist to indians if the tone wasnt so serious i would be willing to overlook these problems but it isnt the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character developmentbr br no this film isnt terrible other than the laughable screenplay it isnt poor the actors are all experienced and perform well here nandita das who plays sajani was part of wonderful indian drama water even director sivan has an impressive resume he recently oversaw the terrorist which is part of roger eberts great movies collection what happened here why is this movie so bad well sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs apparently the story was timeless and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930s india i dont have any problem with that approach but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time the actors cinematography and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivans aura youll probably not enjoy it my recommendation is that you presume you arent in accordance with him and watch something else final consensus and ½ out of
