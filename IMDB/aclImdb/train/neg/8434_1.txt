this movie displayed more racial hatred of jews by david mamet than i havebr br have ever encountered in an american film the sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died i was so disappointed at joebr br mantegna calling a bunch of men sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons heros that common sense prevailed and i stopped i am deeplybr br disturbed at the concept that jews are not americans and different i suggest that mr mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same
