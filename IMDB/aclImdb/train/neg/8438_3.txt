i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all but just barely its sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd exposing people who may not be too familiar with lh to their worst stuff rather than their classic comediesbr br once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy whos invented an invisible ray hes in love with the bosses daughter who hates him and prefers some slick guy its incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what lh needed in their filmsbr br without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy insurance on stanbr br otherwise this script is just a mess forget this and see if you can find a copy of a chump at oxford or bohemian girl or sons of the desert instead
