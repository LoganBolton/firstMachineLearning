for those fans of laurel and hardy the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team their contracts with hal roach studios had expired and now they were free agentsable to work for any studio who offered them a job unfortunately fox rko mgm without roach and even a french film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents plus stan and ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad not particularly funny stan looked very ragged and ollies weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walkand so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very very sedate anticsbr br in addition to their age this particular film suffers because fox studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couplesomething that reduced their time on screen and turned them into insipid hangers on instead of just being themselves a cute and cuddly stan and ollie is very foreign to the old laurel and hardy of the 20s and 30sand just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorlybr br now even with their age this could have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio caredand its quite obvious they were using the b unit herewith at best second class support in particular there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadfulrelying exclusively on a sloppy rearprojected screen for the stupid chase scenewhich might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film historybr br for mindnumbed zombie lovers of laurel and hardy its probably a film they will love but for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films it simply comes up wanting indeed in fact of all their fulllength films pre1940 i cant think of one i liked less than dancing masters unfortunately of the post1940 films this might just be one of their better ones sadly it got a lot worsewith wretched films like the big noise and nothing but trouble i just wish the boys had just retired after saps at seabr br finally i wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on imdb might reflect the reviewers love of the team more than its an indication that this is a good film for an audience who are not already in love with the team i dont know how this film will do anything but bore the audienceit certainly wont convince anyone that laurel and hardy were comedic geniuses but even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents
