guernsey maria kraakman  belgiumnetherlands 2005br br the mousy maria kraakman plays anna a woman in her thirties who finds out her husband fedja van huet is cheating on her but she doesnt dare to confront him she painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings her parents as well as her sister so we have a main character in a feature film that doesnt do much at all we barely know anything about her background or her motivations just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley not just during this difficult episode of her life she obviously suffers from something but why do we in the audience have to suffer as wellbr br i almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess these were a very dull and painful 90 minutes normally i try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making ill take the beating and roll with the punches but in this case a fair warning is in place how on earth did nanouk leopold get funding in large part from publicly financed funds for this turkey obviously there was no script to speak off it could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal none whatsoever just a vaguely defined concept i want to do something from a womans point of view the result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on lifebr br to make things worse theres not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film i cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up but johanna ter steege is a small light in the dark if possible with this dire lack of material im trying to imagine how leopold tried directing maria kraakman maria look at the horizon well film you for three minutes just express sadness a perfect cure for insomnia get a copy and watch this late at night guaranteed too put you to sleepbr br camera obscura  110
