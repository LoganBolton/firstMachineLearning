definitely the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody tell me where should have i laughed theres not a single hint or shadow of an idea the three leading actors are pestilential especially the one i think its aldo from sicily who cant make a sicilian accent not to say about the dreamlike insertion about dracula just another expedient drawn from the worst cabaret tradition to make this film last a little longer massironi and littizzetto do what they can but this socalled movie was really too too hard to rescue i would have given it 010 but the lowest mark was 110 and so i had to overestimate it by one mark
