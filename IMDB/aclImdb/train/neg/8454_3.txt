this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here theres an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby carts weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the filmmaking itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointmentbr br that said theres a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
