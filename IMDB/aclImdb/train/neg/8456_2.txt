i began watching this movie with my girlfriend and after 5 minutes i was alonebr br i succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful experiencebr br i liked jean hugues anglade but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie br br there are only 5 characters and the rest could be called art or something that i couldnt express but that i didnt understand at allbr br the only worst movie i saw was crash but im pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully againbr br good luck o
