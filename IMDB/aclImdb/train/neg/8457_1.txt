i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat but this is no swat swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense bullfighter had none of these br br i should have realized that it couldnt possibly be any good after all the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring rolebr br one poster here called the movie incoherent another called it the worst movie ever both gave the movie far too much credit i am so glad i got it from the library for free yet i still feel ripped offbr br imdb needs to include a 0 in the rate this film vote just for movies like this one
