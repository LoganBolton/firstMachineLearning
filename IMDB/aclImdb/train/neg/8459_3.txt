some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a students graduate thesis in film schoolbr br there are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for hisher chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful  even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like youre at a picnic  but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw upbr br all right im being a little rough on a young director who might still go places  as i said the camera work is quite goodbr br but i feel cheated  the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well  but nobody actually connected to the films making seems to know that this is the kind of film theyre supposed to be makingbr br that betrayal is what hurts but even without it the fact remains that we dont like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just dont carebr br i took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldnt give me my money backbr br now that really hurts
