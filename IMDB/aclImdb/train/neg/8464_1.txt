i am very tolerant of really bad scifi and horror movies  ive been watching them since i was 4 or 5 so ive seen some really bad stuff but i deal with it ive even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much  a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of hope springs eternal i guess  or the triumph of hope over experience as they say unfortunately this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it but like a moth to the flame i kept thinking something anything interesting would happen it doesnt all of the actors give a decent performance  given the script i dont know how they all kept straight faces it has something to do with collagenstarved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race one body at a time theres an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humansdont worry he gets whats coming to him the slug people themselves dont really know where they came from they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth butsomehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them  the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that shes the worm queen and loves her for her selfoh must i go on please i implore you do not waste 2 hours of your life watching thisanything would be betterthink of the worst least enjoyable way you can spend two hoursit would be better than this
