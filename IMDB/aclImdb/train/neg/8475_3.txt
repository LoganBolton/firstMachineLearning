note i thought id be the only one writing what i did below but i see the others here agree i guess it was pretty obvious  this was overdoing the baitthecat bit anyway here is what i had writtenbr br the owners have left on vacation for two weeks  a trip to california  leaving the cat sylvester all alone and locked in the house that means no milk but the cat to his relief does find a bunch of canned tuna however to his dismay he cant find the openerbr br it turns out the little mouse in the house has itand baits the cat with it this is a mean rodent who keeps teasing sylvester with the opener and then yanking it away at the last second sylvester tries everything possible to open the can of tuna but cant do it br br this is a frustrating story and why they make the sadistic mouse the good guy is beyond me its like some of the tom  jerry cartoons where poor tom always gets the worst of it even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict
