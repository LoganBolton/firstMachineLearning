this movie was a horrible excuse fora movie first of all the casting could have been better katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom br br also the plot was pathedic it was extremely cliché and predictable the ending was very disappointing and cheesy but thats all ill say about that br br the nail in the bag though was a scene when katelyn jordan hinson was supposed to be crying but the girl couldnt cry on command there were no tears streaming down her face just a few unbelievable sobs she is not a dynamic actress at all she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire sp thats when the movie went from notsogood to just plain bad it really looked like she was acting br br in a nutshell this movie was really bad it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990s that everyones sick ofonly worsebr br i give it an f because it was just so darn hard to sit through btw i was babysitting when i saw it br br however you may like it if your 9 or under
