i personally hated this movie because it was predictable the characters were stereotypical and the whole idea was a rip off of the cutting edge and cadet kelly br br the main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she doesnt belong the whole place hates her and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesnt like her  well duh the whole damn school cant stand you amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her then comes the choice where she must choose between figure skating and hockey she chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationalsand gets to be on the olympic team no real surprise therebr br this whole movie was so damn predictable you knew what was going to happen before you even saw it this was so awful i nearly puked and by the time i was finished watching it i had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap dont watch this unless you are under ten or actually like crappy tween movies
