i cant say this is one of the best films i have ever seen but then again i cant say its one of the worst i have ever seenbr br ok so its basically a girl does skating is good at it wants to go to an expensive school cant afford it and has to take a hockey scholarship she has to hide her skating secret from her friendsbr br personally i didnt like the actress playing katelin she absolutely couldnt cry to save her life just made wailing sounds like a toddler pretending to cry to get its own waybr br katelin was just an annoying person the way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she draws the line made me cringebr br we all knew where it was going to go with her and spencer classically they didnt like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typicalbr br overall i think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you dont mind the main skater being extremely annoying its good to kill time basically
