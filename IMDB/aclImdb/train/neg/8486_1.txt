i cant believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie im a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy and i can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey see for example my glowing review of altered states 1980br br a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie the problem is not that the producers had a low budgetits that they didnt carebr br now to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the boxbr br chicago tribunebr br san francisco chroniclebr br san francisco bay guardianbr br actually i enjoy reading the latter two still their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor but i know if i ever make a movie with handheld camera a cheesy plot and stupid effects ill show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about conceiving ada
