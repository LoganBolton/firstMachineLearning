many days after seeing conceiving ada i am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious filmbr br no one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about ada lovelock her colleagues or the product of her endeavorsbr br likewise no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertainedbr br as a scifi film this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure somehow the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computerwith the advice and encouraging words of timothy leary i doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurdbr br as a drama film this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure somehow the writerdirector manages to fill eightyfive minutes with constant unnecessary annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing i doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distractionbr br i find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for conceiving ada the circumstances under which i saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that i would have otherwise i am still angry that i wasted the time that it took to see it only that i might more effectively criticize this movie i wish that i were more articulate
