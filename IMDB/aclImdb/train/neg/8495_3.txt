im the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on babbages difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc so if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film then i guess id probably be included in thatbr br maybe i just need to watch it again a previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired maybe that was my mistakebr br i tried my best to enjoy this film and there are aspects of it that i do like but overall i found it amateurish and quite ploddingbr br being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd i just cant help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made and how the employed graphics reflect that time ie 1997 having played games of the era cf mind grind to cite one example this film cannot escape that 16bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least in favour of actual game playbr br having to resort to watching this movie via a german fta satellite channel as i dont think its ever been aired on uk fta tv well not recently anyway i was mildly amused to see the end credits note gottdog god dog had 4 people working on its design maybe its mean spirited of me to be amused by this given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparisonbr br but as for the main story i agree that the format isnt the best idea like others i agree that ada deserves a film without the scifi angle and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable ladybr br there are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie first of all the underlying idea that somehow lost realworld information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents seems somehow ludicrousbr br also the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time eg the winds is now known not to be the casebr br ok so the victorians may have held this view but the 20th century works of g√∂del proving that no mathematical system can be complete turings works on the limits of computability not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics have all completely undermined these ideas which seem central to how the modern day researchers software is supposed to workbr br finally the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean programming is also just plain wrong as previously mentionedbr br this film maybe could have been ok but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakesbr br i wont forget the film though as like pi it is clearly a unique work but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it 310 from me
