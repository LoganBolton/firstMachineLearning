have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots no me neither well ive finally seen one in spring in my hometown and i must confess now i know why people dont do this the technique is arty to be sure but its definitely not ripe for public consumption the technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters and perhaps that might be the directors whole intentions i dont know i cant read minds and i certainly dont know enough about the director to make a judgementbr br but one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous antiamerican sentiments as an american im well aware of my countrys participation in the korean war and im very well aware that we werent always angels but ill be damn if ill take this guys version of how things happened according to this blind fool americans were not only at the root of the war we were the cause of the war and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country whatever mister director and i suppose youd still be making this film in communist korea if we hadnt interfered right talk about forgetting your history this is almost akin to making the nazis the good guys while turning the allied forces into the bad guys this movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that its almost embarrassing to watch for a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to american interference he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental
