one star thats all this documentary deserves i havent felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some timebr br im a big fan of the walking with series including its nigel marvin spinoffs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore having seen all the other docs from the series i figured i need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other placesbr br well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc what were you thinking lolbr br though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible it had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place horrible effects that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects and overused mtvstyle camera effectsbr br speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s maninsuit horror movie well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositionsbr br the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real it doesnt even look like it was taken seriously it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had remember the episode in walking with dinosaurs of the fate of the ornithochirus sp that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it its this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all when you are more engaged in the subject and its own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding itbr br the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the bbc version i saw and the music otherwise do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which i did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes this does not belong on the shelf with the other walking with docsbr br and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series hmmm
