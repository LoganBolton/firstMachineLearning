i seems in the beginning a interesting film a spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays madrid but it isnt none of that is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film it cant be worse in others words even the presence of a oscar winner  mira sorvino  isnt enough to justify the  300 dollars expended to see this film  the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home it lead to nowhere and is boring weak and bad dont expend time or money on this film
