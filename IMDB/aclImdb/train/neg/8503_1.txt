with all the european studios involved in this one you would think youd at least get some pretty photography but the local color is kept to a minimumbr br irritation 1 is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop  wtf the story is hopelessly confused theres a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused  is she or isnt she a lesbian  serving no purpose whatsoever the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time there seems to be some message about the mid30s spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead one doesnt see the point in itbr br despite the bullfighting backdrop of part of the narrative which part who can tell you never even get a good look at a bull fight earnest hemingway would have punched the director in the nose  with my blessings
