when we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs it was considered funny then but the producers directors and cast of semana santa angel of death in the dvd section of your local video rental are adults and they are still setting them offbr br like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenesbr br mira sorvino hot in mighty aphrodite and other toprated films seems to have undersold herself to this project her acting is nonexistent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the films various victimsbr br but let me warn youdo not be the next victim step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf tbere are not many good leg shots of mira the only high points i could find in the film and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badlydone dialogue with embarrassing spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production
