i was so disappointed by this show after hearing and reading all the hoopla about it how it was a ground breaking show and all sorts of wild promises if quality i tried to watch itbr br what a letdown the acting was way forced and exaggerated the story made very little sense as for any hint of the vaunted look into teenagers lives i could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality showbr br some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show the reason is that its really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is
