last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show youre not watchingbr br well theyre right that youre not watching it it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147br br translation this is the lowestrated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore its as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceledbr br the only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowestrated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure
