im amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe im not part of the same universe because if veronica mars is anything its over the top in a big waybr br the acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through thats not what i call realbr br it is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cutoff from reality rob thomas and his staff arebr br overall i found it to be at best a snoozefest and at worst more than a little annoying kristen bell looks like she could be a good actress but its hard to tell with the overthetop style of the whole show
