when i noticed that hamish macbeth was being broadcast in the united states i was thrilled i then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing i adore m c beatons books about the wonderful scottish constable the characters in the book are entertaining and very wellwritten the powers that be who are responsible for this mishmash apparently have never have read one of beatons books only the name hamish macbeth has anything to do with the series besides the lack of familiar characters i find the whole show offensively loud it seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other if you love m c beatons adorable hamish macbeth dont waste your time on this rubbish
