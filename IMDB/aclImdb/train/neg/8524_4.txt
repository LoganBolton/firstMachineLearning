it is a frank zappa axiom that music journalism is people who cant write interviewing people who cant talk for people who cant read if you ever needed proof that musicians cant talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow thank you idris muhammed this film is pretentious but while much of the pontificating from youssou ndour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates the music saves the daybr br the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave fort of gorée off the coast of senegal we are treated to gospel blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal theres also a good deal of ndours own compositionsbr br sadly thats another weakness its never entirely clear what ndour himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in selfpromotion on ndours part he wants to play his own music jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires hes clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gorée museumbr br the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir but ndour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in dakar at the end of the film to be fair they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil samba reggae then theres europe here the black diaspora doesnt seem to have produced any musicians of calibre since ndour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg are they in the team just because ndour has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnikblack powernation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka aka leroi jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance why do so many africanamericans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesnt have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and welcoming respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that ndour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakarbr br there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland bidding them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gorée slave fort the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely  more likely  to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exilebr br the two agendas clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which ndour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gorée slave fort the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory in the seaward doorway of the slave fort this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appearsbr br this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but dont expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour
