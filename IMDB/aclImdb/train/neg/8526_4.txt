i loved the curse of frankenstein so much that i rushed out to get frankenstein must be destroyed to see cushing at it againeven if it was without chistopher lee this time to my great disappointment this movie not only does without lee but it does without frankensteins monster altogether was it a case of if we cant get lee we wont have a monster at all why would they do that the monster is half the fun of the whole thing this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum i found the script extremely weak with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much im willing to suspend a fair amount but this movie got fairly ridiculous which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in itbr br peter cushing though is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well the supporting cast is competent but has little to do even the young doctor and his fianc√©e blackmailed into helping frankenstein a bumbling police chief is introduced along with his putupon sidekick to generate some comic relief then they are completely dropped from the movie why we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor and then it ends up being the victim of frankensteins brain transplant experiment there was no tension we werent invested in the creature and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequelbr br also there are virtually no horror elements yes there is a beheading in the beginning offcamera and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two mens skulls off again off camera and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene 90 of which is again offcamera i understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show but come on if youre not going to give us a monster then at least let us see the few horrific elements you do choose to include showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scarybr br on top of a weak script i thought the directing was mostly flat there were a couple of nice shots but otherwise no excitement atmosphere or suspense was generated the same director did curse back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directedguess he was as uninspired by this film as i wasbr br the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushings powerful nuanced performancebeyond that i found little in this movie worth recommending instead my suggestion is to watch the curse of frankenstein and see a truly great hammer horror film
