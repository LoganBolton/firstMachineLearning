even by 1942 standards of moviemaking the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme the machinations of one half of a pair of husbandwife exhusbandexwife to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another divorce or an eventual separation by means of jealousy humiliation or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story both of these movies features women with a strong indomitable screen presence and who played independent protofeminist characters in both movies both women were estrangeddivorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soontobe husbands and reigniting their passion for each otherbr br the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender here its norma shearer in the cary grant role out this time to ward off an exboyfriend george sanders by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo the problem is shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her midtolate twenties sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most  any man who would be in love with his fianc√©e on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene not here and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time not in speech inflections but in overall essencebr br but the worst part of it is shearer herself for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete overacting overemoting and overgesturing which while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of most of her roles why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs miniver on megahits now voyager and mrs miniver is a mystery but then again most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting that shed had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and its no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and cant wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible such could be the case here she seems lost she seems tired she seems ill at ease going through autopilot instead of living the part after this film she would make no more but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s
