this engaging which it shouldnt be lowgrade spanish exploitation quite tame i might add looks good but huh let me phrase that again huh actually the word huh would be going through your mind quite a lot nothing makes sense nor does it try too i just dont know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle but theres no denying how laconically uneventful strange and wordy it feelsbr br unrelated sequences tied like that nasty opening involving a little girl dead cat and fire in to a sparse story involving photographer mario played by a chestpuffing john caffari whos mustache is a dead ringer for nintendos iconic mario whats the odds that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady a gorgeously fixating patty shepard who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witchesbr br look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease raul artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages but for most part seems sporadically nonexistent and unfocused just like his writing ramon semperes striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on fernando garcia morcillos hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created the leads are capable but theres also a sturdy bunch the pick being v√≠ctor israel of secondary performancesbr br slow with little in the way of interest but this dreamy setup that seems to go on and on manages to keep you watching until its closing
