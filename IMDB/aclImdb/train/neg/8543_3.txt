i admit i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about 30 minutes  nothing was happening and everyone has already described the plot but has anyone mentioned the opening scene  a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and its impaled on the grass in the front yard im guessing the bratty kid did it put its never explained really trippy openingbr br i wish this had been a better written or thought out film because what were left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isnt a clever movie its just a poorly executed filmbr br i would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage i would like to see if it would help otherwise this is an odd little film that is best if fastforwarded through
