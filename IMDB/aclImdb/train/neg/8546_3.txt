highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain  for reasons again we are never privy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax  though it makes absolutely no sense at all  is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt make any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
