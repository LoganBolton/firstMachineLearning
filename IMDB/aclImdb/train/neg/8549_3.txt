okay what the hell kind of trash have i been watching now the witches mountain has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet at the same time its also strangely compelling theres absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with but somehow i couldnt turn it off the scratching your head with confusion starts right away with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mothers cat so you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces heck no because after this intro the girl and her wickedness simply arent mentioned anymore then cut to a guy with the most impressively trimmed mustache youll ever see who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way when she asks him to spend his vacation with her he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment great move the movie finally starts now as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks though not before he picks up a new girl patty shepard and photographs her topless throughout their journey all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained the girl wakes up in the middle of the forest loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep really car jacking witches apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers thats as close as i get describing the plot but theres a good chance im way off more important here is the atmosphere the witches mountain is occasionally very creepy with its spooky music and interesting cinematography the supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing patty shepard plays a good heroine this is the type of european horror film that could have been legendary if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay
