ladies and gentlemenplease dont get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tagthis is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever madehorror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror filmin shiningthere is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naivefoolish attempt made to create chilling horroreveryone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from realityall that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good tooa word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lostlazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to dothere is not much to be said of a baldcolored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actorno need to blame the bad weather for the tragedyit cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes
