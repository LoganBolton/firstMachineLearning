 just look at the poor robert webber character great performance once again who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic ironic and therefore timeless die hard the story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the sas commandos ideas like when a commando shouts heads down all good guys do it and all bad guys dont so that they can blast away ad lib with a good conscience that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously and it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun dont talk about the toiletmirrorsignal episode br br i dont mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled even headed representatives of power in this movie but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired this is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of judy davies she plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject anyway her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow i feel the movie let her down
