this is actually a pretty bad film the ideology is not as perverse as in those films collins made later however my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time the whole concept of an exsas man joining terrorists for no particular reason isnt very convincing and you cant help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists who later become pretty clueless fall for it the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale overall i think who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of the professionals but the story doesnt carry a feature film although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of collins career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldieroffortune or army films pity because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day martin shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career thats still successful
