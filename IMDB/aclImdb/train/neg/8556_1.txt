ok i kinda like the idea of this movie im in the age demographic and i kinda identify with some of the stories even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semirealistic and in a different movie would have been forgivablebr br im trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did but its not that easy when the filmmakers werent trying at allbr br the editing in this movie is terrible possibly the worst editing ive ever seen in a movie there are things that you dont have to go to film school to learn leaning good editing is not one of them but identifying a bad one isbr br also the shot oh my god the shots just awful i cant even go into the details but we sometimes just see random things popping up and that in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experiencebr br this movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also ive seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity joe greta i dont know what the heck you were thinking but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos you should be ashamed of yourselves in conclusion this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene if thats not your kind of thing avoid this at all cost
