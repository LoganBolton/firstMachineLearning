i admire kissing on the mouth for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation especially from the leaddirector joe swanberg they werent afraid to show trueness to everyday private occurrences unfortunately the film falls under the the brown bunny realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy yes it mirrors bunny with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely unfocused on absolutely nothing  feet hands or genitals again unfortunately i can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity other than that it was a complete waste of time we quickly learn of a postcollege malefemale roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her exboyfriend other than that we are subjected to the everyday events of their boring lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer for this all to work the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real neither work and its as boring as watching someone drive for an hour ie the brown bunny the only actor that stands out is kate winterich and even she does some questionable acting the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watchinglistening to again i admire the filmmakers especially swanberg for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or showerhabits but overall the film falls flat it has narrations that doesnt fit the scenes too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder other than the softporn factor why you rented this
