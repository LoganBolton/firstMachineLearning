the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlins character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that id like to believe that it is an insomniacured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleepbr br keep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
