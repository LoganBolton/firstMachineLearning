sorry someone has to say it this really iswas a dull movie worthy perhaps but dull nonetheless i nearly cried with boredom when watching it the acting is pretty dire the story drawn out and predictable the score and camerawork totally standard and unexciting its one of those movies you are not allowed to hate becase it is about disabled people but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective this was made to win awards  which i remember it duly did but it was neither interesting nor entertaining i havent seen the play so cannot compare
