you can be fooled by your first impressions as in initial reactions to a movie for example as in the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it first of all i love black comedies could even  despite being male myself  empathise with the feisty girls fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay was tripped up by my own facevalue and i do mean facevalue response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture it just goes to show you that youve gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that its bad and not bad good either the reason im giving this movie a 4 rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams the rest of er is pretty good too but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics  which means youll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through  and ill generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it i dont think its a total waste of time but
