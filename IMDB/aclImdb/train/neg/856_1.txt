these writings write about the end of the plot so dont read it if you havent seen this rubbishbr br i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror if i owned a video store id put it in the boring section this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socksbr br this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary well i drive to work and back and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats almost every day and trust me its not scary it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving even the little kid does it too round and round he goes and he never stops whats so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so toobr br the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason thats all that happens and as you can see its rubbish
