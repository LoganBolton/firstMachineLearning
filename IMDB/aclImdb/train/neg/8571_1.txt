penn takes the time to develop his characters and we almost care about them however there are some real problems with the story here we see no real motivation for the evil brothers behavior and the time line is screwed up supposedly set in 1963 the music is late 60searly 70s the references and dialogue is 70s80s the potential for a powerful climax presents itself and penn allows it to slip away but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch but not great
