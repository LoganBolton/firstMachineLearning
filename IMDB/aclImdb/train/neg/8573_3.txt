i dont like sean penns directing very much and this early work the indian runner is no exception the movie has no core its colored with a kind of redneck antiauthoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penns work his latest work even more so than the earlier frank miller robert rodriguez clint eastwood sean penn the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty but ending up being for the most part glorified pro wrestling matches and moralistic almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hells angels greetings and make me long for the days of deliverance which is a fine movie viggo mortensens acting is much much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg and thats about it the movie is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise a series of techniques more than a story kudos for charles bronson however who proves he can act and i wanted more of sandy dennis character a lousy 3 out of 10 for this the indian runner crap
