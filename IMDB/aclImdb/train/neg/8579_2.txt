im afraid this one is pretty dreadful despite several good performances and generally competent actingforthecamera direction its a first and last attempt by writerdirector soo lyu rub and tug 2002 is one of the unfortunate byproducts of canadas program to promote homegrown filmmaking while the program encourages worthwhile efforts like new waterford girl it opens the door for untalented novices like lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was greenlighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials br br you dont mind the low budget because the shabby production design bad lighting poor audio and dreary docustyle shot selection is consistent with the subject matter the workers in canadian massage parlors but the dialogue and the plotting doesnt give the actors anything to work with the editor much to assemble or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief when your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique even though nothing happens the movie is hard to follow and pointofview impossible to pin down br br don mckellars performance as conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in exotica lindy booths lea is her standard quirky airhead as always she is likable but here she is little else kira clavells cindy is a pleasant surprise a kind of asian shelley duval the only other role of any consequence tara spencernairns streetwise betty more than cancels out her excellent performance in new waterford girl her shallow performance in rub and tug should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared unless you need further confirmation of waterford director alan moyles skill in working with young actors br br you quickly conclude that lyus reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity so the need to insert a lazy and lame deus ex machina device toward the end is hardly a surprise still it could be worse the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case br br then again what do i know im only a child
