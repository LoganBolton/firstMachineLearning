many king fans hate this because it departed from the book but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump that notwithstanding the movie does fail completely but it fails entirely on film terms id like to smack the people who tell me its the scariest movie ever made i always follow up with the question really exactly what scene scared you every fan ive asked goes silent occasionally someone at a loss for a decent scare there are none names the grapejuiceshootingoutofelevators shtick if youre afraid of that i dont know what to tell you except maybe that youre easily scared i just rolled my eyes watching these zgrade horror ideas play out in this schlocky incoherent moviebr br one place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film br br oh and nice choice for mr hallorans artwork stanley black light afronymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie has there ever been a more off outofplace shot in any movie ever madebr br i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd and agree that kubricks 2001 is a truly important film given the immense bad will generated by both this stupid stupid movie and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fanboys who couldnt describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them br br toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson the introduction of dumb oneliners at tense moments and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie
