if my memory is correct when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy  a funny look at the adult entertainment industry if thats what its supposed to be it doesnt really work it just isnt that funny setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy failure aside since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter ill avoid comment about the authenticity of the story  which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto massage parlour except to say that  if this is true  the life is pretty dull br br for over an hour this movie really doesnt give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls arent giving full service  a euphemism for actual sex as for the girls themselves bettys goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is  well leah is a somewhat strange undefined character with a nipple fetish  true  who seems to be in the business because  well because shes in it i have no idea what her character was about those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this businessbr br the movie meanders about and doesnt offer much until the twist reveals conrad to be the bad guy we should have gotten to that point sooner the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story  conrads secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls that plan for revenge was pretty good and youre grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point youre wondering why you wasted your time with this had the story been more focused on the revenge this might have actually been a fairly funny moviebr br the performances from the 4 leads were all ok although i didnt think anyone came across as outstanding all four characters were a bit shallow cindy was a sympathetic character and so was conrad for a while although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie given the subject matter theres surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene in fact there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this as for the overall quality of the movie its a lowbudget effort which shows although you expect a certain griminess i suppose of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour so thats forgivable it certainly says something though that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writerdirector soo lyus resume and  given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry  that it wasnt even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards  the canadian version of the oscars 410  and im being a bit generous with that
