billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in sheffield this movie is a fakebr br as someone born in sheffield and still with links to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in oklahoma and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans  and many southern english people  dont realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary deadend semirural small town where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same oldfashioned pub and where the peoples idea of a party was linedancing in some villagehall lookalike this was a small closeknit community not a metropolitan citybr br the workingclass sheffield men were totally unlike their reallife counterparts who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks they dont chatter and they certainly dont sing in choirsbr br even the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd wales the peak district is in the summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars it is situated between two big cities it is not some kind of wildernessbr br as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete postlethwaite that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families they existed in a vacuumbr br anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middleclass writers and filmmakersbr br it was a gigantic fakebr br
