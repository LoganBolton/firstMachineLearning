americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial we tend to lose interest really fastbr br i found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule and guess what they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelingsbr br surprisingly when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film i found the characters to be interesting and highly engagingbr br i just dont usually watch that much late night tv so i cant recommend this film unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life
