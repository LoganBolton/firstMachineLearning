this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because its got george lucas behind it and it has the words star and wars in its title that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit this is a travestybr br first things first the story anakins evolution there is none apart from a little makeup around the eyes and a little yelling there is none he becomes young stupid cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence how good he was at almost everything he did planning fighting you name it the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockinessbr br what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith unacceptablebr br the fight scenes used too many digital doubles everyones flying all over the place like teddy bears in a makebelieve doll house count dooku emperor palpatine anakin obiwan almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping aroundbr br in one specific fight scene obiwan and anakin in the climactic battle they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart i realize the fights are choreographed but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgustbr br the writing was awful all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines but that just wasnt enough i cant say enough bad things about this film too much special effects plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe and absolutely no insights into any of the characters this is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered we know the rough picture of everything all lucas did was colour it inbr br we knew anakin lost his limbs we knew luke and leia are brother and sister we knew luke is anakins son we knew obiwan and yoda go to exile we knew everything nothing new is offered in this film if thats all the fans wanted then thats fine lucas couldnt have gone wrongbr br but when anakin finally becomes darth vader and he asks after padme and hears she is dead he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams nooooooooooooooooooooo that scene screamed bmovie all the way and i was half expecting darth vader to go danger will robinson danger at any time that is what this is a bmovie disguised by a huge budget and a ultraloyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth
