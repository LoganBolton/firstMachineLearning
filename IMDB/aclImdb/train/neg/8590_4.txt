ludicrous angelic 9yearold annakin turns into whiny brat 19yearold annakin who somehow seems appealing to amidala 5 years his senior now 22yearold jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams and so takes to slaughtering children his friends and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a his precious wife might really die and b only he can prevent this ludicrosity squaredbr br i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention the story is ridiculous the characters are unbelievable literally not the perverted sense of fantastic wonderful etcbr br obiwan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series but in the climax he hacks off annakins legs lets him burn in the lava and leaves him to suffer doesnt anyone think thats a little out of character not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living as it turns outbr br i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations none of that here the story could have been written by a 10 year oldbr br oh yeah the cgi is pretty cool
