to make a film straddling the prequels and the real star wars trilogy would tax even a great filmmakermr lucas is not that filmmakerbr br to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actormr christensen is not that actorbr br the first 6080 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star warsbr br count dooku christopher lee has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar binks silent br br no the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi and has one great overlong sequence at the lava falls
