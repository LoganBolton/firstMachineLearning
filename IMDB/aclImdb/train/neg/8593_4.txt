well i finally saw it i didnt go when it first came out because well frankly i was afraid afraid of how bad it might be or how disappointing while not as bad as menace and better than clones it wasnt particularly memorable or satisfyingbr br i was 11 years old when i saw star wars i still remember sitting in the theater from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience ill never forget a timeless story of the bored farmboy who just knows he was meant for more saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard the rogue pirate and the various comic reliefall in a spaceopera settingbr br and thats not to chastise lucas for using an old formula its an old formula precisely because it works and to his credit he gave it new twists that made it very specialbr br then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time the great villain vader was lukes father wow no one saw that coming of course im convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay go back and watch star wars again knowing what you know now particularly in light of the first three episodes see if it really meshesbr br which brings me to the problem i have revenge is an entertaining movietremendous effects plenty of action some good fighting scenes but a movie still lives or dies on its plotthe story it is telling oh certainly really good acting can save a weak plot but a weak plot coupled with bad actingthats a burden no director can overcome certainly not one as bad as im forced to realize george lucas is the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actorsliam neeson natalie portman samuel jacksonbr br spoilers ahead the plot oh my understand hes already handicapped by whats happened in the first two films so its an incredible burden one too much for him to overcomebr br first we have the sheer absurdities of the background we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine the product of a virginal miracle birththe chosen one well this detail never gets remotely explained indeed the closest explanation is yodas observation that maybe they were wrong oh well okay then our mistakebr br now this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c3po hey what a coincidence that is and hell come back to tatooine and never know he was from there wow how about that testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there eh george anyway we have this bratty kid moody petulant whining young adult who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic historythe great tragedy of darth vadorthe good guy who falls from grace only to finally achieve redemption in the endbr br how pray tell does this happen why he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth now sure he lives in a starspanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline but does it occur to the dark one to be to maybe check with a physician cause maybe just maybe this futuristic society might can do something about this problem why no the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil theyve been chasing for two films tells him that hes got the secret to immortalitybr br well of course he doesbr br sheeshbr br how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it how can anyone expect us to care hell why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil but because he was pathetically stupidbr br oh by the way amidala finally dies in childbirth why well they dont know the doctor who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced offers only the conclusion of shes lost the will to live well oh okay of course she has maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping withbr br but here we are we have kenobi present for all this he knows of the birth of luke and leia knows who their father is and knows what happens to them knows also the role of both r2 and c3po and yet in several years as luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3po and r2 curiously 3pos mind is wiped but not r2swhy stating i think these droids belong to you kenobi who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be the chosen one and apprentice to the emperor himself and who just happened to be built on this very planet says strange i dont recall owning any droidsbr br oh good griefbr br lucas simply made this up as he went along once he introduced vader as lukes father sadly the story began spinning out of control because he didnt know what the story was the plot of episodes 13 is simply incomprehensible nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star warsbr br its an afterthought and it looks itbr br i cant give this movie a high rating it reminds me of triple x a fun film to watch but entirely forgettable star wars will stand in my mind forever thankfully this one and the two preceding it will soon fade
