at one point violet lucy liu tells neil cillian murphy that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure she said because im borephobic it mean that she cant really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities well i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic because watching the detectives is a cheer boredom br br have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward but neils life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store shes an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him anyway after some dates they decide to see each other the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and cant really doing something normal whereas neil is completely opposite to hers the question is is they are going to be in love at the end you betbr br watching the detectives is a clich√© romanticcomedy to its core and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else from the first couple of setup we know that neil is pretty laidback guy who didnt really commit to anything and then violet enters the scene looking all weird and annoying so at this point we all know that were going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how theyre going to end up in the end is it worth waiting for i would say nobr br as i said they tried to give something more for the audience watching the detectives is trying to talk about commitment to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart or whatever well i think it is completely bullshit this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself forget about it that girl is one of a nutjob  after collaborating with many great directors recently danny boyles sunshine and 28 days later ken loachs the wind that shakes the barley and neil jordans breakfast on pluto to name a few its pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop paul soter by all means hes not bad as usual but such a talent actor like him shouldnt be wasting his time in the movie like this on the other hand lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet her acting is a mess i mean its all over the place and so overthetop tony montana would have been proudbr br the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title you simply cant really connect a dot between the plot and its title and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all in short watching the detectives is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldnt imaginebr br bloodymonday rating 154
