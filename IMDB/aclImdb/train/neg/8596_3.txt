basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns watching the detectives has none of thatbr br the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads not to mention the lack of any real visual storytelling style i mean this film is centered around movies yet is itself incredibly uncinematic thats a major failing right therebr br but the main problem is we simply dont care about the main characters because the script and the actors murphy and liu fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem well not terribly interestingbr br oh yeah another thing for a romantic comedy its not funny and the romance isnt terribly romantic eitherbr br so avoid it even at its 90something minute running time its just not worth sitting through
