i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released many reviewers out there arent old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multilayered supernatural story on the screen salems lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv miniseries directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubricks stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didnt happenbr br sure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments its all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here i dont care that many reviewers here think hes all that in this clinker the heres johnny bit notwithstandinghes just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter scatman crothers character dick halloran was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that ismany left kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters and often metaphysically kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately dont really care what happens to whombr br this movie still stinks and why so many think its a horror masterpiece is beyond me
