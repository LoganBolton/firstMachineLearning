ok where do we start with this little gem mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england  town only one man can stop them and that man is mike brady now if that wasnt laughable enough stay tunedbr br the footage of the slugs is whats known as stock footage no matter who the slugs attack or where they are the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown keep in mind this singular shot occupies at least half the moviebr br the acting in the movie was knock down drag out steal your wallet punch your girlfriend kill your dog bad im sure theres worse but youre going to be hard pressed to find it the only gem was you guessed it mike brady he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca because he was the best in the bunchbr br as for horror this film is not to be taken seriously there isnt horror theyre slugs for crying out loud the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two only watch this film in a mst3k type environment otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain
