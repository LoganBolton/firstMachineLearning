all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten then they start rolling the title credits you see slugs in big letters followed shortly thereafter by the movie whew i was worried i had accidentally tuned into slugs the musical or slugs the game show anyway from there the movie deteriorates into a killfest you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove two people get attacked by slugs while having sex and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs its a pretty silly movie falling in the sobaditsgood category it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that youre shocked to learn it was made in 1988 my guess was 1974 im very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here because most people here dont give those types of movie any love but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable this is one of your prime candidates
