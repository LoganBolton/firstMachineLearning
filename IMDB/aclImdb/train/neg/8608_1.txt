this movie features two of my favorite actors in kilmer and downey it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a toosmall part despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable michelle monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for downeys characters obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way its portrayed the ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do sobr br fans of the film say that those who disagree simply dont get it i dont think this is so the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding it was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured i got it i just didnt like it paddy breathnachs i went down and guy ritchies snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels are much better realized examples of the kind of filmmaking that director shane black fails to achievebr br i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credits mostly as a screenwritermakes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection
