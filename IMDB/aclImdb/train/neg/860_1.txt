kubrick meets king it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 i remember then the movie came out and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever sincebr br the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it the kubrick cultists dont give a damn about kings story they talk about steadicams tracking shots camera anglesthis is a film they insist it should be considered on its own as it happens both camps are correct unfortunatelybr br if one views it purely as an adaptation of kings novel the shining is indeed a failure a wasted opportunity a series of botched narrative gambits br br i used to blame that on kubricks screenwriter the writer diane johnson author of le marriage laffaire le divorce etc has a reputation as an novelist of social manners maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics but the little bluecollar town of sidewinder colorado doesnt exist on any map in her francophile universe br br kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial however he of course is the real auteur and considered on its own merits his screenplay for the shining  with its mishmash of abnormal psychology rationalism supernaturalism and implied reincarnation  just doesnt stand up to logical analysisbr br im willing to consider kubricks shining on its own terms im even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horrorgenre movie but it doesnt succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation alienation and madness either parsed either way the film pretty much falls apartbr br are the horrors of the overlook hotel real or do they exist only in the mind  first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance then as the hallucinations of his father one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror one notes how the hotels frozen topiaryhedge maze appears to symbolize jacks stunted convoluted psyche very deep stuffbr br but if indeed the overlooks ghosts are purely manifestations of jack torrances growing insanity then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchens deadbolted walk in closet so that he can go on his climactic axwielding rampagebr br and can anyone explain with a straight face that blackandwhite photograph helpfully labelled 1921 of nicholson as a tuxedoed partygoer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotelballroom wall during the films closing seconds are we to seriously conclude that jack torrances bad craziness stems from a some sort of past life experience and if you swallow that since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selvesbr br maybe kubrick didnt care about his storyline maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror whatever the case the film tries to hedge its narrative bets  to have it both ways rational and supernatural as a result the story is a mess this movie hasnt improved with age and it certainly doesnt improve with repeated viewingsbr br i dont deny that a few moments of fear claustrophobia and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long long film but those gushing elevators o blood seen repeatedly in little dannys visions are absurd and laughable and jack torrances infamous tag lines wendy im home and heeeeeeres johnny merely puncture the movies dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy i know i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief whew glad we dont have to take this stuff seriously finally kubrick is completely at sea  or else utterly cynical  during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son a foyer full of mummified guests all sitting there dead in their party hats yikes now i really am afraidbr br given jack nicholsons brilliance over the years one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeballrolling eyebrowwiggling scenerychomping performance that the director wanted the performance of shelley duvall as a sort of female version of don knotts in the ghost and mr chicken is best passed over in silencebr br this movie simply doesnt succeed  not as an adaptation not on its own terms it probably merits a 3 out of 10 but im giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely overrated in this forum
