when rodney dangerfield is on a roll hes hilarious in my 5 wives hes not on a roll the timing of the oneliners is off but theyre the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives dont add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if rodneys character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old mans fantasy than a key part of the comedy another old mans fantasy were supposed to accept that rodneys character is an athletic skierbr br jerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for workbr br the odd nods to political correctness later in the movie dont really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the nonpc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still dont get the point for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness the pc addins are just annoying digressionsbr br this has to be the mildest rrated movie ive ever seen there are some racy jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but thats about it maybe it was the topless men kiddingbr br the dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but i kept thinking they must be kidding theres also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latterday saints that somehow its not about them never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah and makes reference to brigham youngbr br in short my 5 wives was a disappointment i was hoping for rodney on a roll but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time
