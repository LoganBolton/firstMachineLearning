i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield indeed from me he gets no respect i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what i expected a stupid story without any real humour its full of lame crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developers dangerfield plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didnt capture my attention at allbr br in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner i didnt even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for thisbr br this truly is a dangerfield disasterbr br 210
