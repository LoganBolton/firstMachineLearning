this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes werent funny actors werent funny anything about it wasnt even remotely funny dont waste your time for this only positive things about this were the beautiful wives  and molly shannon who im sure tried her best but the script was just too awful thats why i rated it 2 instead of 1 but its definitely one of the worst films ive ever seen
