having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling  i simply couldnt believe it the movie is really awful in fact it is so awful that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced during this i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish socalled comedies from the 60s and 70s the pattern is as follows take one extremely popular comedian make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible add a bunch of jokes especially oneliners and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls  film that and you have a success i wouldnt know if this movie was a success but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly with a few great comedians it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us
