unbelievably awful film i watched part of this on tv recently my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mindnumbing drivel not a single line from the master of oneliners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfields body slap him around and scream how could you i know many films are done in haste hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme but please hollywood show a little respect for your audience its sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe the bottom of the cesspool even by sunday afternoon television standards
