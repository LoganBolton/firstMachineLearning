a disappointing filmbr br the story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didnt surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives its a pity though chrissy seem like interesting characterbr br story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahoris breaking ground with compelling cinematicallytold stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hoursbr br technically a disgusting shot film
