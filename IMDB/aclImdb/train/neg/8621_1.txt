the previous poster obviously worked on the movie its a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he didmentioning all of the actors names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that hes involved with it in some waybr br its on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars the one called ava is gorgeous and wellendowed were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reasonbr br also when i first saw it i was sure it was made in about 1986 and i was born in 73 so i thought i knew what i was talking aboutbut noit was made in 1993 unbelievablebr br though i would call it one of those so bad its good movies like watching a train wreck
