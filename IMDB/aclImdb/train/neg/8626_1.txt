looking through the other comments im amazed that there arent any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage first off i rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered indiana jones knockoff what i got was one of the most offensive movies i can remember trying to sit through made all the more shocking by the movies comparatively high production valuesbr br i dont think this is a spoiler but if it is be warnedbr br if your idea of entertainment is watching bimbo getting raped from behind by fearsome tribal chief while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant others severed head by all means rent this flick if not id advise you to look elsewhere for entertainmentbr br come to think of it that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that theres nothing else i really need to say about it
