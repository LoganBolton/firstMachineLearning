although this is generally a cheesy jungleadventure movie it does have some highlights  the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good you wont be bored watching itbr br keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghaid into escorting rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country he never takes things seriously  shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her  she doesnt really have to act much shes not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a ta picturebr br theres nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it produced to be shlock it succeeds without too much fuss a good 2 am cable programmer
