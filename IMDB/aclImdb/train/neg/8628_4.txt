my 7yearold daughter loved it as disney execs crassly calculated that she would thats the problem with air buddies its a strictly bythenumbers childrens film filled with carefully calculated cuteness a couple politically correct morals and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded g rating as a parent or even as a 10yearold youve seen it all before and done better before think 101 dalmatians meets home alone and you get the general idea im of the opinion that a good childrens story is a good story period air buddies which is about as original as recycled paper fails to meet that standard it isnt the worst video your child could watch but there are megatons of better ones
