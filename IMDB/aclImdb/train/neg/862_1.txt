succubus the edited version of necronomicon geträumte sünden is a struggle to sit through even at a lean 76 minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a comabr br jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever apparently this is one of the better of his 180 films  its hard to believe that there are worse efforts out therebr br the unfathomable plot deals with francos usual themes of sex violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of sm for good measure and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tediousbr br i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this
