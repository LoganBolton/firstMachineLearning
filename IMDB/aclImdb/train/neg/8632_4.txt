i am a huge charlton heston fan he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time but what was he thinking when he made this movie normally if he made a bad movie i could blame it on the screenwriter or director but in this case its all him the suckiness of this movie is all his fault it proves that not even heston can make a shakespeare story interesting i wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and ill never get that time back this is by far the worst heston movie that ive ever seen if you are a shakespeare fan maybe youll find this movie entertaining but if youre not dont waste your time youll regret it in the long run
