i watched 34 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here it was fairly easy to watch at 3am it had good casting  kevin dillons role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable  he was both charasmatic and chilling the rest of the main characters werent so bad eitherbr br this is your typical stalkersuspense movie a married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help a sociopathic genetic material donor fixates on the recipients and in typical stalker form intrudes into their livesbr br as i said most of the movie was fairly good we see conan grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother of course things dont work out for him the way he planned not a bad plot linebr br but the last 15 minutes were just horrible i am pretty tolerant with movies especially at 3am but i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written i actually scoffed outloudbr br all in all not the worst movie ive seen but i wouldnt be able to sit through it again unless i skipped the ending the only redeaming quality here was kevin dillons role   one of the best serial killers everbr br try looking around at the other channels before watching this but if nothing better is on id give it a try
