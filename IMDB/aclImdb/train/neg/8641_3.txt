grand central murder 1942 dir s sylvan simon br br production mgm br br this mediocre b mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with simon as director surely he could have fit another red skelton film or two on his schedule anyway grand central murder is a shameless ripoff of the thin man films minus the wit charm and chemistry of the leads we are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes bad acting and weary gagsbr br van heflin and virginia grey play nick and nora charer rocky and butch custer hes a pi and shes his wife and sleuthing partner they engage in humorous banter with each other see its completely different already heflins the only one here who hints at bigger and better things although hes real close to being a jerk in this virginia grey was in another thin man but again let me stress this film is nothing like that one no sir and just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film say the thin man we actually like sam levene pops up as the lead detective whos kind of dim and has to have van heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads hmmmbr br quickly the murder is that of bitchy schemer mida king who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one shes played by patricia dane whos like a c version of hedy lamarr until she opens her mouth and turns into an f theres a whole array of wacky suspects all with their own motivation for wanting mida dead theres the society type the tough talking dames the thug the exlover and a shady theater impresario tom conway here saddled with the unlikely character name of frankie ciro roman bohnen plays a nervous jittery type something i believe he may have done before millard mitchell plays an idiot cop who in a running gag that wont quit cant stop thinking about the piece of ass hes got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up thats right millard mitchell swordsman finally in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling something weve never seen before all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories as flashbacks to the detective as rocky takes mental notes until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confessionbr br on top of the actual picture being a dud i naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942era grand central but alas no theres merely one very brief shot at the beginning thanks for nothing grand central murder so to sum up a wee bit formulaic but heflin was okaybr br Â½ out of 4
