i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the handsdown worst film ive seen this year worse than even catwoman  which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fictionbr br in september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan  despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wifes death on sept 11  to track down osama bin ladenbr br they made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentarybr br the psychotic idiotic protagonist  who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver  cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i dont know why he didnt just wear a sign on his back that said shoot mebr br the crews translator supposedly their sensible voiceofreason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom br br you wish theyd brought along someone on their trip to call them all moronsbr br around tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew
