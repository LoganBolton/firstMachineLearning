amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought  documentary camera operators neednt spin around all the timebr br the script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering  with some gaping holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected alquada operatives and thus get an interview with osama i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the filmmakerlead role really portrays a rash idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location its truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interestingbr br who financed this crap
