well basically the movie blows its blair witch meets sean penns ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the war on terror is really about the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader no offense to 8th graders the two main actors overact the entire film they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of filmnot that i know anything about those thingsbut it just didnt look like real documentaries ive watched and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd id rather watch the blair witch viii than sit through that again
