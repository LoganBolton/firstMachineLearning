even though theres a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from this succubus is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts succubus among his personal favorites so maybe its me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage its all downhill from here unfortunately reynauds character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasnt for the lame and uninteresting story its supposed to be psychedelic but id say sophomoric is a better term to describe whats shown here half of the time you dont have a clue whats going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isnt francos best film according to me i wouldnt even recommend it to diehard exploitation fans if youre looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on las vampiras the awful dr orloff or female vampire
