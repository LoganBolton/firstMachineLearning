if it wasnt for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this documentary i would never have seen this comedy this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments one in particular is where the afghan police  soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away still filming presumably to his plush hotel then theres the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosionbr br i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has 58  10 i thought imdb users had more sense
