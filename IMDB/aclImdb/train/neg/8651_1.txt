i watched the first 15 minutes thinking it was a real documentary with an irritatingly overly dramatic on camera producerbr br when i realized it was all staged i thought why would i want to waste my time watching this junk so i turned it off and came online to warn other people the characters dont act in a believable way too much immature emotion for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country he acted like a kid and i dont believe it was because his character was so upset about the trade center bombingsbr br very trite and stupidbr br have you seen city of lost children french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams i liked it
