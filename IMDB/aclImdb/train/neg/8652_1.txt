i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one but when i started with it i found it really awful they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think 95 of the movie is shot in india you can see indian made cars you can see lars drinking bislerian indian water brand hindi written on the road you can also see temples in afghanistan hahah its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan i think one should not waste hisher time watching this movie pure time waste i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but dont watch this waste of time
