i went into this hoping it would be the thought provoking little gem people have reviewed this as i love indy films and expected to dig this too knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained maybe even see an outsiders perspectivebr br all i can say is wowif your into self torture or mutilation then maybe youll like this personally i dont like the idea of being peed on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage bad script bad acting bad story bad directing bad editingi could go on i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 thats misleading and ignorant voting for a movie on imdb isnt setting a precedent it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as its controversial this film is not it tries very hard to be but fails br br you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically unfortunately they do die but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured br br do yourself a favor just dont even bother i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for 50 and feel ripped off
