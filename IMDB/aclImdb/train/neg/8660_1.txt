this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen it follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes the monster looks way to much like a dinosaur having big tyranosaurouslike hind legs when it should just look like an oversized crocodile everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes cliche minute after minute why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate plus theres always a guy and girl who share a lame obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations to much has already been said by me and i feel as if im wasting my time writing this
