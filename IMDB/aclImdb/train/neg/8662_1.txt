what an awful movie i love monster flicks but i couldnt watch even half of the terrible acting cardboard characters and abysmal special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie the characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous uninspiring sock puppets the plot is formulaic cut and paste standard sciencerunamok drivel even the cgi is horrible you know its bad when you cant even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy no surprises herejust same old same old this is truly one of the worst films ever made director roger corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata
