this tvmade thriller is all talk little action it works hard to set up its convoluted plot yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best by the end i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning it has a quasiten little indians scenario but ditches it midway through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer field overacts here with a gracelessness ive seldom seen from her the early introductions are good but the writing quickly strays offcourse and eventually goes over the top lots of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects which adds nothing a curious failure from producers aaron spelling  leonard goldberg with all this talent couldnt they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet
