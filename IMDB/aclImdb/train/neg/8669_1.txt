first and foremost i loved the novel by ray bradbury its the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later it was one of his best books with you know fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine i as just hoping that this movie would be all right it had lots of chances with a great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even wrote the script himself and on top of all that it has pam grierbr br how could it failbr br there may be spoilers withinbr br first of all it was dumbed down much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the bookgone everything that made you squirmgonebr br and then theres the acting like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this bugged me a lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 their strong friendship wasnt addressed it was more like they were acquaintaces br br youd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr halloway and mr dark but here its like they just dont care all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something this is far from being some of their best performances br br pam grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasnt well pulled off shes a lot less evil and doesnt have the presence as she did in the book br br and everything that was left out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jims house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr coogan on the merrygoround the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more br br and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasnt really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything br br i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood boil dont see this movie but read the book its a classic of bradbury
