plan b is strictly bythenumbers fare except for one thing i surprisingly found it to be rather insultingbr br jon cryer is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy egotistical snotty character that was actually endearing in pretty in pink and has not been amusing ever since grating doesnt even begin to describe his performance ricky mark matheisen is a muscular blonde struggling actor who gasp is only worried about his hair and getting laid talk about a stock characterugh at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging lisa darr and lance guest play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to conceive since they are not whiny drama queens however their roles are apparently considered boring and they arent given enough screen time sara mornell rounds out the cast by playing gina your usual nice and goodlooking young woman who just cant seem to find the right partner in love ive seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situationbr br what startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked he was portrayed as being wild ignorant and amazingly shallow they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays gina decides to be gay for a while since she isnt having any luck with guys honestly that wasnt that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing her lesbian date had very short hair like im sure all lesbians do she also got quite upset like im sure all lesbians do when gina had the nerve to put on lipstick finally her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment of course we all know how gay people cant stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years right please note the sarcasm in that statement thank youbr br this film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but cryers unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema 210
