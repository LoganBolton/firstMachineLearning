i liked chiba in street fighter and i figured hey no matter how stupid this movie will be ill at least get to see him kick some ass right wrong this is a dull dreary mess of pointless talking halfassed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming there are few action scenes of any kind even fewer martial arts scenes and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you cant even make out what in the world is going on the dub is also atrocious and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia except theyre all japanese avoid like the plagueyou would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes
