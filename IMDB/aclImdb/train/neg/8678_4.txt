after watching the bodyguard last night i felt compelled to write a review of itbr br this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camerawork it was beyond annoying the angles were all wrong it was impossible to see anything especially during the fight sequences the closeups were even horriblebr br the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring he is approached by judy lee who is never quite straight with chiba lees involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought as the mob and another gang of thugs are after herbr br the story was decent and despite horrible dubbing this could have been a good movie given better direction and editing im sure this would have been a classic kung foo movie as it is its more like another cheesy 70s action moviebr br note the opening sequence has a quote familiar to pulp fiction fans and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the moviebr br rating 4 out of 10
