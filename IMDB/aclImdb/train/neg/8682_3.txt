i want to start by stating i am a republican even though i dont agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office and i love the daily show and colbert report they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv i enjoy the bush jokes on conan letterman leno because i admit that w is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earthi do believe hes not the dumbest either but it comes to a point when enough is enough and its not really that funny anymore i see where it can be funny and it ishey hes making fun of our authority figure hes hilarious comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him i mean maybe one special episode but an entire series is just dumb it seems cc is just saying the same bush jokes that weve heard way to many times i really cannot see this show going past 1 season
