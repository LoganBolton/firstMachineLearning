this show is not clever thats basically what it boils down to the original humor that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny in another comment someone quotes a couple hilarious lines the standout for me was george hw bush telling the kids theyre not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news wow i thought the episodes i saw were bad the fact that this line is a high point for the series is patheticbr br my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season im a liberal republican and i know bush hasnt been a good president we all do but thats no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind meet the spartans their formula bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing creditbr br again just plain bad unfunny and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after 3 solid seasons please dont watch this crap unless youre one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold br br oh and the voice of bush sucks all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences at least south park admits the voices arent accurate if you want funny political satire watch daily showcolbert or look for any political sketches on robot chicken which is fun to watch since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube priceless
