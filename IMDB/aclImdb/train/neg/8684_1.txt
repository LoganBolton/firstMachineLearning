abysmal with a capital a this has got to be one of if not the unfunniest show on tv right now im about as antibush as it gets but this show doesnt even get a chuckle out of me what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not youll like this piece of crap show the jokes are not funny at all for example in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head welcome to camp alqaeeda there is nothing funny about that is it even supposed to be joke the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show hyping it up were funnier than the show itself and thats just sad hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season it shouldnt even have had a first
