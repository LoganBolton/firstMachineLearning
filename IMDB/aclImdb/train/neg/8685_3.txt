honestly my expectations for little bush were low i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun but rehashed and overdone bush jokes apparently i should have lowered my expectations even morebr br the writing was absolutely pathetic aside from the cheneychickeneating joke and some gigglylittle swipes it was really boring and unfunnybr br the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteenyear olds flash project its disgraceful that they used macromedias product for this because its capable of so much morebr br i dont like bush that much and i enjoy a bushjoke as much as the next guy but this was just a halfhour swipe at the president with several painfully unfunny moments trey parker and matt stone did so much more with thats my bushbr br do yourself a favor skip lil bush and go buy a copy of the shortlived comedy thats my bush youll thank me
