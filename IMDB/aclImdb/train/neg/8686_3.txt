i am marking this as a spoiler only because of some of my comments of the shows content not to the content itselfbr br as i read the comments it is apparent that those republicans somehow tolerate the show but disdain it while the democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness one reader even so it seems actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when bush was in grade schoolbr br but as to the content as i see it trying to be neutral is that the group that made this series must actually be really bush haters in the episode that i saw last s02e03 it showed that the program must have been put together long before mccain became the front runner for the nomination because the other former front runners are all featuredbr br another thing that caught my attention was the use of add in closets i thought that the series must have been made in europe of for sure not in the usa because i know of no home the usa that does not have built in closets and most likely in the homes of the artistsbr br as i watch the show yes i do get caught up in it i am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our president sure there are problems as most american will agree but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network so that if obama or hillary got in would they continue to produce and air the same sort of humor about thembr br just one more comment on a commentators remarks if there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000 according to that writer he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president wow wishful thinking on his part as far as 911 events i do believe that it was set in motion back when clinton was president and i cant see how if gore was president anything would be much different
