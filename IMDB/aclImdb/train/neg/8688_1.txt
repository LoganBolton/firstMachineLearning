if the only sex youve ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleadingbr br this is by far one of the most boring movies ive had the pleasure to try and watch lately i found the dvd lying around at my friends house and i made the sad mistake of not burning itbr br i am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on cspan only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on cspanbr br i think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere
