everyone involved and the audience should seek out the candidate to see how good this movie could have been what happened the south american story what were julie christie and kate capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cutouts up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance andor movie he was either disinterested which i can hardly believe or dreadfully miscast i have also liked and defended richard gere and been vilified for it but here he had no power he was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive all in all i was very disappointed i really expected much more from this director and cast if you cant find the candidate watch wag the dog again or even bulworth
