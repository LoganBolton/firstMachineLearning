if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end i cant believe the multiple stars given by others  can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when shes being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing ambers mom is laughable  im from georgia and have friends from texas  believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
