elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order adas and her acting is even worse here her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed as if she cant remember where she left her keysbr br this is an important true story so its too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message the rest of the cast is talented enough but they just cant overcome rohms tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required
