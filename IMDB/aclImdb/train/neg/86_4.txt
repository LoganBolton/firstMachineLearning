as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration
