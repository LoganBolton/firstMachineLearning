if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema if youve never seen a moving picture before youll think this movie is a child of the gods but if youve seen a movie a tv show even barney the dinosaur then you wont be very impressed by this film heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flickbr br now i like b movies i just watched the giant gila monster right before i watched this swill and i liked that movie much better it works as a b movie it has lamer dialoghokier acting cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real gila monster as the monster carno 3 just doesnt pack much of a b movie punch it has some gore and that polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming almostflaccid its the little engine that couldnt of dinosaur movies im not saying you shouldnt watch the movie br br some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained if youre one of those people then give this movie a shot
