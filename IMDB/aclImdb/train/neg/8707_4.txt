this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i rented it as a joke expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say ive never laughed so hard in my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur movie but more a movie that makes fun and doesnt mean to at all of the action genre i didnt see the first two but judging by the complexity of the plot i dont think theres to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours
