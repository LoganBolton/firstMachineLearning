like all carnosaur movies this is a joke the way the dinosaurs move reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls because they cannot be any stiffer or more fakelooking than they werebr br the plot had no sense whatsoever i mean first theyre on a bus then in a warehouse then all of a sudden theyre on a boat and lets be serious does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals and now they can fit on a moving van it sounds stupid even when you think about itbr br the only reason for which i gave this a 3 is because its still entertaining i found it better than the first one havent watched the second yet just dont rent it i saw it on tv and its a good thing i did because i wouldnt have wanted to waste money renting it
