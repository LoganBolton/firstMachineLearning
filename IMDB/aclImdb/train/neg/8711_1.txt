ok this is the third in the series of carnosaur lets star with the dinosaur puppets in the start of the film you cant see the dinos cause when the body count starts you can only see the dinos eye vision pretty smart to hide the bad puppets and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader rance the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead bodys after the dino rampage after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream pretty creepy and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found it pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet wtf the story is simple 1 some terrorists attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there 2 they where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant trex in there how did the trex fit in there 3 rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive 4 holy jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats 5 the dinos is now on a boat in the pacific 6 strange i didnt know that the trex had a strange thing on hes neck 7 the end the film is good if you want a good laugh 510
