i dont know where to start the acting the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine i cant believe that the production staff reached a point where they said our job is done time for its release im just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films arebr br i dont know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the terrifying dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around
