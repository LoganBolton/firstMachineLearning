this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the privilege to seebr br i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldnt stop laughing from start to finishbr br the story is simple enough terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium but its actually carrying a bunch of maneating dinosaurs easy mistake to make cue a startlingly incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts they are led by colonel rance played by scott valentine a man who seems to have perfected smell the fart acting as advocated by joey in friendsbr br theres plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting but unfortunately rances team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant lumbering monsters also the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a velociraptor attacks preumably so we cant see how bad the creature effects arebr br having said all that we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off nextbr br as a jusassic park  aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaurs crotch but as ludicrous tongueincheek entertainment its a roaring success
