the third installment of the carnosaur trilogy features a bunch of keystone kopsquality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a trex i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy it really cant be taken seriously more significantly however watching this movie i cant help but notice some interesting parallels between the carnosaur and xtro trilogies the first installment in both franchises is a dark disturbing film that has become a cult classic the second is an alien ripoff and the third is a tongueincheek almost slapstick whether intentional or not movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing also like the xtro franchise all the carnosaur movies are completely unrelated to one another they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the sequels i guess obviously carnosaur and xtro have two different production groups at work here but if youve seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two
