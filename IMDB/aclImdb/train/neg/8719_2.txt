well here i go with another b industry movie its sad enough to see some badly made films but i dont care if a b industry or c industry produces the film show some effort in your work the characters are really bad the acting isnt in question in this one surprise but plot is how can a tightknit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered and then go on as if nothing happened what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctors ass was give me a break
