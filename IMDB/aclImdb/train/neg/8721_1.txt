im sorry but this is just plain pathetic the little girl was a brat their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked besides it wasnt even a gator as the film would like us to believe if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile not a gator obviously they didnt hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc it is a sad excuse for a movie especially the ending i nearly fell asleep with this one
