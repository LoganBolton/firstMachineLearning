possible plot spoilersbr br i adore dennis hopper i question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000s the spreading ground this movie flat out sucks and im about to tell you whybr br this is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena one hitch theres a killer on the loose and that is bad for business the mayor makes a deal with the irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court det ed delongpre has other plans he wants this guy caught too but hes on the level and believes in the system he wants to see the system do its jobbr br that could have been pretty good it could have been riveting it was horrible first they label this guy a serial killer err no there are specific criteria and none of it fits here the bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day and i think it was 2 the second day this entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period hardly serial killer action i dont care what warped motives they give him in the end serial killers do their deed over a long time span they do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days thats a spreebr br ok that irritant aside the acting was atrocious the only name here was hopper and hes the only one who came even close to pulling off his part unfortunately hes kinda typecast to me and i think he does psycho parts much much better this just wasnt a good vehicle for hopper it didnt allow him to do what he does best which is to act all creepy its not that he did bad its that ive seen him do so much betterbr br the irish mob guy johnny gault tom mccamus  long days journey into night who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff contradiction not really he is trying to play the cold hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden boring to the max he didnt scare me he didnt inspire any emotion at all except boredom i cannot tell you how many times i checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this moviebr br the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a madefortv movie you know what i mean the poor production values low budget reuse of scenes to save costs just eh yanno but i feel like comparing this to those is an insult to thosebr br derek vanlint was both the director and cinematographer on this project he bit off more than he could chew i cant help feeling that hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend thats the only rational i can come up with this was vanlints first job as director third as cinematographer hopefully this was a learning experience for himbr br i wont ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one but i do want to say that they all dropped the ball hereeven hopper in a scene that should have been emotionally gutwrenching for the detective it was justwell blah i didnt see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gearchange this guy made very disappointingbr br this 100 grueling minutes long and rated r for violence and language no kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this so no worries there its not suitable for anyone anyway hehbr br skip this one youll thank me later
