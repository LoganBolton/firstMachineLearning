this movie kinda let me down it seemed a lot like the movie jaws when the hopper was telling the mayor to close parks was like when roy shider was telling the mayor to close the beaches they both said no way its summer but the box says hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one but he really doesnt do anything too interesting or exciting im not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case they just say lets do police work and well solve it and whats up with all the old men with pool cues i didnt even begin to believe that they were mob bosses and then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer with his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his dik is the size of a schoolbus come on what cruddy lines i thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies i got this movie used and wouldnt buy it new i suggest you skip this movie oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee
