the movie had a good concept but the execution just didnt live up to itbr br what is this concept well storywise its dirty harry meets m a child killer has begun terrorizing a city the lead detectives dennis hopper and frederic forest have never dealt with a serial killer before the mayor and the police chief in desperation secretly hire the local mob to speed things upto go places and do things that the police wouldnt be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possiblebr br to be fair this film does genuinely have some good things to offerbr br besides the concept i liked the look of the killers hideout norman bates has his basement this guy has an eerie sewer in some of the shots the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls often giving these scenes a creepy dreamlike qualitybr br the acting was good too dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with agebr br once you get past that however it moreorless goes downhillbr br the film is paced way too fast the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating this could have been fixed in two ways either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mysterybr br for an example of how bad this is one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this at one point in his life the suspect went to a pet shopthats rightim being totally serious here its like they went from point a the first clue to point z the suspect and skipped over all the inbetween stepsbr br then theres the characters the only ones i actually liked were two pickpockets you meet about halfway through the movie considering that theyre minor characters id call that a bad signbr br finally theres the mob angle this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i coughed up the 3 to buy the dvd in the first place i mean what a hook theres been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 1015 years the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest but it didntbr br i figured the gangsterss methods would be brutal but fun and thrilling at the same time kind of like a vigilante movie or somethingmaybe theyd even throw in some heist movie elements too we are talking about criminals after all instead were given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid the detectives question witnesses what does the mob do they interrogate and kill them its not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer theyre huntingbr br unless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest id say give this one a miss maybe some day theyll reuse the same story idea and do it right i hope so i hate to see such a good concept go to waste
