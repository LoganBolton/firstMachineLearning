dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree but in this movie hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield once i got into the plot of the movie i was hooked but its just the little things that ultimately murdered the filmbr br the concept of the film is great  not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer huntbr br thats about all that is good you can say about the film although hopper did try to act like a tough experienced street smart cop i cant help but feel his acting was below par and there wasnt enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case the directing was also terrible  it didnt have the feel of a true film but rather a tvmovie production this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion the acting was weak predictable and terribly unexciting thats when i knew that 1st of all the action is going to be atrociousbr br the angling of the camera was amateurish and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killers little sister had no true distinctive effect if it was supposed to be scary it wasnt everyones acting was terrible and even for hopper i didnt feel for his character and i just didnt really care too much about his relationship with his daughterbr br the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team once i saw the swat team in action i was thinking finally something good but i was wrong 1st of all the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys that is just impossible 2nd of all apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their hka4 submachine guns with one hand had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun these 4 idiots wouldve been blown to bits because they werent even aiming at anything or paying close attention they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward but it just looks like theyre not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around 3rd swat team members do not yell out commands such as keep your eyes open watch out for yourselves are we good to goetc in reality they use hand signals or have radios but theyre literally yelling at each other  how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear youre coming and to top it all off these guys have no plan  apparently theyre just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase eventually they end up doing nothing that was the last straw im no expert on special forces but basically what ive just outlined is pretty common sense when the audience knows the movie is terrible the action pretty much becomes the lifesaver of the movie  when you cant even make an effort to make the action great the movie is lostbr br i give 2 stars for the concept but the rest cannot be credited if you want to watch a crime thriller dont bother with this one theres plenty of crime in the movie  but it has the lack of thrill
