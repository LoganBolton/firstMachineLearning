my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile the movie is not supposed to be funny at all but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever first phillippe i forget what his character is called and i dont really care uses his regular employee id to go through all the topsecurity terminals not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the soscary legoroom which hosts the super computers this is plain funny the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room the ending like all else is very very very cheesy especially when the bad guys lawyer shows up right on time anyway this movie is a good laugh if you need something to make fun of definitely see it
