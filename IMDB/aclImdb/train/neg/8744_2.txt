i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie im still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didnt quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood clich√© imaginable all the while flogging us with the corporations are the ultimate evil message subtlety this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide its own spoilersbr br the story appears to be a computer nerds fantasy world come true the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker i think among many other nerdfantasycometrue elements that youll have to see for yourselfbr br as well i shouldve known it would be a zmovie when i saw ned bellamy he tends to be a good tipoffbr br cant recommend this one im afraid
