obvious attack on microsoft made by people who dont appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generallybr br loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and leftbr br while microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times its unlikely they actually murder people therefore the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginningbr br the deeper point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws however this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives and rewards provided by intellectual propertybr br its one thing to be opposed to anticompetitive conduct  thats common sense its quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place which is what the films mantra knowledge belongs to mankind representsbr br yet another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality
