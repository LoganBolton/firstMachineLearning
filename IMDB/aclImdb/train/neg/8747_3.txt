antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook but the director cut out her best scenes in the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie she is involved in a subplot that is simular to a subplot in get carter but she handles the subplot better in get carteri blame the director the directors homage to hitchcock was corny its the scene were ryan philippes charactor realizes he may not be able to trust tim robbins charactor at least i think its a homage to hitchcock the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences
