i watched this movie really late last night and usually if its late then im pretty forgiving of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know its suppose to be a comedy but i didnt find it very funny it was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country life is like its definitely not i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it its just too annoying
