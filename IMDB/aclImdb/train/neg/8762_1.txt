a scientist john carradinesadly finds out how to bring the dead back to life however they come back with faces of marble eventually this all leads to disasterbr br boring totally predictable 1940s outing this scared me silly when i was a kid but just bores me now i had to struggle to stay awake with one exception the acting is horrible such expressionless boring actors hopelessbr br there are some good things about this carradine despite the script actually gives a very good performance and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great dane walking through walls theres also one of the worstlooking knockouts in cinema history still none of this is fun enough to sit through this avoid
