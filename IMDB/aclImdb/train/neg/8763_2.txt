i thought i read somewhere that this was the last monogram production but whether thats true or not it doesnt matter because if it wasnt then it should have been its a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice robert shayne in bringing the dead back to life every time their subjects are revived they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table big deal carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after its dead and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion wooooooooohhhh thats about all she wrotebr br for an ultracheap monogram quickie this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancyschmancy lab setup than is usually allotted the funniest running joke in the movie is that the older doctor carradine constantly refers to his young assistant shayne as mboy when in fact carradine was actually 40 and shayne was 45 when they made this
