is this the movie is this what indians are trying to show i think this is one more effort from a sickminded director to turn down pakistani soldiers and in fact countrybut what we pakistanis know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our livesnot only in armed countersbr br wellthis is bad filmed as that of border in early 1997and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in kargil by pakistani armed forces by creating films like thesebr br one thing is very clearwhenever there will be an encounter between pakistan and indiawe will win so mr dutta try to make some good movies instead of nonsense movies like this
