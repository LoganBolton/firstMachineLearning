this film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure it had 30 actors after jaani dushman2002 i guess no one had the guts to do something like thatbr br the film as the title suggests is based on the kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boringbr br even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes wonder which soldier does thatbr br direction by jp dutta pales front of border music is okaybr br amongst the huge cast ajay devgan stands tall saif is very good in his part and also its his first film with kareena abhishek is likable manoj bajpai has his moments sanju is wasted suneil is okay akshaye khanna does his part well rest are passable rani is good esha is okay rest are passable
