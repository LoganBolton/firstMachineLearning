okay i struggled to set aside the fact that in selling evp as real the movie was basically lying to me from the getgo i reasoned that hell i dont believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with thisbr br however even with that accepted the movie is just not very good its competently made and acted but it doesnt really capture you at all there are several jump moments and i just looked at them and thought yeah i didnt expect that without actually jumping in the slightestbr br also the resolution doesnt make sense if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be then why the hell does it need to use a proxy plus the end caption was absurd they obviously put it there as part of the give the movie credibility by claiming its all real thing but for that to work it really needs to be at the start but they cant put it at the start because then they give the plot away sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb
