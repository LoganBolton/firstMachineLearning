i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenagerbr br private lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention its just a regular softcore cinemax flick that wont make a change in your life theres just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but thats it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core flickbr br the women are hot but thats not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable
