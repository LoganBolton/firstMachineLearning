jonathan rivers michael keaton suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies soon after hes approached by a dr price an expert in electronic voice phenomena evp who claims hes been receiving messages from jonathans departed wife anna via sundry electronic gadgets is anna trying to tell jonathan something is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale its good to see keaton in a leading role but the story hes stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points its as if the movie doesnt know how to answer any of the questions it brings up so it just distracts the viewer with new unrelated questionsbr br keaton himself is pretty good convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife hes matured quite a bit as an actor leaving behind the fratfriendly waackyhijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier he looks a little craggy with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect but hes lost none of the guile and panache that hes shown during his quarter century in hollywoodbr br so its not that keaton turns in a mediocre performance its that the script itself is subpar written by niall johnson the plot gets more confusing as it progresses each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path this is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement something that ties more or less everything together and explains something but not white noise i knew less about what had happened to jonathan than i did before id first seen himbr br keatons really the only reason to watch this junk although he gets fine support from ian mcneice as dr price and deborah kara unger as the requisite love interest
