i saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release and man did it look scary especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon i was incredibly interested and thought that this could finally be a decent horrorthriller film after years if crap well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements the advertisements for the movie did both which lead to my ultimate disappointmentbr br by no means is this the most disturbing movie in years hell i doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that weeks release this movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too farbr br this movie wasnt complete crap i must admit it held my interest and micheal keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means other than that though this film is one big cliché after johns wife dies he learns about evp which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances he all of the sudden receives messages from his wife my god its not just his wife reaching him its other dead people gee imagine that a movie about helping dead people come on give me a break the clichés dont stop there theres also the obligatory clockstoppingatthesameexacttimeeverynight trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero not only was the movie cliché it wasnt scary the film literally had two jump scenes and those two scenes are almost identical the ending is horrible as it leaves the door wide open for a sequel theres also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of x voices heard through evp are threatening with a nice happy tune playing way to break the mood you guys jeez in the end if you want another forgettable horror film see white noise the only reasons i could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a keaton fan or that they are interested in evp sure the evp aspects may be slightly interesting but i dont like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face this film tries to be scary original and disturbing but its just the opposite you know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film i will see this film no more
