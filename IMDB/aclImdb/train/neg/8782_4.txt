john rivers life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car during the days she has been missing he confronts a man thats been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the otherside through evp  electronic voice phenomenon naturally he doesnt believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about evp soon enough john is hooked onto it but something supernatural doesnt like him interfering with the dead as now other then contacting his wife the white noise is foretelling events before they happenbr br since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasnt my copy but then again i dont think the owners were in a hurry to get it back as they havent question me about it oh well so i decided to give it a play as i was in an undemanding mood after hearing and reading all the bad press on it i wasnt expecting anything remotely good but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes well more so the 60 minutes as the last halfanhour was pretty much a blur of confusion the film is nowhere as good as it could have been but the time breezed by quick enough even though its a rather tepid supernatural thriller i thought it wasnt all a waste the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and theres a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film thats when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesnt fit in with the context it becomes rather hectic loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camerawork that gets to close into the action i couldnt understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey its a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big but hits rock bottom i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camerawork other then the distinctively stark lighting the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware which makes it come across as very sterile and emptybr br you can easily see that the films heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story theres just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material after a while it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many bloodcurdling stuff from beyond the grave it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while the evp machine was the star on the show well it did have more impact than the limp performances michael keaton is more than capable actor but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers he really deserves much better though everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable not because of the performances but of the lack of depth in their characters this clunker wasnt bad to begin with but it does go pear shape by falling away drasticallybr br i wouldnt care to see it again and i wouldnt recommend to anyone unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horrorthrillers its just a damn shame that this overproduced flick couldnt put it together successfully as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand i didnt hate it but what a disappointment
