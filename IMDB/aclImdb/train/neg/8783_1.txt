i dont think ive ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total copout trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothings there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters halfformed story lines the characters werent well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and im just here to warn you all of that
