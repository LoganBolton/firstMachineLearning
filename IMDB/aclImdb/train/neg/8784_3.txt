the idea was awesome the actors were incredible the story could of been very scary but the writing was poor and there was no depth i couldnt really get into this movie i couldnt feel for the characters there were a lot of cliffhangers and the movie just ends very weirdly was it a happy ending i dont know was it a sad ending again i dont know you leave the theater feeling unsatisfied the movie had so much to give but couldnt just because you can edit doesnt mean you should right i wouldnt really recommend this movie because you just cant say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed youll just be confused trust me you will probably thank me if you dont watch this moviebr br 310
