absolutely one of the worst movies of the year the plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise irritatingly stupid it all begins when michael keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since batman loses his beautiful author wife anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible vw bugs even though shes supposed to be rich in his grief batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby recording nothing and then watching it he learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his tv pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to evp or electronic voice phenomenon which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders video cameras dead cell phones anna cell calling but shesdeadmust be ghosts mhmmm no other possible explanation id better start messing around with this indiscriminately etc why they cant just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained anyway eventually batman discovers that hes actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he doesnt know he gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves dmn it can travel between the living and dead using electronics but ill be dmned if we can be on time am i right guys they nod in bemused agreement he tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie look hard or youll miss him is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in raiders of the lost ark style swoop down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are just then some detectives show up and save the lady after batmans funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of evp is to expose him to it the little kid just smiles nothing phases that dude not even when his dad batman of course starts talking to tvs the highpoint of the movie was when someones phone rang and some guy yelled out its anna
