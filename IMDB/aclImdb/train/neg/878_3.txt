i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and cowrote such excellent screenplays as adams rib and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote andor directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clich√©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated the script sinks to its nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssens character tests drivass character to make sure hes not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun
