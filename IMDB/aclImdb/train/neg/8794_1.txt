i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked let alone held in such high regard especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite sensiblebr br there is one key word which describes this film to its core  irritatingbr br the most easily explained example of this is the directors use  or more accurately abuse  of music in the first half a really dull reggae tune is played about three times when once is too often but in the second half the mommas and the papas california dreamin is played at least seven times usually at top volume godsakes whether you liked the song or not beforehand youd be thoroughly sick of it by the end just think some people claim to have seen this film four or five times this means theyve listened to california dreamin either 28 or 35 timesbr br all of this needless hyperrepetition it contributes nothing to the story could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit or if the story was in any way involvingbr br but it aintbr br the only aspect i found likeable was bridgette lins charging around and still playing asia the invincible in a raincoat and sunnies even this wore off fairly quicklybr br im sure this films undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see itbr br i can only warn you  if youve never seen a hk movie before dont start with this onebr br if you feel compelled to watch it avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema the fastforward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival herebr br you have been warned
