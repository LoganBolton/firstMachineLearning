i like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story this doesnt occur in this movie its a series of vignettes with no cohesionbr br there are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans a woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses this woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why she disappears completely after about 30 minutes there is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a mans apartment there are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the mamas  papas california dreaming is vastly overplayed i used to like the song the dialogue is mostly concerned with food pineapples chefs salad and ordering drinks i assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumedbr br there is no passion in this movie because there is no story this is purportedly a romance  it is no such thing i just wonder why i didnt hit the fastforward i kept waiting for something significant to happen  it doesnt maybe thats the only consolation to this movie  scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense
