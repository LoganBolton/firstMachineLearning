i have read all of the love come softly books knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the bookbut generally they at least have the main point of the book i was highly disappointed in this movie the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missys father comes to visitalthough in the book both parents come that is all the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes sad from the book that i just couldnt enjoy it even if i didnt read the book it was too sad i do know that pioneer life was roughbut the whole movie was a downer the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great
