pieced edited together from dead body parts deleted scenes from corpses anchorman the frankenstein monster wake up ron burgundy is definitely not a sight for sore eyes something youd ever want to watch twicemaybe even once for that matterbr br more often than not the relativity of the scenes in wurb are made relevant by a third person narrator even more troubling is that the characters in wurb are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of anchorman in opening narration were told wurb takes place shortly after the original at the end of anchorman burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid coanchorwomanlover in this film hes back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to veronica quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original anchorman spliced in to wurb br br the part that makes this a movie a continually evolving story involves a bankrobbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock these scenes are almost painful to sit through this part was scrapped from the original scripts for anchormanbr br the majority of other scenes involving our channel 4 news team are clearly alternatedeleted takes on scenes from anchorman they go to the same party as in the original the same original group bitching about having a woman on the team scene and the same cat fashion show segment that veronica had objections to reportingbr br burgundy recreates their first date with the drivein spot overlooking san diego and dinner at his favorite club tinos neither character make mention that theyve been to the drivein spot before and when burgundy walks into tinos with veronica he introduces it to her as though theyve never been before oh and theyre wearing the same clothes as on their original datebr br still i have to give some credit to the filmmakers  even if wurb is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration between the two ron burgundy stories  this is the weaker one looking back on it its quite a feat for anchorman to have risen from the ashes of wurb you stay classy imdb thanks for stopping by
