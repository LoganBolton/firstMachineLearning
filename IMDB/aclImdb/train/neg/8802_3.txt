look i loved the proper anchorman film but this was reaaaaallly bad the kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life the kind of bad that makes you think what on earth were they thinking to film this in the first place the kind of bad that makes you wish youd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a pauly shore film insteadseriously i cannot explain how very bad this wasbr br having said thatthere were some semiamusing laughs but they are all so much less funny than anchorman sure they tried to make it entertaining and fun but the entire subplot that was left out of anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reasonit wasnt even a little bit goodbr br do yourself a favour or in the usa a favor and dont watch this dvdit will tarnish the good movie that anchorman is and you dont want to do thatbr br okayim alright now
