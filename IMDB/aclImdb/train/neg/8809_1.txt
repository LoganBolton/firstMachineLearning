a bunch of women who cant act sit around talk smoke pot they have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some storebought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers we dont see them killing anyone suddenly there is a body on the floor covered by a bloodied sheet i cant eat spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this just the thought of spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is hunting them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the sitonthecouch sisters is never explained there are also scenes of some superhuman guy freaking out he pes blood and punches through a wall but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the storybr br there is no action no special effects no story if you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking then heres 90 minutes of that because except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes absolutely nothing happens yawn oh i almost forgot you get to see them move some stuff including the deformed sister when they move to their new apartment its one of the few times theyre not sitting on a couch or lying in bed
