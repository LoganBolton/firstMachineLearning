this movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece even better than say gosford park then it inexplicably slows down loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between antoine depardieu and cécile deneuve in the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story several threads started are not endedbr br spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between antoine and cécile he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago despite her remarrying and setting up home in morocco as builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of céciles marriage having accomplished this he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a comatose he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that theyve reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together end of spoilersbr br it remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here illegal immigrants want to enter europe there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of iraqs former regime céciles child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that her sister is traditional islamic and enters a relation with céciles husband it portrays morocco as unnecessary backward despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past it portrays islam as backward and prone to extremism which may sometimes be true but certainly not in general in the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and lart pour lartbr br deneuve and depardieu are great with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene lifting an eyebrow body language radiating pride awkward behavior the movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays with some notable exceptions of course
