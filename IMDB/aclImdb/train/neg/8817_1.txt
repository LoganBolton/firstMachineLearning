no ive never seen any of the santa slasher series ie silent night deadly night the original black christmas or this one christmas evil ive heard all about their reputation or mads mothers against deranged santas i thought i would rent this one as ive heard it pop up as a reference on a fat guys at the movies segmentbr br mothers should be against this but not for the ooooohhhh killer santa but for the fact this movie was just plain crap boring long  even at only 92 minutes crapbr br little boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 deliver presents eat some goodies and miraculously float up the chimney boy goes to bed but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa sort of getting it on apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphies dad got the leg lamp in a christmas story he was sooo disturbed he went to the attic and well cut his own handbr br fast forward to the future now its 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory we get a whiff of him being a little offkilter and he stalks both kids and parents alike whos naughty whos nice blah blah it takes a good twothirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if thats not foreshadowed from frame one no movie should take that longbr br i will admit this movie had its tension building but only because i kept expecting him to do something anything to anyone when he finally does well punish whos naughty its as graphic as a garbage pail kid card and i havent mentioned the wtf ending im thinking it was a metaphor but in reality its just as weird as the rest of the movie take the brother whos upset his sibling is killing and his solution isuh killing dont open this mess even on christmas eve or evil again i didnt watch the other santaslashers but this one sucked bad it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present
