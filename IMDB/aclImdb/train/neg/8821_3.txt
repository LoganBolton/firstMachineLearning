why oh why wont they learn when youve got a nice juicy exploitation gimmick use it dont go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful youre only gonna wind up looking foolishbr br christmas evil is the story of harry stadling who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing daddydressedassanta claus back when he was a kid so of course harry grows up obsessed with christmas and finally when his disillusionment becomes too great he flips out dresses as santa and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children and viciously killing anyone he deems naughtybr br simple enough and not a bad place to start after all how many other holidaythemed horror flicks use the same schtick unfortunately this film wants to be more santa portrait of a serial killer than silent night deadly night twothirds of the film are spent documenting harrys slow but inevitable breakdown when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it alreadybr br perhaps harrys descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director but alas weve got some guy named lewis jackson apparently this is his only film and it shows the action jumps giddily from scene to scene without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeingbr br even once the film gets rolling were still treated to heaping helpings of harrys selfpity insecurity and neurotic behavior more depressing than frightening christmas evil is one to avoid
