stewart kane gabriel byrne vanity fair heads out with his local jindabyne australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest recreation and relaxation but when stewart discovers an aboriginal womans body floating facedown in a river things appear to have turned out for the worst the largest casualty of the weekend is the mens commonsense they dont hike out of the ravine and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches then they head out and report the bodybr br the town and the mens lives quickly turn into a mess the local media swarms them and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives stewarts wife claire laura linney the exorcism of emily rose senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did but has to battle with it through her own mental illnessbr br amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle splayed out on a morgue slab her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of jindabyne a division of men and women black and white social and outcastbr br the only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids stewart and claires son who is being led around by a halfbreed aussie whos mother was killed also just a few years before the young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this again the underlying current of jindabyne is surmisedbr br everything and everyone in this jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of jindabyne under its surface none that is until claire forces them tobr br the movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted there are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesnt get done too many loose threads the acting was okay but the filming was terrible wobbly cameras grainy or dark shots and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall productionbr br i enjoy symbolic films northfork being one of my alltime favorites in that vein but jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems which simply didnt happen
