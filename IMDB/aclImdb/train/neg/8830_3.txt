just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worse of all a bizarre almost hollywoodlike ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it endsbr br you will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones the conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided i didnt understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner is he  she trying to be racistbr br a truly bizare movie only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happenedbr br but on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent
