this isnt art its innerurban politicallycorrect propaganda jindabynes political intolerance is beyond unforgivable it doesnt see people as individuals but rather as members of categoriesbr br this is the most patronisingly offensive australian movie i can recall ever and its up against some pretty stiff competition a message movie every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there aborigines are victims white men are violent or alcoholics white women arent that bad particularly if they are lesbians  but theyre most likely of a depressive naturebr br four men who go away fishing find the body of a murdered woman aboriginal naturally and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout its a strange decision taken with almost no discussion as if the men are animals the one man who briefly demurs is the goodie we know this because hes living with a bisexual woman  he likes to hold his baby a lot  and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location away from all these beastly bushdwellersbr br this is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within its ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt the film is shot through with longdistance views of the bush backed by foreboding mysterious music its made very clear by the end that aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape it concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of blackwhite reconciliationbr br in jindabyne country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other australiansbr br this film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the governments film finance corporation its a product of the artsy set that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects which are as detached from real life as possible as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see it doesnt matter if the film is a stinker they still get paidbr br spare yourself from wasting time avoid it like the plague more jaded social commentary than actual entertainment this film deserves to pan
