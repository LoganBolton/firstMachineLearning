this film is terrible i was really looking forward to it as i thought lantana was greatbr br the following review may contain spoilersbr br br br first the good things it looks great some of the performances are ok the bad things are everything else about it br br the story as you possibly know is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body with the twist that they find it on friday but continue fishing and finally report it on sunday when they get back into mobile cell phone range however the film takes its time boy does it take its time getting to this central eventbr br of the ensemble of characters about a dozen not one seems to like another one which is i suppose consistent because they are all unlikable i was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related and it was not until near the end of the movie that i could vaguely construct the family tree br br its hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim which is a failure in the structure of the story as the characters lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after once youve set the bar so high its hard to upit short of everyone committing suicidebr br there are silly lapses in logic the killer dumps the body in the lake and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains the fishermen walk out sunday morning but for some reason byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station um they havent heard of the telephone down at the station the media know the whole story less than 24 hours after they reported the bodybr br totally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body this is a mystery  everyone asks them how could you do that and the audience is asking the same question the debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in deliverance i know exactly what id do in their situation someone needs to walk out to the car drive to mobile range call the cops wait and them guide them back to the location if the others wait at camp and fish who caresbr br a lot of all this just seems false the only thing that rung true was that as the girl was black the local aboriginals seized on the fishermens actions as racist  wouldnt have done it if it was a white girl br br throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl i think the subject is mentioned once and there is no mystery as the audience sees the killer in the opening scenebr br so im sitting there simultaneously bored and confused when theres a twist  not in the plot but the theme suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about blackwhite reconciliation huhbr br this is australian film at its finest according to the age
