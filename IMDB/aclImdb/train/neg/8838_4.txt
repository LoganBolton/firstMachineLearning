there are similarities between ray lawrences jindabyne and his last movie lantana Â– a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives but whereas lantana offered some hope and resolution jindabyne leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied perhaps even cheatedbr br the storyline  the aftermath of a fishermans discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river  is based on a short story by raymond carver it became an element in robert altmans classic 1993 ensemble short cuts lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small australian community under stress the movie poses some moral questions would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend and more poignantly for australians would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal the acting especially by gabriel byrne and laura linney is commendable and there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music not unlike picnic at hanging rockbr br if all this sounds like the basis for a great movie  be prepared for a let down the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning thereby eliminating the element of mystery and so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale
