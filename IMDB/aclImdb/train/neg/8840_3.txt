here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea that is the problem isnt the concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters this movie doesnt have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why first you dont really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here its suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation they are not believable in the way they act and interact example  jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isnt the way to go here i mean what is that he looks like hes on the toilet or something i loved him in reanimator and the way he was playing the intenseneurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money but not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner its not natural im surprised he didnt dislocate his jaw during filming the movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come
