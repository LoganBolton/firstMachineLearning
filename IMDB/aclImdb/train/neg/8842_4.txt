its somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes youve guessed it that film is parasomnia ive often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing  but it seems fairly transparent in this casebr br thats not to say parasomnia is terrible but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to bebr br on the plus side it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great toobr br although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story its the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly then the story is losing you and thats what kept happening to me with this film other reviewers have mentioned this here and i dont want to get into spoiler territory but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of lifebr br all in all there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special
