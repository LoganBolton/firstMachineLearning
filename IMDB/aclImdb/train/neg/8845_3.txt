i watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief description i read here after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then i looked at the other stuff hes done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this onebr br the story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because shes pretty but has the mind of a child i gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible
