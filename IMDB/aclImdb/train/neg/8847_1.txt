this us soap opera knots landing has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator every episode contained plots such as rape murder kidnapping and drug smuggling not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period as for the cast ive seen better actors on a cereal box from the mid to late 90s repeats of knots stunk up ukgold like a mountain of mildewing nappies i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously though since then reruns have been few and far between lets hope it stays that way the only positive thing that can be said of knots is the catchy saxophone signature tune later used as the title music for the itv sitcom the upper hand great legacy that eh
