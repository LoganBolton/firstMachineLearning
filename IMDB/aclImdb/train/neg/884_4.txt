new york i love you or rather shouldbetitled manhattan i love looking at your people in sometimes love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexytalk and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books while the latter isnt a great story by any stretch its at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl hes been talking to as a liaison between him and the director the ethan hawke scene however is like nothing and feels like it like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in or for that matter hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bitesbr br whats irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible stories and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another ie bits involving bradley cooper drea dematteo hayden christensen andy garcia james caan natalie portman etc its not even so much that the film set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx not even say harlem or washington heights lacks a good deal of diversity since there is some its the lack of imagination that one found in spades for better or worse in paris jtaime its mostly got little to do with new york except for passing references and at its worst the julie christieshia labeouf segment its incomprehensible on a level that is appallingbr br so basically wait for tv and do your best to dip in and out of the film  in that is for three scenes the aforementioned bloomchristina ricci segment which is charming the brett ratner directed segment yes xmen 3 brett ratner with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary everything else can be missed even natalie portmans directorial debut and the return of a hughes brother only one allan to the screen a mixed bag is putting it lightly its like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left
