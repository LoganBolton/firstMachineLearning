i have always been somewhat underwhelmed by joe dantes original the howling 1981  so i wasnt particularly interested in checking out any of its sequels some time ago i did catch howling iii the marsupials 1987  by the same director as this one  and found it to be watchable but nothing specialbr br the second instalment however has quite a bad rep and i knew id have a good time watching it  if mainly to wallow in the sight of dear but pompous horror icon christopher lee squirming in the midst of it all the gracefullyaged star has pathetically asserted a number of times in interviews that he hasnt appeared in horrororiented fare since his last picture for hammer films back in 1976 anyway this film should have borne the subtitle your movie is a turd  being astoundingly inept in all departments beginning with the allimportant werewolf makeup br br the plot and dialogue is not only terrible but it has the limpest connection with dantes film  strangely enough the author of the original novel gary brandner cowrote this himself still one of the undeniable highlights erlow points of the film is the pointless elliptical editing  which tries to give the whole a semblance of style but only serves to accentuate its embarrassment factor similarly phoney and grating are the hokey transitions between scenes the inane punkrock theme song and the cheapjack specialeffects at the climax br br what about the characters then lee is the werewolf expert naturally whom everybody thinks a crackpot  until they come into contact with the monsters that is at the very least though one has to admire the makers ingenuity or gall in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning incidentally sybil danning as stirba werewolf bitch  the subtitle by which this is known in the uk is quite fetching in an assortment of outrageous sm outfitsbut her character is virtually given nothing to do except preside over her brood of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious threeway lycanthrope sex her two snarling lieutenants one of them a sluttish black girl are especially irritatingbr br aiding lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes he being the brother of the dee wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers and a ragged guerrillatype band of transylvians still they generally manage to effortlessly overcome dannings rather dumb werewolves notable among them is a knifethrowing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty but at the same time sidesplitting demise hes later revived under stirbas control in order to lure lee by making childish taunts at him all through the village streets into a trap the latter scene has to be a career nadir for the distinguished and imposing actor  well either this or the early sequence in a discotheque where lee is made to don a pair of ultracool sunglasses so as to appear inconspicuous among the partying youngstersbr br in the end if i were forced to mention elements in this which werent entirely displeasing i guess i could say that the ossuary set in which the heroine is to be sacrificed is interesting or that the hybrid werewolfbat creature dannings pet who likes to inhabit the body of its victims is just too weird to be despised
