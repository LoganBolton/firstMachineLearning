ugly shot poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dantes 1981 classic the howling is one of the two or three only good werewolffilms ever made and yet it got rewarded by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one if its any consolation stirba is a sequel in name only and theres absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dantes film the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by stirba stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond superbabe with impressive bosom in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused her archenemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee his character  stefan crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to stirbas kingdom accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult in case youre exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nuditythis is your film even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and were even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence however if you want a little substance or depth youll be sorely disappointed the dialogues are embarrassing and theres absolutely no tension to detect anywhere the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires the transsylvanian setting garlic wooden stakes and dannings gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the films only gimmick during the endcredits a shot in which she rips off her top is reedited repeatedly according to my fellow reviewer dr gore no less than seventeen times which is pretty pathetic and pointless the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful im talking about the fiercelooking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirbas castle the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and  as far as im concerned  his only worthwhile film remains the beast within released three years earlier
