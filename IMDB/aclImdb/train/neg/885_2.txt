an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised theres a lot of talent involved here a great many talented actors directors and writers unfortunately i couldnt really enjoy this movie based on three issues i hadbr br first of all the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others br br secondly several segments feel underdeveloped to me like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition im not talking about happy endings here or even an ending period but rather they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in br br last but not least i did not feel newyork and its inhabitants were properly portrayedbr br what youre left with is highbrow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied
