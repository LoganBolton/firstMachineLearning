howling ii 1985 was a complete 180 from the first film whilst the first film was campy and creepy the second one was sleazy and cheesy the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis the scene from the first film was badly recreated a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro reb brown to the old country romania to uncover the mystery to her sisters murdertransformationdeath christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sageguide to the two sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba the head werewolf of the romania she also suffers from a bad case of morning face ewwwbr br bad movie theres nothing good about this stinker im surprise philippe mora directed this picture because hes usually a good filmmaker the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it no not the content but the film stock itself to round the movie off you get a lousy punk performance from a damned wannabe babel maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they couldve got the real deal instead of an imitationbr br best to avoid unless youre desperate or you lost the remote and youre too lazy to change the channel
