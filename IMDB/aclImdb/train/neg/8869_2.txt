with the releasing of farligt förflutet swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom stefan jens hultén has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife marie regina lund one day an old friend of stefan´s arrives with a favor to ask him stefan is to do a small courier job he is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the swedengermany customs unfortunately things in germany don´t work out as planned and stefan is now in big trouble it is always nice to see a swedish film that breaks the traditional familydrama pattern unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic the content can be concluded with bad acting an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs the only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sexscene wit the incredibly beautiful regina lund this lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure let´s say what it truly is crap
