but there are not too many of them probably the worst major release film i have seen in my life definitely the worst for this year there is no point in commenting on the plot the cast or the acting the problem is beyond all that it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind not the funny kind of everything that takes place on the screen i dont know why i gave it a 210 instead of 110 probably because of steven martini he really did try bottom line  95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells avoid at any cost
