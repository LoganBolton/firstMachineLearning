following the success of paris je taime a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york unlike the original film the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quicklyby the time you think are getting into a story its over in too many cases and the often start up and stop and then begin againwith the stories woven together as a result there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structurebr br sadly however while paris je taime was hit or miss mostly hit most of new york i love you was miss the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweetand often quite terrible it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional storiesand perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so now understand it was good quality music but its somber tone really really made me feel like cutting my wrists among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the crotchety old couple this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so muchand i really wanted to love this film i respected what they tried but simply didnt like it very muchbr br by the way and this is not really a complaint but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film for a recent film that was unusual in our more antismoking culturebr br also if you get the dvd there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film one consists of kevin bacon wearing a cool fedora eating a hotdogand absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the worldincluding a very unhappy couple
