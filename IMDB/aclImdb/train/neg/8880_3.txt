this movie was ok but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there arent enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through  not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable  that is the reason why i rated it so low its watchable but dont expect anything great
