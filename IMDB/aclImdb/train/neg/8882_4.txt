to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight 1939  1944 via les diaboliques 1954 while still watchable in itself its so clich√©ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills however thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names  cliff robertson as the conniving husband jean simmons in the title role jenny agutter as robertsons artist halfsister simon ward as the enigmatic chauffeur ron moody as an illfated doctor michael jayston as robertsons business partner judy geeson as simmons best friend and jaystons wife flora robson as the housekeeper david tomlinson as the notary reading simmons will and most surprisingly perhaps jack warner as a gravestone sculptor  although most of them actually have nothing parts im sorry to say
