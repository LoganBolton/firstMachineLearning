ill have to add dissenting comment here various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiaohsien ie one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years unfortunately this isnt quite accurate the film plays out rather like a film school graduates attempt to emulate these masters all the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop the vaguely minimalist dialogue the slow swaying camerawork and male leads in particular who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par the dialogue is leaden the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical chekovian ie very predictable plot the results are at best tedious and at worst painful i couldnt help but see the blue danube river scene for example as verging on genre parody although the smoggy looking springtime sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it while the setting is elegant and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of flowers of shanghai the film is not in the same league visually in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave and i cant recall the last film i walked out of im guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i couldnt care if youd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then id recommend anything by the above two directors for example in the mood for love or flowers of shanghai both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping the former with chris doyle and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this its not often mr hoberman leads me astray and perhaps youd rather listen to him but dont say you werent warned craigbr br
