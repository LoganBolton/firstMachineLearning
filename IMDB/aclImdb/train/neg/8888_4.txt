i rated basic instinct 2 high yet that movie got less than a 4 rating this film only got a 4 from me but it has 73 from over 600 people i dont see a reason why they like this film so muchbr br this film is boring because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in that broken big house and it only has a total of 5 people in this film it is almost two hours long which is totally unnecessary many of dialogues are slow and meaningless the film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch the film can just be shorten to a few sentencesbr br this film reminds me of three times directed by hou hsiao hsien that one is equally boring the dialogues are also equally boring it also has a high rating i had to stop watching that one after the first story finishedbr br this film lacks of passion or excitement
