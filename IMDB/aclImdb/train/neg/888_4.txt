this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for startersthe movie has so little said about new yorkjust a bunch of confusing shots of buildingsstreetsbridges and cafesit really doesnt stay focused on the new york magicanother thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this moviei know that it is a remakebut it is not a french style remake anywayhere you will notice elements that remind you of french moviessuch as long and messy scenesno or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style  the story follows many lives  too many for my taste and they somehow seem connected in the end i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyones happy endingso we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes eachand there you have your 120 minutes  if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you  i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast
