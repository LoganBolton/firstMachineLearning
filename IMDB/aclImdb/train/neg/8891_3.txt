easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays it has been seriously let down here shoddy direction stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedybr br in the town of verona the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo patrick rycart a montague falls in love with juliet rebecca saire a capulet bloodshed soon eruptsbr br the studio work especially in daytime scenes seriously stagnates the energy of the play its a story that with its energy deserves to be shot outdoors coupled with this the costumes are hideous with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces the stage fighting looks horrendous with far too much stretching and running around to be engagingbr br patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo he manages the characters intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland often inexpressive eyes limit his range it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet  she captures the characters naivet√© but a little more sassiness would have been welcomebr br the supporting roles dont fare much better joseph oconnors friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut anthony andrews mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result alan rickman underplaying his role has virtually no presence as tybalt he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years but that isnt in evidence here the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera only micheal hordern in probably his best role in this series comes out of this with any dignity his capulet is wellplayed and a joy to watchbr br see one of the other versions of this story instead
