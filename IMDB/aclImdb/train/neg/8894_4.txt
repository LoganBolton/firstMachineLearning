this movie is phoniness incarnate a straight 11  10 on the phoniness scale the fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering yanks although the real scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there dont expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out controversies with the locals also dont attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancingbr br there are a couple of infectious singinganddancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18thcentury scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay new york city maybe it wasnt such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left brigadoon maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dumpbr br watch it for the fine alternativereality view of what a christopher streed dayparade in scotland would look like on lsd other than that id only recommend it to hollywood muscial completists
