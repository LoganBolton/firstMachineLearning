i remember when i first saw this movie i was in sixth grade when it happened before i saw this i had listened to the original broadway recording of it and i really loved it but when i saw this i was like what the heck this movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud who decided to do all of thatbr br i really am a very huge fan of gene kelly but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did the movie looked more like a hollywood set than the beautiful highlands of scotland and who the heck decided to cut all of megs songs out of the movie br br i am willing to bet that when they saw this movie lerner and lowe were probably wondering who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece well they had a right to say that if they did they were probably mad at the fact that hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank moviebr br song and acting wise mr kelly you passed the audition with flying colors but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the textbr br so in short if you want a good movie based on a musical by frederick lowe and alan jay lerner this one isnt it br br 310
