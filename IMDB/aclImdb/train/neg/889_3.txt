ive never been to paris but after seeing paris je taime im crazy to visit this city ive been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city theres a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesnt work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where its said to have thousands of people living on their own cant you find love in new york
