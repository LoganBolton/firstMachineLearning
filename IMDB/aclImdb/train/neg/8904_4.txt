i personally liked the prophecy of 1995 a lot christopher walken was as always great and even though the film wasnt flawless it was a creepy and highly original horrorfantasy film that entertained immensely this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching but mainly due to walken walken is one of the greatest actors around in my opinion and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel whom he plays for the second time here once again the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child namely the child of the angel danyael russel wong and the human woman valerie jennifer beals this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war as i said above christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel besides gabriel however the prophecy ii sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters the character of valerie was annoying enough and danayel annoyed me even more the biggest pain in the ass however was the character of izzy played by brittany murphy a suicidal girl who wouldnt shut up still walkens performance isnt the only redeeming quality of the film the entire film is quite dreary and wellshot in dark colors which contributes a lot to the atmosphere gabriels resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive and one of the coolest moments in any of the prophecy films the prophecy ii is nevertheless the weakest of the three prophecy films with walken definitely a christopher walken onemanshow entertaining but nothing beyond that
