everybody knows that gregory widens original the prophecy didnt really require a sequel but you also dont need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cashins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable part two is a very prototypic example of a straighttovideo sequel meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action more witty oneliners and a lot more eerie religious scenery the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental if it wasnt for walkens performance and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig the prophecy ii surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales jennifer beals from getting born for you see her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriels evil dominion thus just as in the first movie he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown the prophecy ii is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you dont make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity whenever the storyline becomes too tedious the makers luckily enough always insert a nearbrilliant christopher walken moment to distract you his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences on a slightly offtopic note i often felt like the prophecy ii ambitions to look similar to terminator ii Â… gabriels resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location where the final battle takes place looks very similar to the steel factory where terminator ii ended as well coincidence i guess overall this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case youre a fan of christopher walkens unique acting charisma and who isnt
