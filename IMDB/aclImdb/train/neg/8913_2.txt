when i first tuned in on this morning news i thought wow finally some entertainment it was slightly amusing for a week or so but we have to face it these news reporters if one can even call them that have way too much playing around timebr br at first i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air but seriously this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her she is very unprofessional she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report its just really become annoying to the point that i cant watch it anymorebr br jillian is not a good journalist hell shes more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity hence she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom shes supposed to be interviewing shes not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist and thats all i can say about herbr br also disappointingly this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world the government the us or something that will benefit andor serve the publics best interest theyre too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product on the other hand their field reporters are interestingly tolerablebr br i believe good day la is for young teenagers and celebrities and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the newsbr br side note id really rather watch ktla however they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes theyre still a bit dull though oh well ill stick to nbcs today abcs good morning america is also okay as long as diane sawyer doesnt become way too serious
