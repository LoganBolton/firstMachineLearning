i had to stop watching this film a pseudointellectual product for pretentious film viewers twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns not to mention that i was soon near tears over the 399 i had wasted at blockbuster joanna paculas acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting ones teeth i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents while were on the topic of talent breuers supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe she clearly has not learned her craft in fact shes really quite awful all the public scenes looked staged with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on dont rent this terrible movie you will be sorry you spent your money
