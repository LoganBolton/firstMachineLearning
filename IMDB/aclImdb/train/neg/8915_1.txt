my comments on this movie have been deleted twice which i find pretty offending since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people please be tolerant of other peoples opinion obviously writing in the spirit of nietzsches works is not understood so ill change my comment completelybr br i think this is a really bad movie for several reasonsbr br subject one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions one thing philosophers do agree on is that nietzsche was a great thinker so making a movie about his life which obviously includes his ideas is a thing one should be extremely careful with or preferably dont do at all wisdom starts with knowing what you dont know one might think this is not a review of the movie itself but the movie is not about an imaginary character it is about the life of someone who actually lived and hadhas great influence on the world of yesterday today and tomorrow if someone tells a story about a tomato i can express my thoughts about the story itself but also about the chosen subject the tomato there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not takenbr br screenplay one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents why it distracts from what it should be about nietzsche and the truths he found it doesnt help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time come on make it proper english or better yet german even mel gibson got that part right letting his characters speak some gibberish aramaic in the passionbr br secondly it is well overactedbr br 3d assante is not an actor to depict nietzsche bad castingbr br 4th facts are way offbr br and so on its a waste of celluloid
