having loved paris je taime i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasonsbr br although i was not expecting a remake of paris in new york i was expecting the same structure what i liked about paris was the breakup of the neighborhoods you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell in ny there is no clear separation of the stories at different points in the film characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flowbr br another thing i loved about the paris film was the different takes on love it wasnt all romantic there was love between parents and their children unrequited love a lonely middleaged woman yearning for love etc it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans ny seemed to only go for an edgy overthetop sexuality there were some redeemable shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together julie christies short but overall theny film didnt evoke any emotion for me i didnt connect with any of the characters like i did with paris i remember watching paris and feeling a deep sadness loneliness yearning hopefulness wonder it just had so much soul for me there was no soul in the ny filmbr br maybe if i had gone into it without having paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response but as a selftitled retake of paris je taime i was sorely disappointed
