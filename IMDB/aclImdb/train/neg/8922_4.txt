two old men sitting on a park bench  i dont really have a problem with this scene  only problem is that its not a scene its the entire moviebr br yup movies dont get anymore low concept than this  they also dont get anymore boring than this either  but theres worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese  one is nat moyer who is yiddish communist while the other is midge carter a former golden gloves champion whos also black  let me see now  a jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine  well i guess its possible though unlikely  but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype  why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths  slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930sbr br stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with im not rappaport is that its written for an entirely different meduim than cinema  its based on a stage play and it shows  walter matthau sleepwalks through his role as nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
