it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years for me the main problems the uneven scriptbr br while some of it is witty and hip quite a bit of it is dull unfunny and lifeless many of the gags just sit there lacking spark and energybr br of the cast mae west and rachel welch come over well roger herren in the role of rusty shines too bad he didnt make more films but for my money theres just too much of john huston and poor rex reed isnt hardly given a fighting chance his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines wondering what hes doing in this filmbr br the low user rating should give an idea as to the publics opinion of this piece vidals original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted not even the classic film clips did much all in all a rather sub par effort and its not likely to get much better with time
