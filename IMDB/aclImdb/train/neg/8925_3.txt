i never much liked the myra movie tho i appreciate how it pushed the hollywood envelope at the time certainly miss welchs costume became an iconic image though i have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about br br i rewatched myra on fmc a couple of years ago and didnt think it had aged any better thru the years theres a segment about it in the sexploitation cinema cartoon history comic books where its given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production however imho the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turnon and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage or entertain
