ill indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin my dissatisfaction is split 30 tonedeafness 70 lackluster writingbr br the 30 i agree with the first commenters synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories i was surprised how this film at best woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if its inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl a few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by obligation while we can see the gears under the film so clearly striving to be diverse but falling eversoshortbr br the 70 is why everything falls short all characters white plus a few token minorities are onedimensional cardboard cutouts of people concepts worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what id say is a gag we get a basic conceit then some punchline intended to be a clever twist but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say okay that was a surprisethe stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending youre writing jokesbr br spoilers belowbr br the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories thats fine but romance is amazing deep sometimes complex these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other words exchange thoughts are projected through voiceover but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to anotherbr br meaning there is no seduction in the broad sense no tension and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ethan hawke gets outwitted by the girl hes hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as wed be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b so it unfolds if something like a postcard could unfold with all the other tales as well a then bthats it the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan by the way the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west villagebr br its easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual orientation and so on new york i love you however deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title we expect to see the real new york and real new yorkers but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic its characters flown in from the oc plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity but when we look closer at who those characters are the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to representbr br for example the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact hes the father notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramaticconstruction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriendstepfather are strutting the girl away it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girls father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer what the dad cant be just some guy from south america now that hes obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middletoupperclass white woman are we that naive as to require such as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatablebr br its not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone but in every conceivable setup and plot twist the direction taken screams status quo appeals to safety all these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the singledimensionality of the characters inhabiting them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy how bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead again im not saying the entire conceit has to be changed its just that every damn story premise is so hackneyedand thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york outside the trite the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth readingbr br i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was well dredge and the general feel of many of the scenes the movie was just fine to sit through and i wouldnt dissuade anyone from doing so however it is telling that the most significant homage paid to nonsuperficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased thats what i love about new york everyones from a different place well you wouldnt know it from watching this one
