watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment its the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believedbr br im sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie oops thats not what happenedbr br the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released when it was finally released there wasnt the usual three ring circus of publicity if i remember correctly in houston it opened at driveins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venuesbr br i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne who was hot after having directed the not all that good joanna a film with music about young people in swinging mod londonbr br if i recall correctly fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could thats why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish an impressive supporting cast kathleen freeman jim backus john carradine andy devine and others is wasted with nothing to dobr br to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda in amazing footage from the gangs all here andlaurel and hardy who never dreamed theyd be playing in an x rated moviebr br the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions however none of the characters seem to be having any fun maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasnt bad to exploit thembr br this was one of the youth pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the 1970s one writer joked that easy rider which was made for pocket change was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success sixtyish once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never as best i know been out on home video or cable theyre the studios deep dark secretbr br raquel welchs performance in this is all things considered very good with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in she looks great and has awesome costumes mae west is the liveliest seventysomething actress ive ever seen on the one hand its kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by but im sure she needed the moneybr br if you want to see a big budget xrated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls also from fox because it doesnt take itself seriously its crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio myra breckinridge tries to say something there just wasnt anyone who wanted to listen
