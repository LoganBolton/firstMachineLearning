myra breckinridge is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent even from the people involved in making it this film was loathed from day one while every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do its not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like scarface or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like showgirls br br undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable myra breckinridge is just plain mean as a hollywood satire it is coldblooded and meanspirited but in a hollow pointless way myra takes for granted that hollywood is a corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as laurel and hardy shirley temple judy garland and gary cooper the film seems to imply that everything about hollywood is by its very nature vile it seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows but doesnt supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place the film is also viscously antiamerican and antiestablishment and antithis and antithat but all in a superficial late1960s trendy way like casino royale skidoo i love you alice b toklas and other wouldbe hip epics myra is a middleaged vision of the hippydippy youth culture it tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles but instead of being cheerfully selfmocking myra makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp myra breckinridge has the humor of a bully theres not a single moment of innocence in it its intentions arent honorable time magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as a child molester but its not nearly as sympatheticbr br for instance poor mae west bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse the octogenarian star obviously didnt know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her greatgrandsons but director michael sarne had to know but he used her anyway why because she apparently was the joke just like john huston john carradine grady sutton andy devine and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images they are cast as smarmy selfparodies as is rex reed the arrogant fey film critic who is cast as just that in the film but the real reed the celebrity hound jetsetting talk show gossip can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way but as myron myras alter ego he is just obnoxious again apparently for sarne reed is the jokebr br you watch myra breckinridge and you dont see actors you see victims none more so than raquel welch no one will ever accuse welch of being a great actress but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered being in almost every scene welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives a remarkably nuanced performance though of course centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost catatonic west welch doesnt have to do much to strike a good balance even so she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk with just the hint of selfrighteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud legend has it that welch was snubbed by a condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performancebr br the films only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the films agenda is the whole story is a fantasy fable which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver but what that might be is anybodys guess with all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind but as a feminist myra is a monstrous figure a sexual predator besides myra isnt a woman rather she is a delusion of myron who presumably is a gay male that might explain the male rape scene as well as the characters lovehate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight deadhead rusty but it doesnt explain hisher obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with farrah fawcetts mary ann the film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and degrading turning to gore vidals original novel isnt of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the moviebr br and this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies not just movies as a business but movies as part of the culture as well the film itself is walltowall arcane references to old movies all of which directorscreenwriter sarne approaches with a seething disdain he has raided the film vaults of 20th centuryfox and peppered the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide a social commentary but to mock the innocence of old hollywood how can an artist  if you generously want to call sarne that  make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in the very effort is totally selfdefeatingbr br myra breckinridge doesnt seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty it hates hollywood it hates america it hates sex it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and well you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it in a very sad and sorry way myra breckinridge may be the first punk manifesto a celebration of pop culture nihilism
