i still cant believe how bad this movie was if i wasnt a massochist i dont know if i would have survived the viewing it looks like it cost about 1000 to make but it wasnt the money that brought them down the acting was horrid  not just bad 3rd graders could have read the lines better second the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin and that is sorely lacking in this flick we dont even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff br br ahh well better luck next time eh
