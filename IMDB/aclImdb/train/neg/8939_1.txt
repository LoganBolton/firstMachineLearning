yeah i saw the rough cuts the unedited sex scenes the dire cut scenes almost on a par with the film the need for awful acting this movie is as bad as bad films getthe bad script bad acting bad effects bad locations bad stunts bad everything the best actors in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extrasbr br sean harry the foppish actor as someone else put it makes a matchstick look talented here his amazing ability to badly drive a car when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet check out the reflection in the windscreen his inability to turn left which is class oh and dont forget the sex scene plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldnt even be bothered to disguise as a real gun the other actors on screen could barely deliver their linesit was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasnt therebr br the special effects were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the creditsbr br if you want a laugh at a party then rent this moviethen again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and dont give money to people who dont deserve it
