when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards lets give it a chance i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first its not a comedy its a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that its even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another direction the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80s the acting should have been better too well to sum up its not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad production i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than ive ever imagined just forget about it
