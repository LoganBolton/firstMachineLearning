ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan 9 from outerspace donst stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece hes from england and thoroughly sarcasticbr br it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly donebr br watch it for the script though
