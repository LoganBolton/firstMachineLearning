i bought a set of 4 dvds for 10 bucks at my local suncoast which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel witchcraft xi so basically i paid the rock bottom price of 250 for this movie if you do the math i cant exactly say i was ripped off i have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name the budget couldnt be over 1000 though it appears as if they spent a total of 150 i know its a lowbudget film but thats no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork the film blood cult though not very good was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting the acting in this movie is the definition of effortless especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page you can take that figuratively or literally i wouldnt be surprised if the script was offcamera as they were performing i said before that ive never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones and though english movies arent always good they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication which is why i dont see why any englishman or englishwoman would volunteer to do a homevideostyle schlock flick like this did merchant ivory put a hold on their casting calls usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing acting and cinematography departments even when you watch a movie like glitter you cant honestly say it looks like a thirdgrader shot those scenes though a thirdgrader couldve written the script ive seen home movies that are shot better than witchcraft x and thats no exaggeration whatsoever even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city not a single effort was put into making this movielets just sum it up like that you get the picture theres a good deal of nudity though that doesnt save it however i must say that girl with the redorange hair whos either naked or wearing a cleavagepopping outfit throughout the film is really hot br br my score 1 out of 10
