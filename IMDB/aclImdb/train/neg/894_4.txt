just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival just before going i came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was 74 a pretty nice ratebr br after 15 minutes i was dying to get out never did this but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screeningbr br i did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are shallower than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile poppingup all the time on her laptop or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen all of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad a dont know how to do sexinthecitybr br dont waste your time or money
