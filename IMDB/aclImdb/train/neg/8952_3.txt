after hearing about george orwells prophetic masterpiece for all of my life im now 37 but never having read the book i am totally confused as to what ive just seenbr br i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as im sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it im still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched itbr br on the plus sidebr br the cinematography is amazing hurt  burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film makingbr br now for the down sides and there are plentybr br there is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why  with who nothing is explained there are a couple of names bandied about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanationbr br who is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isnt he on the front line why doesnt he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink hes drinking through the entire film why is he so weak  ill why isnt he brainwashed like the rest of them whats the deal with his mother  sister what happened to his father a little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that havent read the book without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow arthouse movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going onbr br the soundtrack was disjointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but its very annoying all the samebr br also i know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coveragebr br i personally cant abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that ive seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it isbr br theres no denying that it was light years ahead of its time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many scifi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storylinebr br i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if im to make any sense out of thisbr br all in all very disappointed in something ive waited for years to watch
