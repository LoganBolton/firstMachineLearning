as far as the movie goes its an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said its not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetchedbr br as for calling this another cubemovie is utter and complete bullsht this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of peopleandroids as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretchbr br i gave this a 3 because of the backstabbing of the original this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them allbr br watchable for those who have not seen cube  hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series
