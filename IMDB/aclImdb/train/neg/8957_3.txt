incredible does it get any dumber than this not a chance the stupidity in this movie would shame even ed wood de palma and woo if the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog then this one has cretinous dialog amazing but this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog too in spite of the acting and the dialog i liked the first two films but cube zero will surely kill the franchise the utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated leftwingerbr br i sometimes wonder if such leftists even themselves realize just how antidemocracy and prodictatorship they are in this movie they obviously target the us Â– a democracy why dont they target korea iran syria china zimbabwe etc in antimilitary movies sure most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon but thats beside the point its obvious writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes whether they are aware of it or not i would even go as far as to say that anyone who adamantly attacks us foreign policies all the time has antidemocratic beliefs in his corebr br back to the movie apart from being so farfetched that it isnt even funny any more the film has many obvious illogicalities for example for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy or how about that cretinous character the oneeyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if hes in a bad mel brooks comedy in fact as soon as this creature appears the movie loses all seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting it really does become a comedy
