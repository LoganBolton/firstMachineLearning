the only thing that frequently pops into my head while im writing this review isill never get that hour and a half back to indicate that im not just blowing air ill compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogycube and hypercubecube wasnt great but it was original and that made up for some technical flawshypercube as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it beter than cubethe story was better but cube zero in comparison to its predecessors really isnt worth shta complete lack of good fx a very fckd up script and just plain old bad acting dont combine well exampleall of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if  should happen and then it would happen so its not very original neither my advice dont lose that hour and a half i lost oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns
