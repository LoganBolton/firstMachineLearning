i think this one sucked on ice because it left the cube and gave us to much information as to the whos and whys the original cube never left the cube and it left everything to your imagination this crap fest however gives you it all and i didnt like itthough the acting is solid i think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers if they had vincenzo natali do this prequel or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source so i recommend you stay far far away from this one and hypercube another movie i dont even want to discussi gave it a 2 for the acting only
