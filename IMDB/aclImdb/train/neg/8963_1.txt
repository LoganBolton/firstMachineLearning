the killings in this movie isnt that bad but for sure the movie is its even worse than that its not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvdplayerbr br not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvdstore not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it horriblebr br its beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching add to that the group pressure from my cowatchersbr br the manuscript is awful the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicablebr br i hope you dont see this as a spoiling your fun id rather see it as a fair warning do not waste your time watching this garbage
