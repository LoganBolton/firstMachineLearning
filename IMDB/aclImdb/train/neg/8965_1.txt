this is pretty much a lowbudget made for tv type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original im a fan of bmovies and this one might have been good had they not attached the name cube to it because as is the director and plot of the original were better and this movie just about ruined my taste for the entire series the characters are annoying and clich√©d there are problems with continuity and several outright production screwups the story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that they more or less use the same horror gimmicks over and over throughout the movie and because the first one was so good this simply turns out as a disappointmentbr br if this was a standalone bmovie id probably give it about a four the 1 rating i give it was pretty much a statement about how it utterly paled in effects and intelligence as compared to the first
