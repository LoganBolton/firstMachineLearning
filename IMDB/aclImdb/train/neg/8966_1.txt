the original cube is a fantastic bmovie rich with paranoia meaty characterization and fine overthetop performances its creepy cryptic and cool and it stands perfectly well on its own without a stupid sequel like cube zero br br this third  film in the cube series is part retread most of the booby traps are sadly recycled part aberration it takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is  something that was never revealed in the first movie  but since said explanation is bland id rather it was kept a secret there are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of politicalreligious totalitarian state so what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocusedbr br what works basically nothing the acting is purely amateur hour the pacing is slow how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen and the gore effects while revolting fail to convince in short cube zero reminded me of a cube fanfic a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel
