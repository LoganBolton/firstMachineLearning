the screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life ill never get back where have i heard this before the acting is soso things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen nevertheless there isnt a single original thing in this movie while the first cube was a nerdy horror movie which didnt make a whole lot of sense in the end cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoonfeed explanations for every detail that the first movie didnt answer the comic thing is the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird and tries to explain them but the scenes are just copied over there is no coherence whatsoever this script is sooo pointless i can imagine it being written by some halfwit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project the best part is in the end they cripple the good wunderkind guy and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie and you see him when they find him this room is green in cube 1997 goodie gooodie clap clap what a twist first of all what about if you havent seen the first one this doesnt make any sense you nitwit director oh another great idea instead of the numbers to identify xyz coordinates of the room cube 1997 this time it is 3 letters each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values duh except now permutations dont make much sense anymoreso he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use themi want my money backbr br i guess i had to write this down since there are just so many bad inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie directorswriters should be required to possess some talent
