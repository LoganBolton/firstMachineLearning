this film is awful not offensive but extremely predictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid60s the father the principal at the school is going through a midlife crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students minds with some thoughtprovoking stuff like think for yourself the principal doesnt agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the dots his teenage daughter winona ryder wannabe tara frederick is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some bad advice hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasnt being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv this movie plays like a more adult version of an afterschool special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms
