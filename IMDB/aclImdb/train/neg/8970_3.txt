the first cube movie was an art movie it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldnt understand it was on the nonliteral level a man vs cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond mans petty squabbles a world where there were no more struggle but peace i rated cube a 10 out of 10 and its a movie that was never meant to have any sequelsbr br the second movie hypercube was a massive disappointment some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning still for being fairly entertaining i rated it a 5 out of 10br br the third movie cube zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial bmovie rehash of the first sans the symbolism there is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off the same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes  an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a ripoff with absolutely no originality and nothing to saybr br that we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of and in this movie those who get through to the exit like kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed  where the bleep is the sense in that thats just flippin stupid im glad i didnt pay to see thisbr br the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10
