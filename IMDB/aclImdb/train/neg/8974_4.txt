this movie i wont call it a film was basically about nothing and functioned mostly for the popular acts of the time yeah the war was on full swing pun intended and this movie gave the troops and our audiences a treatbr br but lets have something with a bit more substancebr br loved seeing a young buddy rich on the drums the music was good throughoutbr br but one cameo after another gets old fastbr br i didnt even recognize zero mostel so if youre one from the greatest generation as they say youll definitely enjoy thisbr br movie
