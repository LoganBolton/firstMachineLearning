if youve ever wanted to see a film that stresses style over substance this is for you to me son de mar is beautiful to see but theres precious little substance unless mawkish melodramatic manipulative love yarns turn you on this may be one of those famous chick flicks youve heard so much about br br were about halfway through this film before anything really happens ulises jordi molla goes out to sea looking for tuna and doesnt come back leaving his wife martina leonor watling and son to fend for themselves then in a furious six minutes of screen time they bury ulises martina gets married again and her son grows into midchildhood this rapid transposition is jarring to say the least and very sloppy after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around were suddenly into a fullblown melodrama all in six minutes i think this is called wayward narrative pacingbr br five years later ulises as in the wandering superhero ulysses get it returns to his penelope watling only to find shes married to sierra eduard fernandez an inexplicably wealthy guy what does he do to earn all that dough who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets when martina in great anger questions ulises about his absence he tells her that hell take her to the island of sumatra someday and shell understand everythingbr br and heres the thing he doesnt take her to the island of sumatra the reference just dies somewhere in the script he doesnt really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years he doesnt acquit himself as an honourable guy and the movie doesnt fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film i can only assume that director bigas luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues fish reptiles the sea he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue it just doesnt work the narrative arc on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clotheslinebr br im sure jordi molla is a good actor but i just couldnt buy his ulises as any kind of hero which is what the original ulysses was supposed to be with moist sensuality he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from virgil roughly 2000 times and each and every time it excites martina to explosive orgasm this guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages im sure virgil would be impressed he didnt get laid that often as i understand it br br this poetic device figures prominently in the film and i had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of ulysses famous siren song ie beautiful maidens singing seductively to faroff sailors who were doomed if they answered the well siren call if this is what bigas luna is up to you can see the problem  hes offering convoluted symbolism in a snatchandgrab attempt at high art once again it just doesnt work at least in my eyesbr br watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor but she gives us a character here who doesnt seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth its beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a forrent sign on his face as in vacant oily 1960sstyle hair that looks more like seaweed and one of those trendy 21stcentury beards you know four days growth no more no less hes supposed to be a dreamy kind of guy i think but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script br br but dont despair this film is great to look at just dont try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what youre hearing in the way of dialogue you can do a lost of fastforwarding on this film particularly in the first 40 minutes and you really wont miss much
