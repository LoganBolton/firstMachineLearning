previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm but it was a severe disappointment lupe valdez is great but doesnt get enough screen time frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters but the script leaves them strandedbr br the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracys character who is at best a selfcentered physically and verbally abusive jerk the reactions of the public are poorly thoughtout and unbelievable making the shenanigans seem like contrivances of a bad writer and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for himbr br the stinging oneliners mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer since i didnt even notice that an attempt was being made
