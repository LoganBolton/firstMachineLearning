the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storylineotherwise this movie was terrible the acting was ridiculously bad and the set design was cheesy and very tacky the story was decent but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting i wouldnt recommend watching this onethe only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractiveespecially ryan bauer the man who plays the soap opera star some of the editing was well done but there are continuity errors all over the placeim just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are badcan we get a good one soon
