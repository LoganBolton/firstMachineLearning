until now the worst movie i had ever seen was ben  arthur you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one the review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online at least the people who made ben  arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy itbr br everything about this movie is terrible the script the story the casting the acting the direction the photography the editing the music what else goes into a movie whatever it is here its as bad as it gets if it werent so unpleasant it would be ridiculous i kept watching it thinking it must get better because i hadnt yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliablebr br it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad my favorite example of a shoestringbudget masterpiece is gus van sants amazing mala noche but there are many others sideline secretsdirectors cut or originalis bad not because the people who made it had no money but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except selfpromotion
