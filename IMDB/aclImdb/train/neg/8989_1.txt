there are some good things about the movie the music and cinematography is great alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance ryan bauer is also hot the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie jonny vincent sean and a lot of the boys in the movie that dont speak are cute too why isnt the actress who plays amy listed in the credits brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as clitarissa pinkbr br the worse thing about the movie is probably the star james townsend he cant act hes also very scrawny not nice to look at at all his arms are like spaghetti its disgusting they have no muscle tone at all its no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it no one else would cast him in anythingbr br james townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted whats best for the movie then again maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in softcore porn definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons plus anyone who does porn is blacklisted in hollywoodbr br the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tanskinned latina as devons mother sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all all in all this movie is softcore porn and is no better than something you would see on skinemax i think even alex wilson probably the best thing about this movie is embarrassed by it and doesnt want to be associated with it there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name plus i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie he just turned around and walked away i understand if i had worked on this movie i would be embarrassed and wouldnt want to be associated with it either
