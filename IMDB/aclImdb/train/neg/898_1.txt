eddie murphys delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of standup eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokesbr br forget it unless you happen to enjoy eddies foul style i dont think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie scriptbr br saturday january 17 1998  video
