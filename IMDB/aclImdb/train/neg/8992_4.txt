this is a decent endeavor but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool no it isnt cgi bugs and software companies actually im not sure whether it was a software company  i saw it without subtitles so i had to guess what theyre talking about anyway my point was  instead of wasting your time animating some dumbass bug why not throw in more zombies and more action 23 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins bugs some guys yelling about something and to makes matters worse more boring most of the deaths occur offscreen i realize thats all too common for nobudget movies but then there were some very impressive effects well kinda of which left me wondering why did the director or screenwriter whatever chose to focus on how the epidemic started  its a short nobodys gonna care anyway
