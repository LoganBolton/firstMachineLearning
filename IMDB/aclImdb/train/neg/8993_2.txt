back in the 70s when i had first seen this i was in high school it was cool then now as an adult i look back at it and i say to myselfyeah right what was so funny it has its moments but they are few and far between it is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost if you like this type of humor you may want to stick with kentucky fried movie or amazon women from the moon tunnel vision as well as groove tube are too dated for todays viewing
