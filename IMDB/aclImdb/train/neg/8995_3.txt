i missed the beginning but i did see most of it a friend got it on dvd in the cheap room at fyebr br the skits are all very short and yet most of them are still too long the majority of them they seem to have forgotten to have something funny quite a lot of racistsexisthomophobic humor in it skits based on stereotypes or skits which use racist terms for peoplebr br im trying to remember anything i thought was funny in it and im having trouble the logo for the tunnel vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it the mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids kind of creepybr br what a disappointment most of the actors went on to better things and its lucky this bomb didnt hold them back
