ok i just have 3 words  cheesy cheesy and cheesy the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain other than that  its cheeseball supremebr br the movie does have some promise in the concept  an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon  basically giving us more of jurassic park meets reign of fire there are some great possibilities but they just dont follow through the special effects are decent  even though you know the dragon is cgi it doesnt horribly look like cgi br br i wouldnt lay the blame on dean cain although he is one of the producers id lay more of the blame on phillip roth  the director and writer its his job to make this film and unfortunately he failed
