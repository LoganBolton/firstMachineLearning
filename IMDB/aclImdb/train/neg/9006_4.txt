br br once i ignored some of the implausibilities this was actually a fairly decent horrormonster flick so ill give some of the good points first  the dragon was quite convincing especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch hint she likes humans  the action was fairly non stop and after a weak beginning i got quite absorbed in the storyline  sorry to say i was kind of rooting for the dragon  she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the moviebr br now for the implausible stuff maybe some spoilers  if you were hunting a firebreathing dragon in 1100 ad would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm duh  a female character with an allamerican name blonde hair and obvious slavic accent trying to pretend shes spanish huh  a lead scientist whose slavic accent you can cut with a knife and hes supposedly born in chicago educated in usa  a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs flies a huge transport copter with no other crew and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot ok uh huh i wont even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his basebr br its still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the 60s but not by much if were lucky we wont see dragon fighter 2 though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open or maybe theyll hire a real director next timebr br in spite of everything i gave this flick a 4 out of 10 add 2 more if they rewrite the plot and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes grin
