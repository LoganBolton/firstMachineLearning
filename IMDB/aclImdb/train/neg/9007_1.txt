this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen i literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie the cgi was awful and the story was just a waste of ink dean cains character was mrsuperintuitiveicanfigureoutanything except he cant seem to work his own helicopter correctly the biggest problem was the split screen camera work i felt like i was watching the brady bunch or something only it wasnt different people in the boxes just close ups and different views of the same thing i can only figure that the actors really needed the money because this movie wasnt worth the film it was shot on
