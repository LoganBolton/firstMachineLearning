when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member you know youre in for a bad ridebr br i went in with very very low expectations having read some of the other comments and was not let down unlike some other cheap and failed movies however this one doesnt really remain hilariously and unintentionally funny throughoutbr br spoilers followbr br first of all plot it very inconsistent looking past the small mistakes such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours the whole idea its based on is messed up see the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs after explaining this they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out later the obligatory crazy scientist guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were or we just have a fine little plot hole here the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force half as strong as what was used for hiroshima then two guys later walk in to check everything out and its almost unscathed theres even another dragon which grew out of who knows what all in all its very predictable as soon as the guy mentioned cloning i guessed theyd clone a dragon that means that our mr smartypants security guy isnt so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe if you ignore that i knew this film would be about you know dragonsbr br putting that aside the second worst thing is the special effects others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning the cg helicopter and the dragon it looks a bit better than a blob but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time to their credit the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie these things are funny to watch however the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not nor are the introduction screens with the vital statsbr br coming to the actors they werent the greatest but i guess at least they tried they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent bloodrayne for example and youve got to give them points for that one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in makeup that was many tones lighter than the rest of her she looked like she had a bad runin with some whitefacebr br the script is bad and cheesy you dont really notice the music but its actually not too bad for the most partbr br the bottom line is dont watch it unless you want to see it because you hear its bad like i did although the only funny things are the bad cg effects other than that dont waste your time and money
