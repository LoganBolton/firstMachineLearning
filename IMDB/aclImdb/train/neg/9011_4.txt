pretty standard bmovie stuff seriously anyone who watches dragon fighter with dean cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence b movies exist to rework formulas that are popular if you give them even token analysis youll wind up ruining the movie for yourself and perhaps writing some selfimportant slanderous review on imdbbr br i liked the female lead kristine byers she had charisma and i thought she was notably attractive it was a memorable bmovie appearance unfortunately i dont see where she has made any movies since ill watch for her again
