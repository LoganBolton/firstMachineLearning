yesterday i saw the movie flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie shes ever seen since i thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking  which film was the worst film i had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mindbr br unfortunately it was a couple of years since ive seen it but i remember the horribly miscast dean cain as cocky military man pretty boy cain doesnt do cocky very well the strange deal with the cgihelicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some cgiguys to make it but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some cgi program or the producers son liked to play with his new computer and how did it look awful and when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over  looks very cheapbr br avoid this movie  it is truly awful
