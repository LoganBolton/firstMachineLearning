its hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tediousbr br i was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an exemperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinkerbr br the story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friends house and get drunk while doing so  then itll be enjoyable
