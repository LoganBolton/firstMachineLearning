i caught this movie on scifi before heading into work if youve any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times this movie is for you if that doesnt peak your interest well im afraid youll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames because this movie is pretty bad the acting to begin with is awful awful awful the characters are all completely obnoxious and the dialogue is worse than your typical zgrade scifi movie towards the end the movie began to remind me of hollow man complete with escape via elevator shaft except with a dragon not a naked invisible man unlike other similar flicks however this one wasnt even awesomely badit was just plain bad
