this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff youve seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it isnt something youre likely to remember a while it is best seen while youre cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly isnt something you sit down with friends to watch unless youre all just drunk and dont care the mass rating of 32 is probably fair i dont think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film
