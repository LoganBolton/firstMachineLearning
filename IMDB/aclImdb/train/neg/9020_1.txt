i mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie no proper character development wait im not even sure they were characters setups were hokey and inane and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldnt even synchronize with alternate shots if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would sadly it isnt even worth the time for a few laughsbr br  its just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood and now i waste my time even thinking about it
