i have watched anime but im not a die hard fan and i dont read manga i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background i have seen st johns wort and although it isnt a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination it made me pick up shinobi especially since everyone seems to love itbr br well i watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching yes its very beautiful  the slow motion water scenes the autumn leaves on the trees even the cgi eye flicker  majestic i liked the hawk the costumes even some of the fight scenes but overall this was dull as dirtbr br it seemed as if someone took romeo and juliet  the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers  and threw in some xmen for good measure two of the characters split wolverines powers  the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the greyhaired guy had his ability to heal himself then you have the girl who has a poison kiss  thats poison ivy from batman why do they give these women such dumb powers poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death man thats some great power for you and the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands the other woman one of the star crossed lovers has the power of a hypnotic stare wowbr br i sort of made it to the end of the film by fast forwarding it and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected some people are comparing this to house of flying daggers and hero dont make that mistake they may share similar endings but thats where the similarities end shinobi is made by an amateur  the other films are made by an experienced filmmakerbr br i would say avoid this film unless youre 12 to 18 years old
