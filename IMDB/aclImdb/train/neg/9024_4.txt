shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom diebr br ok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbbr br fine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it
