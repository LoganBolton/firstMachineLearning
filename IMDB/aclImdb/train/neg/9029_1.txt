this movie wastes virtually every actors talents in what could best be charitably called a potboilerbr br despite its actionpacked top gun opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcornbr br there are so many deadend story lines in this movie i was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded tv seriesbr br quinns mexican druglord role is laughable and his associates plucked right out of a 1970s quinnmartin cop show costners character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with mendez wife nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming alongbr br definitely a b movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved
