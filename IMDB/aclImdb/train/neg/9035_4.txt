being born in the 1960s i grew up watching the tv movies of the week in the early 70s and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including crowhaven farm bad ronald satans school for girls kolchak the night stalker etc but this one is just plain dumbthis is obviously the writers trying to capitalize on the horrific manson murders from a few years earlier the movie stars dennis weaver of mccloud and duel fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach the family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family the reason for this is never explained and weavers pacifistic stance is hard to swallow for gods sake call the police beat the hell of them or something just dont sit there and whine about it the acting is pretty lame the story unbelievable etc susan dey looks cute in a bikini but thats about it ignore this if it ever airs on tv
