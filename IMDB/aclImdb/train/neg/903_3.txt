1937s stella dallas with barbara stanwyck hasnt exactly aged wellhow anyone thought a semiupdated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler perhaps they thought jaunty cheerfully brash bette midler could make something out of it but this hoary script defeats her plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock and years later giving the young girl over to the childs wealthy father so shell have a shot at a better life cant escape tatty oldfashioned trappings and sentiment midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses but that fails to happen here stephen collins is stolid as the man who changes her life but trini alvarado is wellcast as midlers daughter this is what used to be referred to as a womans picture a wallow but it doesnt pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930s origins 12 from
