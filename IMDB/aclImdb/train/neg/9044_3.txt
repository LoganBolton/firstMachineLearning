i really wanted to like this film but so much of it is stolenborrowed from other work  some of the borrowing is painfully blatant the new york times review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers cartoon hello my baby hello my darlin hello my ragtime gal but i challenge anyone to watch the foxblue sky animated feature robots 2005 and not find ridiculous similarities in storyline  a young inventor growing up and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventionsbr br cityscape  extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environmentsbr br robots  the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots and both films use a sort of retrofuturistic lookbr br all of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicitybr br the filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction as though we dont have the attention span for anything lessbr br the villain is really welldesigned and brilliantly animated and hes a pleasure to watch much of the rest of the film seems throwntogether some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid90sbr br the film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short by the end of this cartoon we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling  they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue
