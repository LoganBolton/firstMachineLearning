now for the truth its very very weak storyline  for a walt disney film its total rubbish when the robinson appear the films all over the place i was shocked how poor it was it like alice in wonderland gone wrong it feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it  and they dont after that i sat there wishing for the end my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story the characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you dont care about the ending you just want the film to finish its a film to forget and forget quickly if youve got some spare time dont waste it on this
