originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town they arent allowed phone calls and nobody knows theyre there what follows is rape torture beatings humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusionbr br the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down the unrated version is even worsetheres plentiful nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her yuck theres nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degradedall this is shoved in your face like youre supposed to enjoy it the needlessly downbeat ending doesnt helpbr br im giving it a 3 because the acting is goodbut that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick sleazy film not recommended
