i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldnt wait to see it what a waste of energy its kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for completionists who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive it lacks the power of lynchs later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work its tedious and looks like a student film but it was the 70sits interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director but you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds the alpahabet is forgettable no really i cant remember this one at all the amputee is pointless the cowboy and the frenchman is just plain silly lumiere is the only worthwhile one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd
