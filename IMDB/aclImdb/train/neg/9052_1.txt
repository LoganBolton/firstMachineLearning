i respect the fact that this is a very popular show however in comparison with robert altmans ingenious hilarious zany and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic this show was probably destined to be lessthanmediocre even if it did run for 11 years that doesnt necessarily make it any good this show formed an alltoointegral part of my early childhood it was on reruns every night and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up but its one of the memories i dont miss and now that i actually have seen the movie i can give this series an accurate critique on its own its not nearly 2 out of 10 bad however the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie some of them technically are the same but theyre only similar in name for instance since when is alan alda anything like donald sutherland his style of humor is totally different as are his characterization and outlook the new characters are not that great they just serve to make you miss the ones that theyre replacing its the same with the new actors including jamie farr the only thing that actually transfers to the series is radar whos still even though played by the same actor merely a pale imitation of the original what else oh yeah with a laugh track it didnt matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not it comes across as creepy due to whats going on in the other settings and because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual korean war it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesnt work outside the world of cartoons ive never liked this show and i never will
