being a fan of billy bob thornton and the diversity of his skills i noticed this movie listed and was surprised i hadnt heard of itbr br id traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 212 years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the productionbr br now patrick swayze cant act for sour apples but thornton has more than enough ability to makeup for the difference between them and charlize theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint drybr br being curious i checked this sites production info it made a whopping  600 per screen its opening weekend and just over 400 each after its months theater run in latter 2002 overall gross was 261k which id doubt could cover cast and crews hotel and food for a week on locationbr br the story is pretty benign and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goingsonbr br its something like several snl bits all pieced together none individually too great at all and the overall presentation even worsebr br whatever the expenses for this production had to be considerable  even if all worked for less than their usual fees  so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and billy bobs present albeit understandably somewhat laconic here  compared with his usual workbr br think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in sling blade bandits and bad santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this one star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical lifetime flick
