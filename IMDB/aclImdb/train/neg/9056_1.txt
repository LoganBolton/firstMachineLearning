ive seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst definately bottom 100 material imo that isbr br we follow two couples the dodds billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene and the kirkendalls patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy in one car on a roadtrip to renobr br apparently lonnie isnt too happy with his sexlife so he cheats on his wife with candy whos despirately trying to have a baby roy meanwhile isnt too sure if his sperm is ok so hes getting it checked by a doctorbr br now i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend didnt and she blurted out after about 20 minutes oh yeah shes gonna end up pregnant but her husband cant have any babys spot on as this movie is soooo predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terriblebr br an example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada when they are stopped by 2 policeofficers as they didnt stop at a stopsign the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes its just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewherebr br i still have to puke thinking about the ending though apparently roy isnt having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after yuckbr br best scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why couldnt they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutesbr br one would expect more from this cast although thornton really tries but you cant really blame them writers shame on youbr br 110
