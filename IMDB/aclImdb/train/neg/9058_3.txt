when this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel theres nothing special here that you need to see story is about two married couples from arkansas who go on a trip together to reno couple number one is lonnie earl dodd billy bob thornton who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage his wife is darlene natasha richardson and she has a low self opinion of herself and they havent been intimate in a long time lonnie has been sleeping with candy charlize theron who is the wife of his best friend roy kirkendall patrick swayze they all drive to reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite roy and candy have been trying to have a baby and finally candy discovers that she is pregnant but roy phones his doctor in arkansas and finds out that hes sterile candy and lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos this film is directed by jordan brady and hes made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive unfortunately brady doesnt show much comedic flair but you cant lay all the blame on him this script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level just because theyre all from the south doesnt mean that they have to be naive and idiotic thorntons character doesnt have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar and swayzes character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day penelope cruz pops up as a prostitute and its a totally worthless and pointless cameo she barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines i think she was fulfilling an obligation to harvey and bob weinstein who are executive producers for this film the only person who actually isnt to bad is richardson we watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche all of these actors should know better and its hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it its a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid as for the viewers your not getting paid so skip this one
