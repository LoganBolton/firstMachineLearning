ill just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that its essentially prespoiledbr br this movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this youll say oh yeah that is a ripoffbr br i think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once youve identified a plot element is to figure out whether theyll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
