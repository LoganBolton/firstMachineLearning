channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because its so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious completely inane and the acting is throwupinyourmouth badbr br theres low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel im sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10x10 boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didnt learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scenewow a toilet  yaayyyyy  i dont buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells likeand it looks likewell you know the restbr br avoid like the plaguebr br edit apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence ie its refreshing to seebr br sure it may be refreshing to see but that doesnt equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly id rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again
