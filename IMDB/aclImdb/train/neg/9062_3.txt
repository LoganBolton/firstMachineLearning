this movie was different in that it didnt show the typical gay stereotypes that im used to seeing but that doesnt change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline im sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen since black gay characters are seldom seen and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed but how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning middle and end or how about a story that was focused there really doesnt seem to be a point to this film and even though it is a low budget film that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot
