about halfway through i realized i didnt care about these characters in the least however i watched a bit more anyway regrettably i came back the next day and finished it i shouldnt have botheredbr br if you know anything about the film beforehand you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor  and the title gives you a pretty good idea of whats gonna happen afterward  hes gonna get on the phone and call people about it that was almost as bad as snakes on a plane another bad aviation catastrophe flickbr br i realize this is an old film and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today but even by those standards the acting was embarrassing these werent characters they were stereotypes i suspect this movie was more than anything an attempt by bette davis to help her husbands gary merrill career to no avail however  i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he didbr br davis playing the happy cripple ie a nonglamorous role was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move it wasnt it was just boring she was a kind of tiny tim in the film making trask merrills character see the truth about love and forgiveness although she was less winsome than tiny tim calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just diedbr br the final scene where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile was so affected and overacted on both ends of the phone line i almost cringed i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this filmbr br i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie if you found it uplifting  thats great but frankly i just found it bad there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted
