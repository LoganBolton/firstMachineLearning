david h steinbergs script seemed initially having some real smart points that couldve made good romantic comedy but but but oh dear  what did ever happen in the way  br br ill tell you what happened originally its animal house  1978 and porkys  1982 although that was long time ago but those are the pioneers the godfathers of the new genre  the crude teen comedy then the 1990s came after important instances that became smash hits repulsive ones am i add such as problem child  1990 dumb and dumber  1994 the nutty professor  1996 and theres something about mary  1998 which i think slackers is affected by there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era the one and only  american pie  1999 whichs undoubtedly and incomparably a genres icon after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy cum laude nasty to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion br br i believe that slackers had a smart plot first as a script then its makers got to add some real big amount of  rudeness filthiness strangely shameless sex to be made  at those days  as easy as pie  like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as  masturbation oral sex urination etc just to look a la mode theyre wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the profits and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in itbr br some of its moments looked literally horrible and that as you see is the point its all in jason schwartzmans looks and performance memorably disgusting to the utmost so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what wasnt done before of pure skinning images to be more like a horror where youre asking all the time what nastier would happen  vomiting farting etc these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadaysbr br though even if you hated it youve got to love something mostly for being bold for me it was only gina gershon cameos scene anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outragesforoutrageousness like an adolescents naughty dream though the majority of it was near to anybodys nightmarebr br what made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work and not another cheap another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be remember well the details of stealing the exam the first 2 minutes so the movies main plot weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys through the pattern of boy loves girl and girl loves another boy because save that its nothing but a candidly schlock it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything would do it ended up as being and im sorry to say it a smiling sht br br at its end it said something can you imagine  about how its the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win totally like this comedy itself it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one once  and it doesnt need much to understand that this movies makers were the real slackers  maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood but even if the final result here wasnt at least witty by any sense of the word br br ps  its scriptwriter david h steinberg who wrote the story of american pie 2 as well has a main page at the imdb where youll find under the additional details his usual plot keywords which are  sex  vulgarity  crude humor  they just forgot to write urineing while showering or baring 70 year old women
