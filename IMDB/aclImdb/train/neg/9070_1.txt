slackers is just another teen movie thats not really worth watching dave devon sawa sam jason segel and jeff michael c maronna are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying cheating and scheming the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now during final exams these bigmenoncampus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school the plot is very stupid and theres no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but theres no real true funny or original moment in the movie its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny though for every joke that works theres at least eight more that dont the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy even if they do they probably wont remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you cant blame him too much the funniest character was probably laura prepon though shes not in the movie very much the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however that may be too long for some people who dont really like this type of humor slackers isnt the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average when compared to other films in the genre theres a lot better out there such as not another teen movie american pie and its sequels  scary movie 1  2 etc so unless you have seen most of them and youre looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else rating 4310 a below average teen comedy thats worth skipping
