this movie has no plot and no focus yes its supposed to be a slapstick stupid comedy but the screenwriters have no idea what the movie was about even the title doesnt go along with the movie it should have been called cool ethan or cheaters never win or something like that the characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them the girl roommate character from that 70s show was the only person worth watching she was hilarious and stole every scene she was in the others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since theyll need a career other than acting
