this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad the premise was ok but the plot itself was terrible the actors tried their best with limited material but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film jason schwartzman was once again immensely irritating  even more so than in rushmore the rest of the cast were quite noneventful scenes that should have been fun turned out to be offputting  incredibly juvenile tries to be a road tripamerican pie but fails dismally on all levels a total waste of everyones time
