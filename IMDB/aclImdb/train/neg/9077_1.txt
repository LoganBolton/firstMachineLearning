if you enjoy films like american pie road trip  van wilder avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs it is an unamusing meanspirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers easily the worst film i have seen in the past 18 months mindnumbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of its runtime had it been much longer i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity consider yourself warned
