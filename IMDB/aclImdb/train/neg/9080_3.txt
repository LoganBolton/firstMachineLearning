well i just ordered this on my payperview at home because i was bored and needed a laugh i have to admit i did chuckle a few times but i dont even remember what parts they were at i dont understand why this movie was made it claims to be a comedy but seriousuly i dont find a singing penis or a naked 70 year old woman very funny this movie was trying to fit itself into the grossout comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip but it just failed miserably it was way to much grossout then it was comedy also why on earth did cameron diaz attach her name to this movie the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and welldone besides that avoid this movie 310
