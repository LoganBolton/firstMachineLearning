i was aware of rohmers admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures as renoirs or chaplins very last movies  yes the politique des auteurs also has its dark side but with les amours dastrée et de céladon its as if rohmer himself wanted for what may be his last movie to perpetuate this tradition of great directors who made a last senile movie by adapting urfés lastrée with ridiculous aesthetic codes witch just look like a parody of rosselinis last movies the ones he made for tv from descartes or marxs livesbr br in his version of perceval rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a retranscription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved and films actors dressed like 1600s peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees its not that the story itself is stupid but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny and im not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly the ridiculous softerotic tone the poor musical tentatives or the strange fascination for trasvestismentbr br the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke which mixes a softerotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions sic  at the beginning of the movie rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity and thats why he had to film lastrée in other parts of the country however im sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions this film may interest a few historians but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmers movie
