its been said several times  not least by me  that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry it seems that monsieur rohmer resents this he doesnt deny it but then how could he he just resents it so much so that his new movie which may also be his last inch allah is set so far back in time that its like watching woad dry those wonderful people who gave you the nouvelle vague cahiers du cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea reality is not high on rohmers agenda so that in 5th century france we have at one extreme a château that would not be out of place in the loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut the story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for special needs pupils was captured on film by accident one is almost tempted to say come back godard all is forgiven but even this woeful production cant make me utter those words
