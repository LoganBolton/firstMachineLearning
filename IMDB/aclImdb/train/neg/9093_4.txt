ive seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before probably because of its poor message br br first of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the cgi im not a fan of cgi is magnificent but that alone doesnt make a movie no story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talentsbr br or do i have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story and this is whats missing the whole 7 minutesbr br there for a simple 4 rating
