i dont usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to i have spoken of taste in another review saying its all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film if you like it it simply means you have bad tastebr br i love films i loved isle of the dead which is pretty much an unknown bw film i even liked scream and scary movie i liked these films because they have if not a lot at least something good about them i appreciate 999 of the films ive seen because they tell a story which i havent heard before and most directors only make films with a good storyline throughout this film i was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be a joke and suchlike with the obvious twist looming i was sceptical but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove i hadnt wasted my time i was sadly mistaken the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was heres a rundown storyline  much like the first film which was alright this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable the twist was terrible it didnt make me feel a thing like excitement or wow just my god there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think oooo wasnt that clever because it wasnt in fight club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tylers true identity was cryptically shown and when you watched it again you saw more it really was a work of genius how it was written laid out and directed this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist i think it was wild things that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasnt trying too hard to be a big twist its like the ci2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever but really its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end the film ended almost immediately afterward with the whole film void by sebastians whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl acting  the actors in this film are appalling almost as bad a sunset beach  extremely corny and badly performed its not even so bad its good like hunk the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn it was a rigid pathetic and badly thought out performance by her robin dunne was also poor i havent seen american psycho ii yet but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film alsobr br i cant even say it is a good film for teens as its not if my son or daughter liked this film id be ashamed but they wouldnt anyway as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film which this film has none of really im disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age bracket for this film and so dislike it i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste also do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly dont like any teenish story lines no i liked mean girls and other generic teen films and watch beverly hills 90210 all the time theres no excuse for poor directing acting and screenplay im afraid besides i was 1617 when i first watched it if anything being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film i cant believe anyone can give it 1010 either one of my favourite films is memento and i gave it 9 as i know there can be better it is a shame for this site that people do that give 10s flippantly or dont get the filmsshow and so give it 2br br anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste and perhaps their lives and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made worse than loch nessbr br if you arent a teenager with bad taste or simply dont have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film
