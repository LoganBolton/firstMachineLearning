i think this is probably one of the worst movies ive watched in a long timebr br trying to get the same characters with different people is such a bad idea if they couldnt get sara michelle g and ryan p in this one they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did i seriously felt like i was at a high school or bad college play with the lever of acting these people put forthbr br where do they get some of these people was this their first movie it sure seemed like itbr br this movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech i had just got done watching the first one and popped 2 in i was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show ive seen in a while i dont hardly ever ever turn off a movie but this one definitely went off after about 30  40 min
