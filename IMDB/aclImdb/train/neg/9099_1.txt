this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie  so if you havent seen either movie and want to but dont want the spoilers please dont read this reviewbr br while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions the actors that they had portray ryan phillippes christian and sarah michelle gellars kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed neither can pull off the smarmy snooty richkid attitude that the original actors did its absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim  not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough youll recognize it there are also inconsistencies in the plot  if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese witherspoons characterbr br also the tiein with the photographyyou could be a model comment at the end was totally lame and didnt add anything at all overall this movie was a waste of time i cant believe they made a cruel intentions 3
