dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film the way it is shot lit acted etc just doesnt make sense its all so bad it is difficult to watch loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom there seems to be no normal person in the entire film and the existence of the outside world is well it just doesnt exist and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden this film is beyond stupidity zero
