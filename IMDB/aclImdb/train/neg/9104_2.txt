br br when i first started watching this movie last night on cinemax i was shocked that it had been made cruel intentions in my opinion was one of the best teenoriented films made in years this prequel had certain things incongruent with the original sebastians father married into wealth then why does he have a rich aunt on long islandbr br then i found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie but rather a television series manchester prep after hearing that it made sense to me that it wasnt the same as the movie just as buffy the vampire slayer is different in tv form br br i think that roger kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had after the series wasnt picked up by fox it just seems like something that would happen too fast sebastian becoming the male version of katharyn and i just dont know where they would go with the next episode since it wouldnt be leading to the 1999 film which the newer ending is directed right towardsbr br one thing i didnt like was that it suggested sebastian and his father had married into the wealth which isnt typically looked good upon in this area of new york and sine katharyns mother was just an adult version of her it didnt seem like something a woman in her position would do marry a man not of her social class br br as a prequel this is fairly lame but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series
