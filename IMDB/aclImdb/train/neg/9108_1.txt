this socalled prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of dangerous liasons the plots are identical as is most of the script i loved the book its based off of and i loved the first movie but im not even going to bother with the 3rd movie the pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal andi just cant stress how bad the movie was if you dont want to take my word for it just watch it and youll see what i mean if youve read a review that says that if you likes the first one youll like the second one the only reason that is is because it is the exact same movie although the plot is not even as good they took so many lines from the first movie its hard to tell which movie youre watching
