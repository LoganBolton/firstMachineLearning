the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of nobrainer comedy to a point where it just got boring some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humorbr br there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script lena endre was good looking as alwaysbr br i dont remember the original movie so i cant say if its better or worsebr br if you enjoy movies like s√§llskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at
