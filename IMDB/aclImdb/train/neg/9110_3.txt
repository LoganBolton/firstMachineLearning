i watched this movie at 3o clock in the morning a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies but still i think it wasnt good this movie wasnt good at all the reasons why are manybr br the acting isnt all that good and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90s chevy chase comedy i mean come on like the handcuff situation and the poker situation amongst the servants this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one and thats ok but if i hadnt seen the first one before seeing this it would have sucked even worse like the ending it came very suddenly and i felt like i got no closure what so ever sebastian changed very suddenly and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1 and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good the score is the same as in the first one and it didnt feel like a movie at allbr br they should have handled the situations with more style and class but they didnt and therefore this movie turned out bad
