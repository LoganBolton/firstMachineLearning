cruel intentions 2 is bloody awful i mean uberbad words can not explain how bad it is but ill give it a go anywaybr br the plot of cruel intentions 2 is very similar to the first film sebastian robin dunne is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to new york there he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down unfortunately he has to deal with his stepsister kathryn amy adams wants to drag him down sebastain starts to fall in love danielle sarah thompson the innocent daughter of the headmaster of the school kathryn wants sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a whorehouse kathryn also wants to get revenge with cherie keri lynn pratt who humiliated her during the school assembly kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school a similar subplot to the first filmbr br cruel intentions 2 is basically a cancelled tvshow which was turned into a prequel there are so many problems with the film it is poorly written unfunny and badly acted luckily for amy adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress whilst cruel intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world cruel intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazoncouk a randy version of saved by the bell there were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film but in cruel intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldnt be such as kathryn having an affair with a teacher other ideas also dont work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students the film also had a major problem of sexualised 1516yearsold i know that teenagers do have sex sometimes a lot but when done on film or television is treated very seriously one famous sense was when daneille encourages cherie who is around 1415 in the film to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm the idea of turning a girl around 1415 into a slut is just very wrong with me and shouldnt be made into a subject of comedy the jokes in the film fall flat whether if its a verbal gag like she goes all moist when she sees you to a visual gag where sebastian pushes kathryn face first into mudbr br there is a lot wrong with this film which i dont have time to go into but i say it should be avoid just watch cruel intentions whilst not a classic still is a decent film and treats the subject matter wellbr br this film is just a perverts wet dream having schoolkids having lots of sex with each other
