they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel its actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded fwords and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesnt explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i cant remember i was not impressed at all by robins acting but amy did a great job thats about the only thing that reconciled this movie
