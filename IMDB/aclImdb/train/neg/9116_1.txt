there isnt one decent scenebr br amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time proof that you a can start anywhere the guy playing sebastian sucks too he doesnt even look much like ryan phillipe more like joshua jackson the two other girls are terrible as well br br then the dialogue is also crapbr br sebastian about to have threesome if you cant beat them br br virgin girl who says you cant beat embr br lamebr br the ending contradicts the entire plot of the original in the first film it is clearly stated that kathryn and sebastian never had sex one of the reasons sebastian wanted kathryn so bad aside from the fact that shes played by sarah michelle gellar was that she was the only girl he couldnt have and it killed him she was a tease who liked playing with him the fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting then in this pos it implies that he can have her along with a girl on the side what and we dont even see the sex either its implied making it not only stupid pointless and contradictory but worthless toobr br and in the first one kathryn rejects sebastian because he fell in love making him a loser even though he won the bet that crumbled his chances then in this excrement he looses and falls in love so she doesnt screw losers only complete losers another thing its stated that sebastian has never been in love so what do you call the thing with virgin girlbr br then at the end virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be kathryns evil lesbian lover dun dun dun and like i said they go into a lame offscreen threesome stupid br br theres several other plot contradictions did the writer even see the first film a 5 year old can point his stuff outbr br after the threesome sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while kathryn and virgin girl turned evil lesbian in lame sudden plot twist sit in the front listen and smile evilly into the camera br br the end br br seeing sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film i guess all it took to make little sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls interesting
