 or maybe it just is this bad the plot is a cheap rehash of the first which is weird since its supposed to be a prequel not a sequel pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely where the first had a great cast this one consist of blist actors and rejects the acting is mostly horrendously bad half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first as is nearly every major character including the ones who werent in the first movie i realize this was made up by a tv series pilot episode but thats no excuse they didnt have to turn the bad footage into a movie only one thing is marginally good and thats the erotic sequences however as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first even this isnt raising it above a rating of 1 if you have a chance to see it for free and youre a straight guy it could be worth checking out if you want something erotic that isnt porn if not avoid at all costs 110
