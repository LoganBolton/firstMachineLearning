this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made br br it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006br br ive never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie it shouldnt be that obvious br br i cant understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie it is gone for sure now br br ive heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i cant understand how that is even possible
