its one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising i have spoken before on another filmin which the commercial for the comedy film makes it seem funnier than it is seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film what i and my brother who went and saw it with me didnt know is that the scene used in the tv ad was the very last scene in the film br br since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the filmi can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use the last scene isthanks to a youth potiondr fu manchu turns from a long bearded old maninto a bright young asianelvis like rock star with back up singers no less br br set for no real reasonin the 1930speter sellers does his best with the material at hand but hes not given any really good reason for his comedic moments the rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and i sat all through this barely laughing at anything it was only natural that we were expecting a pink panther type comedypeter sellers was so great at that br br its a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died his appearance on the muppet show was more entertaining than this illconceived flop stilli dont fault him i fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this 2 stars is being generous
