even if one didnt realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the films release the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu would be painful viewing it is supposedly a lampoon of sax rohmers famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus the potential for satirical commentary on the antioriental overtones of rohmers concept are ignored indeed the movie employs racist insults there are hardly any actual jokes or gags just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines it is especially distressing to see sid caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs most of the other actors embarrass themselves as wellbr br and then theres peter sellers he plays the dual roles of the sinister fu manchu who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart british foe nayland smith sellers isnt one hundred per cent bad he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and hes oddly moving as manchu when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment but most of the time he plays both roles with a weary grimness thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities sellers routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny br br a few genuinely witty lines an apt slapstick bit by burt kwouk cato in the pink panther films as one of manchus minions and helen mirrens amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius they wont learn anything from the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu
