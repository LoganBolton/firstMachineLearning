theres no getting around it this movie is terrible ive seen the old christopher leefu manchu movies im familiar with the characters and its serial origins but its still just godawful however peter sellers genius still shines through with his portrayal of nayland smith with echoes of sadness tragedy and strength simmering through a stoic facade its a performance i place on par with peter cushings portrayal of van helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all cushings dracula movies if the movie was done in a more seriocomic vein like bubba hotep by way of the 1960s avengers tv show this couldve been something special if youre a fu manchu or peter sellers completest this is something you need to see but its a pass for anyone else
