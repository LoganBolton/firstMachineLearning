for one of the worst swedish movies everforgive me for being dullbr br first of all i havent seen the first one i was bored thats my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one well i hope the first one is better than this it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes for the people that have seen this and think 410 is high belive me so do i but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea whats next det sjunde inseglet ii sequels not based on novel or book doesnt turning out great to often and this is a perfect example of onebr br ok im gonna be honest with you i did laugh a bit it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor but dont buy it rent it just let some other idiot do it or download itbr br 410 this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already
