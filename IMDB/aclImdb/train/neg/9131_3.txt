i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than 25 yearsbr br some time back i watched 6 fu films in a row boris karloff and all 5 chris lees the last 2 lees both directed and i use that word loosely by jess franco were abominable at the time i skipped this one remembering that in some ways it was even worsebr br well i watched it never again you know whats worse that an abominable film a really wellmade piece of s and thats what fiendish plot is it is a very goodlooking movie great production design sets costumes music photography editing mostly good cast some decent actingbr br and absolutely positively one of the worst scripts in movie history aaaugh the first minute of the film is so deceptive one might mistake this for a decent movie and then they start singing happy birthday to fu and it goes downhill having burt kwouk of whom his master says your face is familiar accidentally pour out fus elixir vitae to put out a fire resulting in his being condemned to torture burial and having one of his ears cut off was the closest thing to funny they had it was like someone decided they wanted to do a campy film so ridiculous it would be funny ridiculous it is funny it aint at allbr br its sad because its clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu manchu series in order to get so much of it right with a different script either a really funny one or a dead serious one they might have could have should have had a classic on their hands a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces by comparisonbr br there was a period in the late 70s when a whole slew of classic 30s characters were revived in movies that were universally awful buck rogers flash gordon tarzan the lone ranger charlie chan even doc savage im not sure this one may be the worst of the lot it took great selfcontrol not to fastforward over whole sections of it especially any scenes containing sid caesar fbi chief who was also al capones cousin you see what i mean it isnt just that the ideas in the film arent funny they often make no sense whatsoever like when they audition police officers to impersonate the king and queen and we wind up seeing people audition dancehall routines like singing dancing and riding a unicycle how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them br br as i said a shame and a real waste of all that talent including that of peter sellers who played both fu and nayland smith burt kwouk whod been in a chris lee fu film in his time helen mirren the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last halfhour of the film i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a proper fu manchu film or if fans will have to settle for karloffs being almost the only one
