this is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on dvdbr br television moved out of my life in 1981 so i never followed the series or any part of it  which means that im immune to the nostalgic charm that moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers br br possible spoiler warning br br the pilot of moonlighting is your basic caveman meets fluffball yarn where a charming redblooded heman manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs the premises that the scripts wit is based on must have already felt stale around 1950 it also contains some frankly bad writing as in the scene where maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance br br i often feel that susan faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment but in this particular case im all with her  moonlighting has backlash stamped all over it br br in one sense however this dvd is a must for all serious bruce willis fans in addition to the pilot episode it contains the screen test that landed willis the job both features show to what amazing extent willis acting ability developed between 1985 and 198889 die hard 1 in country impressive br br rating and i am a bruce willis fan 2 out of 10
