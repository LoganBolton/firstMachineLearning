oh sam mraovich we know you tried so hard this is your magnum opus a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as you state on your 1998era web site alas its better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt with ben  arthur you do just thatbr br seemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education the films screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene its this insane excuse of a story that may also be the films best ally beginning tepidly the homosexually titular characters ben and arthur attempt to marry going so far as to fly across country to do so in the shade of vermonts finest palm trees but all of this posturing is merely a leadin for blood then more blood and more and more blood i mean there must be at least 20 in fake blood makeup in the final third of this filmbr br the film in its entirety is a technical gaffe from the sound to the editing to the music which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard its a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on its such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted herebr br no matter sam im sure youve made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls such as myself to view this film sadly were not laughing with you
