when the film began i was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera in fact the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie even direct to dvd films should have production values better than this heck a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to youtube have better production values all too often the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it onwith no camera person closeups and anything resembling camerawork are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups yecch br br the film is about two gay men who want to become married as if was made almost a decade ago their only option was marrying in vermonttimes have definitely changed however the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this filmif anything it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue according to the film religious people are onedimensional idiots who carry bibles everywhere and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrowminded when they learn their spouses have been living a liego figure im sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue br br the bottom linenothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and i even hesitate to call this a film its more like a home movie and doesnt even merit a listing on imdb or even inclusion on imdbs bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time the acting is horrible the writing is horrible the direction if there even is any is horrible the camerawork is horrible and the plot is horrible its a home movie there is nothing positive i can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of ed wood seem like oscar contenders in comparison and i am sure the ghost of mr wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess br br i dont care if you are gay or straightthis film is not worth your time and i dont know how they managed to create dvds of it i assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time seriously this gives new meaning to the word badbr br by the way if the one lady in the film was a real lawyer wouldnt the ability to read be an important prerequisite im just sayinbr br finally with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic cant we have a film thats better than this that addresses the issue this one sadly only invites laughter
