phewi dont what to say this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers some of the acting reminded me of john waters early offerings perhaps i should take that backi dont want to insult waters ability as a directorstorytellerbr br i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility clause its full faith and credit by the waybr br this also reminds me of the conrad boys where the main actor is also the writer director film editor etc those sort of multiinvolved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt some might say to pull something off like that
