this movie is just truly awful the eyecandy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this moviebr br the writerdirectorproducerlead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage family acceptance religion homophobia hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causesbr br the script is poor the casting very ordinary but the dialogue and acting is just woeful the homohating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors i think ive seen more passion in an corn flakes ad the acting is stiff and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlightbr br im just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution and if he is thinking of doing so i have some advise  just dont do it
