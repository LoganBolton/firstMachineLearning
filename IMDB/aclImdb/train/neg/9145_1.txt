let me first state that i enjoy watching bad movies its funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way this vehicle for sam mraovichs delusional ego doesnt just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words this should forever be the barometer for bad movies sort of the mendoza line for film mr mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital equality as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married ben  arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and hamfisted trademark mraovich that you cant possibly take any of them seriously arthurs brother victor the bible toting jesus freak is so horribly overthetop evileffeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role thats because sam multitasking mraovich was also casting director the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself when you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind sam also delivers lines like dominos pizza cold and usually wrong the final tally you suck at writing directing acting and casting thats the ed wood quadruple crown congratulations you horrible little man
