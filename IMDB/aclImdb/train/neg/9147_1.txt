i have no idea what on earth or beyond could have possibly made sam mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake ben  arthur is one of the worst movies ever made in fact i see no reason why it should not be at 1 on the bottom 100 for although i have not seen for example superbabies baby geniuses 2 5 at the time of this publication i would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound because even in its vapid dismalness at least baby geniuses 2 was professionally made by contrast everything and i do mean everything in this film is completely unprofessionalbr br the movie is intended to be an attack on the christian rights supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays and i do emphasize intended not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose it also leaves an ugly scar instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couples struggle against a society that largely opposes them it creates tired crass stereotypes of each party involved ben and arthur the namesake couple are portrayed as two crude sexstarved and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so this meets with the opposition of bens brother victor a christian minister who like all christians as this movie would have us believe is loud prying stupid and violent he tries to kill ben and arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry just like in real life and if you think thats dreadful it is you havent seen it allbr br the actors  here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a youtube home comedy video but not even daniel daylewis and marlon brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laughinducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote for example in one scene victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brothers homosexuality but instead of portraying this idea clearly he spits out the stupid utterly confusing whinysounding line you know what im never going to have any nieces or nephews okay because youre so fed upbr br even more glaring is the complete lack of production values yes i know this aint the dark knight but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing for example six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds people do not teleport across a room between takes and objects do not fall forward when shot br br do not waste your money on ben  arthur i dont care if youre 7 17 or 107 i dont care if youre gay straight bi or undecided i dont care if youre just curious i dont care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dungheap stay away far away this movies only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a frisbee
