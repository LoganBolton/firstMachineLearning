review in english since swedish is not allowedbr br i saw this movie with extremely low expectations and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to thembr br as much as i loved to see janne loffe karlsson on the big screen again the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water isnt original or funny the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable the ones that aint is just plain boring i smiled like three times during the entire filmbr br the placement of swedish findus products is unintentionally funny why not just a big sign saying findus made it happenbr br g√∂ta kanal 2 doesnt need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd just wait for it to air on tv it wont take too long
