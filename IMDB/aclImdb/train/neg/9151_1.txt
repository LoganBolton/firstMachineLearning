holy crap this movie was bad i watched it just as a joke it isnt even so bad that its good in an unintentional way this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry it worked really well at doing that its as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese thats all this is cheese there isnt a single person this film could possibly connect to there isnt any universe this film could possibly take place in why cant a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is why couldnt they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a bmovie now that i think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all no im not joking thats what its about does that sound good this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion with its stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks the film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game its so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i wasnt able to fully pay attention to this film the makers of this trainwreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting there isnt even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste this is trash in a perfect world this film would get voted a 00 its worth 0 as a film alone a mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and shed probably be a better actor as well the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini xmas tree and then record that and ive already made a film that will always be better than ben  arthur by at least half there are only two things worse than death torture and watching ben  arthur im a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and i dont think ive ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone if this movie was a mistake i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase its okay to make mistakes to its okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben  arthur you know how people always say things like good things come out of everything i think that ben  arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of to call this movie the worst movie ive ever seen would be giving it way too much credit its as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of its very own there are good movies there are bad movies and then theres ben  arthur this is ben and arthur
