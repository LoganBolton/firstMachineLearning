intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant ripoff i do not make this observation lightly  i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1600 films 93 on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise  aimee  jaguar its in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic followup or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist  right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that its difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay  and nelly stereotypes to boot the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of sugarplams is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to queer culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at 995 this film would have been way overpriced i understand that its soon to be repriced under 20 which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of 2995 and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director  writer  actor in such a way that its obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars  or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it
