i have never posted a review before but i had to do it for this film this film is so bad i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody but it isnt it is truly unselfconsciously bad this is a serious attempt that flops gloriously other reviewers have pointed out the films many flaws so ill try not to repeat these but i do urge you to see this film throughout it i was either speechless literally gasping with disbelief or rolling on the floor in hysterics i havent had so much fun watching a film in years in fact im going to try to get all my friends to see it because its the kind of movie that needs to be sharedbr br my favorite parts  when arthur auditions to be a gogo boy his dancing is unbelievable  the gratuitous nudity the directorleading actor just had to get a nude shot in  the preachers office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of christ  of course the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings what narrative function does this play  the exwifes wrestling match with ben to get possession of her gun  the detailed sequence wherein arthur kills the preacher he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match  yes the gay religiousfanatic brother with his bleached hair and weho fashions  and my favorite the use of joplins the entertainer as the opening soundtrack and pachebels canon in d major as the closing soundtrack  the list goes on and on  a must see
