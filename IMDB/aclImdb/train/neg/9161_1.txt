well pop this into the dvd waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back and find outbr br acting what acting br br production values production valuesbr br story dont get me startedbr br after many years of posting on imdb i never thought i would see a film so bad that i truly wished for a lower rating than one i always have found at least a reason or two to see merit  if only in the intent or the effort of the writer the director the cast or the producerbr br in this case theyre all the same guy  who really needs to get a handle on the fact at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape that he has no talent i mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schoolers production for his first cinema class but the referenced artist behind this dreck was twentysix at the time of this miscarriage br br just how did this ever get made who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this moreover dont let the box cover fool you theres not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good exposure of the hunk on that coverbr br two final items there was one second when this film had redeeming value the aforementioned talent gets roundly punched out by his lover i cheered and i did learn one thing from this film there are times when something is so very bad that it is indeed truly very funny but not in any comical manner its just sadly humorous very sadly humorous
