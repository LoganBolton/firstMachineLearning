the leap years is a movie adapted from an enovella by singapore writer catherine lim which became the first singapore novelnovella to be sold over the internet the film had a tortuous postproduction schedule shot in early 2005 it was slated for release at the end of 2005 but only turn up eventually 3 years later on the 29th february 2008 a leap yearbr br before i say anything i must first admit im no fan of the romance genre so i may be a little biased against this film  i watched it merely because it was a singapore production and that its available for borrowing at my neighborhood library heres my two cents on the moviebr br lets just start by saying that other than qi yuwus ks and wong lilin everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian the love interest is a eurasian ananda everingham and wongs trio of buddies are all erhem eurasians does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more in than the common chinese or whatever asian race you are i dont know it sure seems that way also everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical anglified accent which doesnt exist anywhere certainly not in singapore its the kind of semiperfect english that authorities would like us speak but which doesnt exist anywhere outside say the mtv channel the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted not helped by the lack of trueblue singaporeans in the castbr br the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string oneliners after oneliners after twenty minutes the wit of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clich√©s br br i guess i didnt enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable br br there are other incredulities in the film i cant for one believe that ks played by qi yuwu would fall for one of wongs girlfriends and the scene where the bridegroom says go before i change my mind has been used in a hundred east asian korean chinese hong kong taiwanese etc tv serialsbr br so 4 stars for this film the production value is fair and wong lilin tries her best but shes not helped by the script joan chen has a 15minute bitpart in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot but hey her role is just cameobr br if you come across the leap years in the rental or library you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiositys sake but otherwise for people who dont exactly enjoy the romance genre you can decide whether or not to give it a miss
