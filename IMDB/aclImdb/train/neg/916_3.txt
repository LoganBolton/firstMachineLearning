lauren bacall and charles boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 filmbr br there is a good story here about the axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war unfortunately this part of the story is not emphasized instead we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer by the way bacall is as british as vladimir putinbr br the real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner katina paxinou as was the case with her memorable pilar in the 1943 oscar winner for whom the bell tolls paxinou again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a doublecrossing counterspy for the profranco group she is quite a vicious character hereespecially when she throws a 14 year old child out the window she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide
