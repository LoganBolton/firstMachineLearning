when i go to see a movie about zombies im not expecting oscar calibre performances or writing on the level of the godfather but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesnt sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera this movie was just awful i actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek manor that wasnt very good either but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap on the plus side the girls were very pretty thats probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes in fact i left after the hottest one got killed there wasnt anything to hold my interest after that
