i usually like zombie movies but this one was just plain badbr br the good parts girl swimming topless with thong bottoms sonya salomaas topless and ona grauers boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ranbr br the bad part too much video cuts too much matrix slow motion it drags the action not enough blood and guts bad acting and no story the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene a total waste of 6 and time i give it a 2 out of 10
