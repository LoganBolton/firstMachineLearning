it is cheese if all you want is a video game complete with what look like straightfromthecomputer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for this is it my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit this movie really requires hecklingbr br plot there was a plot ok some stupid college or later types get invited to the rave of the year and go to one of the san juan islands if theyd only stayed back in seattle they would have survived  direct quote or nearly to attend they get there and everyone is gone and the site is somewhat wrecked but hey the keg is still full with the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman who acted only slightly less tough  and slightly less well  than cynthia rothrock they fight lots of zombies some which spit acid get an earful of freaky legends and mostly get killed thats about itbr br its not quite as bad as demonicus but not by much and still better than severed they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies  the former is bad but fun to heckle and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once on the other hand if youre expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil run away run away nowbr br ok some real big questions without too many spoilers since when did spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the pacific northwest why is anyone in the pacific northwest smuggling guns and to whom  canada for crying out loud why is a rave on an unnamed oh excuse me its called isla del muerto shya right san juan island  and outdoors still keeping in mind this is the pacific northwet and the rave has about 30 people in attendance  the rave of the year my patootbr br lucky thing theres lots of hatchets around lots of them everyone has them must be a hatchet sales outlet nearbybr br finally while the movie started out playing with a little parody with nudges at i know what you did and jaws it didnt carry it through near enoughbr br ok really finally  when the introductory comments in a voiceover no less casually mention that one of the characters gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing you can be darn sure therell be some fencing by the end of the movie not good fencing but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords anyway
