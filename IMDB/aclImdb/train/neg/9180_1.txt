okay let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone whos read the other comments that being said my gd this movie reeked i mean wow i didnt know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than any roger corman movie corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script the only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said hey zombies are popular video games are popular what game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it resident evil no someone else got there first silent hill no too silent people will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly hey didnt sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies theyre out of the platform biz we could get that for penniesbr br basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the gamebr br the first and major problem is that the original game was horrid i meanbr br badmoviemerchandisingmadeintoaworsegameintwoweeksandthenshippe doutandboughtbymoronsandtheirparentsforchristmas horrid the graphics were boring the monsters were boring the levels were boring the interface was boring the case was boring in other words this was a boring game and that was the arcade version the home version was even worse with the home version you didnt even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game but i digressbr br the second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes huh didnt the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on not to mention that every fight was shot from the perspective of a video game which may explain the tedious use of matrixstyle effects the problem with this is that the game was a firstperson shooter the player proceeds from the pov of the character maybe thats why they put in the game graphics to let you know that they were alluding to the game right whateverbr br anyway the only thing that made this entire experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didnt get me kicked outbr br to sum up dont go see this movie dont even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week run just run
