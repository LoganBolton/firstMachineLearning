if there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10 this would be it house of the dead redefines the term bad movie other bad movies such as when a stranger calls or premonition will actually look much better when compared to house of the dead the basic plot of house of the dead is a group of twentysomethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century when they get there they only find some tents a bar a stage and some bloody tshirts they decide to stay anyway and they are soon attacked by zombiesbr br there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie it is not entertaining instead it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is the acting is unbelievably bad in a dvd interview one of the actors claimed that uwe boll the director is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene this is a blatant lie the script appears to have been written by an 11yearold who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girls chest and to include the hilarious line it smells like someone farted out here the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie somewhere along the way the characters also magically transform into a swat team to take down the zombies its like they dont even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the headbr br the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing there is something wrong with uwe boll bolls camera work is astonishingly disjointed his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing worse yet boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie quite often and at the most random times you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot it makes no sense no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea its like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes a la the matrix unfortunately he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating the soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track this also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious house of the deadbr br house of the dead isnt bad because its based on a video game in fact it has very little to do with the video game it also does not fit into the category of so bad that its good it does however fit into the category of so bad that its painful this movie just plain sucks uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set even his presence will curse a production to all the directors out there whenever one of your movies gets a bad review all you have to do is remember that you didnt make house of the dead and you will feel much better i will never get those 90 minutes of my life back to sum it up words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is everyone involved in the production of this film especially uwe boll should be ashamed of themselves although what i have said may make house of the dead sound funny it really isnt nothing about it is funny avoid this at all costs
