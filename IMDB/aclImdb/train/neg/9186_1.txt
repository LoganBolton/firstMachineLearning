you know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film thats trying so hard to be a serious thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably when you cant help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen house of the dead struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinemabr br from start to end house of the dead manages to recreate the feeling like youve just woken up to find out that the cat has laid its curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept it is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size which they exploit shamelessly whereas the males for their hardcore kickass attitude i honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture uwe boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie at least then well get better actingÂ… however not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film it is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as these are zombies pure and simple and no capn we must not go there its evilbr br we all know that zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror trash yes but entertaining trash not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins according to imdb house of the dead received such bad reviews that no danish cinemas bought the movie if only we could have had the same privilegebr br final score 110
