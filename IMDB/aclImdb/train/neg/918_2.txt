when george c scott played the title role in patton you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist shooting at german dive bombers with a revolver and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike the most action we get from gregory peck as macarthur a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of hisbr br comparing pecks performance with scotts may be unfair yet the fact macarthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at west point its clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that oscarwinning film of a few years before but while peck looks the part more than scott ever did he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a wikipedia walkthrough of macarthurs later careerbr br to this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived an opening title crawl tells us its a typical dishwater bit of postvietnam sophistry about those who led americas military very much of its time but what we get here is neither view macarthur as presented here doesnt anger or inspire the way he did in lifebr br director joseph sargent who went on to helm the famous turkey jaws the revenge does a paintbynumbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the chinese attack us forces in korea while the script by hal barwood and matthew robbins trots out a macarthur who comes across as goodnatured to the point of blandness a bit too caught up in his public image but never less than decentbr br here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the phillipines there you see him addressing congress in his old soldiers never die speech for a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in toyko waiting for the north koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details japans rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule pecks coactors marj dusay as his devoted wife youre my finest soldier and nicolas coaster as a loyal aide burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companions magnificence but garner no interest on their ownbr br even when he argues with others peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence when admiral nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the philippines a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for macarthur macarthur comes back with the comment just now as i listened to his plan i thought i saw our flag going down doubtless the real nimitz would have had something to say about that but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of president rooseveltbr br the only person in the movie who macarthur seriously disagrees with is harry s truman who ed flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble toucan sam trumans firing of macarthur should be a dramatic high point but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation in which peck plays macarthur as nothing less than a genial martyrbr br ive never been sold by pecks standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his bestknown roles but its unfair to dock him so much here as he gets little help defining macarthur as anything other than a speechifying bore except for two scenes one where he rails against the surrender of the philippines he struck old glory and ran up a bedsheet and another where he has a minibreakdown while awaiting the us invasion of inchon inveighing against communists undermining him at the white house peck really plays peck here not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet american caesar the real macarthur might have been worthy of such a comparison what you get here is less worthy of shakespeare than shakes the clown
