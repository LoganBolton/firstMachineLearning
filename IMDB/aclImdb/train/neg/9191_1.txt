well i had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze why because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is its unbelievably bad just to let you in on how bad it is ill offer this little detail about the movie during scenes of mayhem which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies they intercut scenes from the video game yes you heard me right this movie really sucks in fact it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days and to see corn filled crap like this there is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills im really disappointed with this knowing that i watched it ok im dumbstruck its so bad i cant even find the words rating zero out of
