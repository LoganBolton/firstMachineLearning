i found this movie in the horror section of my video store that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there from romeros dead trilogy to 28 days later however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really isbr br it is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory there is no horror here folks just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe youre dvd player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie its a pity i think anyone could find a better use for 7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud though some of the 360 effects were cool but once again they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time just with a different characterbr br also what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game ive played the game it sucks so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and its a poor one at that 310br br rated r a lot of violencegore and profanity
