laid up and drugged out as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semioblivion i happened to catch this movie on cable i wouldnt want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema or rented it or  heaven forfend  that i watched it straightbr br having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of the house battling chariot type 27 the hanged man type 041 and other impossible sentinels my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screenbr br it doesntbr br the banal plot revolves around a group of crazy kids  a la scooby doo  attending a remote island for a worldshaking rave  whatever that is you kids today with your hulahoops and your miniskirts and your pat boone after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric they find the rave desertedbr br passing mention is made of a house  presumably the titular house of the dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residencebr br a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler showing the island in the throes of a  party is that it oh so this rave thingy is just a party in the grand tradition of reeuphemizing used cars as preowned or shell shock as posttraumatic stress disorder the word party is now too square for you drugaddled siliconeimplanted metrosexual jagoffs br br it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies intelligent thought stops herebr br i dont think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie reanimation zombies cant die  theyre already undead they do not bleed they know no pain unless their bodies are completely annihilated they will continue being animated at least thats what my jamaican witch priestess tells mebr br which means that a 45 shot into their hearts is not going to stop them nor will a machete to the torso and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood at least in the video games logic the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated leaving a fetid mush that cannot reanimate itselfbr br yet each actorslashmodel gets their matrixcircularcamera moment slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum seriously these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from return of the jedi who get knocked out when ewoks trip thembr br i suppose the films writer mark altman having penned the nottooshabby free enterprise felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference in the character of jurgen prochnow who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dungswill there is also a reference to prochnows primo role in the magnificent das boot when one of the untrained bactors mentions that he looks like a uboat captain  i wonder how many of this movies target audience of squareeyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films as when prochnow declares say hello to my little friend presaging his machine gun moment br br aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the videogame concept ie the game ends when you die  you cannot win this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart accordingly everyone dies in due course except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white peoplebr br a better use for this films scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school although ona grauers left breast did a good job as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes priceless i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like shes been stabbed but looking like shes just eaten ice cream too fastbr br attempting to do something more constructive with my time i pulled out my digitallyrestored 35th anniversary special edition widescreen anamorphic dvd of manos the hands of fate ah yes  the drugs were suitably brainnumbing  now here was some quality filmmakingbr br movie maniacs visit wwwpoffysmoviemaniacom
