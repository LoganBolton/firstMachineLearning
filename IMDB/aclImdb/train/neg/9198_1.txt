there are people out there who will greenlight anything that is the only explanation i can offer as to why the house of the dead movie exists and thats only scary part to the whole movie its so bad youll go off movies forever i seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the tv over to the paint drying channel but i was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing i dont know why i do these bad things to myselfbr br as if it matters heres the basic jist of the story a group of twentysomethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the pacific northwest canada actually because its cheap for the rave of the century which consists of about 8 people and unraving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry thats gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough the fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead hang oni thought this was house of the dead and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yaddabr br first faults here why would a tiny little rave of the century my foot be held on some remote island why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the othersbr br once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about 2 tents a small stage and a portajohn has been smashed theres blood everywhere and no one is around what would any rationally thinking person do run for their lives of course but no these clueless obviously blind people decide to go look for them soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house thats 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again the characters like the movie go nowherebr br jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue heinous acting mumbojumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the oncepopular arcade game of the same name why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers ill never know the clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further if that is at all possiblebr br it has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap throwaway line at the end it makes resident evil look like cinematic glory hell even the double dragon movie seems multioscar worthy in comparison to this junk the only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is jurgen prochnow he could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character the rest of the cast suck im afraid the characters are idiots and deserve to diebr br plus if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity i see no reason why this film cannot be shown on saturday morning tv its not frightening in the slightest pirates of the caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film and where did all those bad guys come from anyway there were only a few people on the island to begin with i guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over i kid you not youll see the same zombie die a dozen timesbr br whos ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid none other than director uwe boll his control over the movie is nonexistent you can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies arent really taking it all seriously the actors seem like theyre reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card it all feels very unnaturalbr br plus the film is shot like a twopart miniseries i have indeed seen better tv productions and dont get me started on the editing the film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans no real skill or talent was put into making this at all it truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and george a romero cant even get anyone to take his calls house of the dead makes some idiotic reference to romero in a lazy attempt to be postmodern but it only irritates that they think this is in the same league as a real zombie moviebr br for what its worth the 1851 anamorphic picture looks great and the dolby 51 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily overused adr even more the dvd comes with extras but why torture yourself isnt this review warning enough stay away you are all doomed i tell you doomed doomed
