although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i sawbr br the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet onbr br in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off geez hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didnt start shouting  none shall pass and  its only a flesh wound ive had worse it was one of the funniest scenes ive seen in the past yearbr br the gladiatordemon was a stitch too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hystericalbr br truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on filmbr br
