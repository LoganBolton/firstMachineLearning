this is the movie that epitomizes the dd fear of the 80s and even today the fear being that people who play dd or any other roleplaying game for that matter will be sucked in and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy and go on killing sprees child sacrifices suicide etc great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects but anyone who has played a roleplaying game a video game or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence it is to dd what wargames was to computers plus as a movie it just kinda sucks
