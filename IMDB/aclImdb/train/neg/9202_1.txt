i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the storyline was not that bad as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if youre into super geekycheese romantic scenes youll enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like drspockunable to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if youre up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real storys much more interesting though br br if i had to sum up this film in one word it would bebr br lame
