many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast legions of hanksphiles out there that tom did in fact make crappy films i think bachelor party was great but thats another story the movie focuses on a dungeons and dragonsstyle game that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness the story is charmingly early 1980s focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil roleplaying gamesbr br i however prefer to view mazes and monsters as the turning point in the whatever happened to chris makepeace story we all remember him as rudy the rabbit in meatballs and as the hapless clifford in my bodyguard where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon few could argue especially those of us who read dynamite on a regular basis that great things were in store for himbr br and then came rona jaffe the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeaces performance in this is all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was vamp and that was 1986 he had a small role as sean penns brother in falcon and the snowman but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumesbr br i cant in good conscience recommend this movie watch it if only to see a younger more idealistic chris makepeace before rona jaffe feasted on his soul
