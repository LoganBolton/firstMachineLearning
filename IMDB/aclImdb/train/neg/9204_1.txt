i have seen this movie many times and recently read the book the movie is based on and every time i see it i just want to slap all four of them the fact that they dont clue in to the fact that tom hanks character is flipping into his ddoops mm  persona oh hes just acting in character outside of the gaming session that and the fact that after three months of therapy lets just destroy all that and feed his delusions these kind of people are what give rpgs a bad namebr br also the corny love ballad and the music done by cat on a piano and stop us if we get too annoying are almost enough to set your teeth on edge
