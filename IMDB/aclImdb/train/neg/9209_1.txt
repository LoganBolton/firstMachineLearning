first off i knew nothing about mazes and monster before i watched it i had no knowledge of the roleplaying controversy behind it or the fact that it was a madefortv movie when i looked at the cover the updated dvd one i seriously thought it would be another fantasy adventure like legend with tom hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters sounds exciting right that is what the cover suggests to you at first glance i was given this movie as a gift obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows im into action movies with a medieval myth theme and it has tom hanks one of my favorite actors so i popped this movie in expecting a feel good movie with tom hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laughbr br no none of this happens now before i continue i will confess i am a nerd but i have no interest in roleplaying games that is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best and mm copyright infringement is not even a feel good roleplaying based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness no this is an antiroleplaying movie that must have been made by some religious folk the same people who also think barney is the work of satan i understand satan is a crafty fellow but i dont think he is desperate enough for soul to lull rpg lovers into worship him this movie is thee antigamer movie this is what i get from this movie it hates rpgs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in roleplaying but it makes poor tom hanks a mental patientbr br tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in castaway poor guy was alone but tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the volleyball as a lovable character through toms good acting i wish i watched that movie instead of this in this movie tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature it looks like a poorly made mascot for a rpg team and has a split personality that is creepy at best toms acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else i get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic i am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to mm made me feel like crp luckily i watched hudson hawk afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further yah hh surpasses mm by    a lot this is not one of toms better films in fact it is thee most depressing movie ive ever seen him in even saving private ryan is not this depressing i walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and i ended up feeling the exact opposite if you want to watch a sad both emotionally and visually movie then by all means watch this if this movie is to convey a message it is this dont play rpgs if you are cuckoo for cocopuffs
