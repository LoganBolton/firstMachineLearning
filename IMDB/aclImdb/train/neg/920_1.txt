seriously i just wrapped up my first viewing of demonicus and words have failed mebr br i remember a time when i would see charles bands name on a film and my heart would race he was never a wes craven or a john carpenter he was a bastion of hope for the little man the guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endurebr br and now thisbr br a painfullyobvious californian walking trail doubles for the alps and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be an ancient cave i mean they didnt even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ugh instead of a creepy demon gladiator as the cover implies were treated to a dude wearing the latest in walmart halloween apparel theres a pretty cool looking corpse who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers but he doesnt even learn to stand until the final five minutes why couldnt he be the villain instead weve got frat boy joe with a plastic sword ouchbr br charles band you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe i love movies that are so bad theyre good hell i occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad its just bad this one however is just unwatchable a perfect example of making a buck rather than making a quality film
