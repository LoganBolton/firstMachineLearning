the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average middleschool writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didnt have the pleasure to be real picky the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume
