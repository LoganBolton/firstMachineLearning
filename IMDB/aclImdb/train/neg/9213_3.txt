i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my colleges gaming club we were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than deliveredbr br tom hanks plays robbie a young man restarting his college career after resting for a semester what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a roleplaying game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets reacquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaignbr br this movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way i can describe it while im sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know its horribly inaccurate most roleplay sessions are done in welllit rooms usually over some cheetohs and a can of sodabr br the acting while not oscarcaliber isnt gutwrenchingly awful either this is one of tom hankss first roles and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performancesbr br mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a madefortv movie that shows the dangers of gaming worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night
