i didnt even know this was originally a madefortv movie when i saw it but i guessed it through the running time it has the same washedout colors bland characters and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the 80s plus a social platform that practically screams afterschool special anyhoobr br rona jaffes thank you mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons  dragons a penandpaper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america i count myself one of said geeks tho i have never played dd specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren mm was also made in the heyday of dds major controversythat it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality be worshiping satan without knowing blah blah i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point if extremely rarebut it dates this movie horrendouslybr br we meet 4 young college students who play the aptly named mazes and monsters to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life except that mm as presented is more boring than their mundane lives none of the allure of gaming is presented hereand jay jays request to take mm into the real world comes out of nowhere its just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere alsothough at that point we dont really care jay jay robbie kate and daniel are supposed to be differentbut theyre all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really hasbr br but things just continue getting worse in more ways than one the low budget comes dreadfully clear i love the entrance sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns robbiepardu shows why hes not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever and the payoff atop the two towers is unintentionally hilarious tom hanks blubbering jay jay what am i doing here made me laugh for minutes on end definitely the low point in his careerbr br dont look at it as a cogent satire just a laughable piece of 80s tv trash and youll still have a good time that is if you can stay awake the majority is mostly boring but its all worthwhile for pardus breakdown at the end at least tom hanks has gotten better not that he could go much worse from here
