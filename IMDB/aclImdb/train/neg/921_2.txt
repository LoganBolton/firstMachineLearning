i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time she can act but doesnt get a chance in this clunker the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape the production values make blair witch look professional theres a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not amusingly so the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes
