all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes it looks cool it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late60s period and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable once you get that message you may as well switch to another filmbr br daviess protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend one of the few people in his life who cares about him then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real worldinstead of living a fantasy film of which hes the imagined directorhe does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress hes idealized beyond reason a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching herebr br the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzmans fall from mount rushmore in rushmore schwartzmans annoying brattiness was something to be overcome but here its his characters only quality schwartzmans family connection clearly landed him in this role heres hoping his choices improve
