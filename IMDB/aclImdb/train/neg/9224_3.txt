style but no substance not as funny as it should be not as deep as it wants to bebr br this is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking a young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s scifi movie called codenamedragonfly think barbarella or danger diaboliquebr br but jeremy davies is an angstridden filmmaker hes no hack hes an artist the movie he wants to make is a diary of his life hardly originalbr br all the characters outside of jeremy davies filmmaker are as thin as ricepaper characters that might be interesting such as his father his doppelganger or jason schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thingbr br this movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as stardust memories or 8 12 it pales in comparison those movies are funny provocative with welldeveloped characters those movies have lessons that apply outsidebr br the movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene the filmmakers describe it as a sendup but whats the satirical target the actors say its an homage but i think i would rather a fulllength version of codenamedragonflybr br coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the scifi movie within a movie but he fails to share why we should be amusedbr br outside of the scifi movie its just a mess there are continuity errors the filmmaker chooses a scifi weapon after its already been chosen whatbr br just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story lack of a point a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticismsbr br i guess if your roman coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angstridden idealistic filmmaker who doesnt know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing in that sense it may be considered autobiograhicalbr br i would watch it at circuit city on a wall full of tvs if i had a choice watch the 15minute codenamedragonfly movies included on the dvd as extras and then send it back
