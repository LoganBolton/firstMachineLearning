cq is incredibly slow and im a david mamet fan the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very barbarellaesque film after that the movie started to lose me deep and profound not really the movie dragonfly being made in cq has the problem of having no ending this greatly parallels cq which also lacks an ending in my opinionbr br i was lucky enough to catch this movie at the sxsw film festival i had fairly high expectations having just watched y tu mama tambien and several other great movies i was also looking forward to jason schwartzmans performance but it was not an easy film to get into if youre not into 60s scifi or slow movies that go no where skip itbr br cq feels like a student film if you want a recent scifiesque indie film rent donnie darko it wont put you to sleep
