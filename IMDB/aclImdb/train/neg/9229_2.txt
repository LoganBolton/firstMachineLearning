this is a movie about making a movie such movies may be entertaining but they need some substance to do so it did not happen here i am afraid mr coppola did not inherit his fathers skills unfortunately neither did his sister who can however make movies which one might watchbr br i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews br br lets see the lead male actor supposedly a director is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks would that be enoughbr br i regretted every single moment i watched this movie a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie its as if a fran√ßois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheneybr br brazil some other classic sf movies you must be really joking
