i should qualify that title now that i think about it checkout is not entirely worthless ive had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movies expense so i guess its worth something for that and also its worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word not a single original thought went into this movie which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie it is definitely not the next clerks it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done i even heard someone groan in the theater something i had heretofore never witnessed i dont care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance unless youre like me and just cant resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made
