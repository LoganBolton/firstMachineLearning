im among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans but i cant think of a single reason to recommend this moviei dont understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else didif were to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwardsbr br most fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up babyhere the director or writers try to rehash the ideabut it fails miserablyive read comments about how creepy drake wasbut i thought that was far too mild a description franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungovera casting disaster is one thingthis film is a total disasterbr br this one doesnt deserve 10 lines of comments and i dont know why thats a requirementtoo bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaultsbr br unless you want to torture someonegive this one a wide berth
