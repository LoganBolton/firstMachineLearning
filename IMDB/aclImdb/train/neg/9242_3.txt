what a fantastic premise a movie about the berlin airlift it should have it all tragedy suspense comradeship rivals berliner frauleins and tough us pilots love and tears what weve got is a film with none of the above heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so but he fails miserably he acts so wooden that at any given moment he should crack he tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy why would bettina zimmermanns character fall in love with him cause they were throwing stones in a lake cause he brings her coal bricks the sfx are very very well done too much though the hundreds or so planes over berlin look like an attackfighterformationsquadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was interestingly enough the white house the kremlin and general lucius d clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set notice the same drapes hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty by the way general lucius d clay comes across as a small time insecure looser general who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift he was very much the opposite so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion no suspense and no historic accuracy sad it started out so promising
