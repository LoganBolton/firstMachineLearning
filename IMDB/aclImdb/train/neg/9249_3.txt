while watching the film im not sure what direstion it was to take theres a reason a writer shouldnt direct his work and even act in it as well you cant do it all i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats ms mcteer is the film to add to her amazing talents her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged here is a british actress who can do anything in my view conflict is what makes drama and a great story i felt this film didnt have that everything was somewhat easy for the characters there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted watch the film for the sweetness but most of all for ms mcteers brilliant performance
