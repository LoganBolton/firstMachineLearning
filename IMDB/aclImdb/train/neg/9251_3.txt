this movie is despite its independent status a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating motherdaughter relationship it wasnt that bad at first but somewhere during the course of the moviearound the time that the daughter goes out with that guy i thinkit turns into a cheesey motherdaughter bonding movie im sorry but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughterits probably better that way though
