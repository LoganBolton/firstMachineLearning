but the actress playing the daughter just doesnt come across as crediblebr br it doesnt work for me when i see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12yearold other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film that children may sometimes seem more adultlike than adults but with the casting as it is in this film it just doesnt work for mebr br you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about because i couldnt bear watching it to the endbr br i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though  i wish another director would try to pick up this story again
