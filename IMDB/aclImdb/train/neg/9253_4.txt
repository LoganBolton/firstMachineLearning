if i hadnt read his name on the dvd cover i never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave in fact the film is so far from that that i wonder if back in the 50s and 60s new wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of filmits sosounreal and it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films this isnt necessarily a bad thingjust a very surprising thingbr br what i also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this filmespecially when there are so many better french musicals out there the songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical if i had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit i was going to pukebr br the bottom line is that like american musicals not every french musical is gold this film is not another les parapluies de cherbourg umbrellas of cherbourg or huit femmes eight women and despite the presence of audrey tautou i cant see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity
