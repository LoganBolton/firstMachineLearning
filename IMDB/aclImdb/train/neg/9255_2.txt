first i should mention that i really enjoyed ishii katsuhitos previous film samehada otoko to momojiri onna shark skin man and peach hip girl although it owed a debt to tarentinos pulp fiction ishiis cast was up to the task of carrying the story and the entire film crackled with energy the scenes between asano tadanobu and gashuin tatsuya were particularly engaging there was action intrigue bizarre characterizations enough sex to keep things interesting and an utterly unpredictable story linebr br so it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that i began to watch party 7 and my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits which left my wife and i actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were the mix of anime and liveaction work was brilliant then the actual movie started actually it didnt so much start as sort of shuffle in the side door and stand there fumbling through its pockets looking uncomfortablebr br the entire film takes place in three rooms one is a futuristic voyeurs paradise borrowed a bit from shark skin man another is a travel agents office and the third and far the most used is a seedy hotel room in that room a cast of seven characters meets anddoes approximately nothing really im no stranger to talking films one of my alltime favorites is my dinner with andre the talkiest of all talking films my dinner with andre is far more exciting and it just has two middleaged men discussing their lives over dinner the key is that andre gregory and wallace shawn tell interesting stories the cast of party 7 literally just whine at each other for the entire film no you dont yes i do no you really dont yes i really do no you really really dont yes i really you get the idea i hope i wish the directer hadbr br party 7 is an unbelievably unengaging film there is only the flimsiest of plots money stolen from the yakuza just like in shark skin man accompanied by almost no action there is no interesting dialog the characters are largely uninteresting it was as if ishii took the throwaway conversational moments from tarentinos films and built an entire film around them but tarentinos conversations always have their own internal logic and wit they call it a royale with cheese not so with the dialog here which is duller than you can imagine if it werent for the brief hilarious cameo from gashuin who is always marvelous and a lowkey performance from the awesome asano tadanobu i wouldve given party 7 a single star it really was chore to make it all the way through
