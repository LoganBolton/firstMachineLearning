pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other thats it for about 5 minutes we see this its shot in black and white with tons of halfnaked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music it looks interesting but theres no plot and reallythe violence inherent in this got disturbing also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible boring stupid and ocassionally disturbing reallywhat is the point in all this i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence i really wish i could go lower than 1
