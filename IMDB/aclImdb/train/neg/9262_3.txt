on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good its nice to see that the devil child could be a girl in fact sometimes as in the exorcist when girls are possessed or are devilry its very effective but in omen 4 it stunkbr br delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child rather she is a child with issues issues that maybe only a therapist rather then a priest could help she does not look scary or devilish rather she looks sulky and moodybr br this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked but its rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies as a made for tv movie specialbr br on so many levels it lets down its cheap looking the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama the characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not route for them i recently rewatched it after someone brought it for me for christmas and it has dated appallingbr br if your thinking of watching this then i would suggest that you dont watch one of the others or watch the exorcist or watch the good son just dont waste your time on this drivel
