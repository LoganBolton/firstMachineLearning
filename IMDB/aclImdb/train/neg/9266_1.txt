and it did it is through my experience that when a horror film reaches franchise status and subsequent titles are released thereafter they all in turn become stricken by one inevitable factor irrelevance omen iv the awakening makes no exception to this rule featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the antichrist foretold by a religious prophecy havent we seen this before wasnt it enough that over the span of three films prior to this release weve experienced the rise and fall of damien thorn if youre a horror enthusiast such as myself youll realize that its common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy  children of the corn hellraiser phantasm the list goes on at this point in the game im sure you know what to expect when youre prepared to view the fourth title in a series regardless there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are omen iv the awakening is just that too  a shameless money making exercisebr br this film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the omen lineup as unique and genuine as omen iv tries to be compared to its siblings the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike elements like the guardian dog the involvement of a priest the skepticism of the people involved the decapitation death scene clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glasseven right down to the fathers involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable br br although it is common to star a brated cast into a horror title this far into a series the acting is off the charts chockfull of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film the atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles in addition the epic score composed by goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle an absolute joke and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audiowhich really says something because rarely do i comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score  until nowbr br all in all id call omen iv the awakening a failure in the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them some manage to hit the mark and some dont if youre interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as i am for completion purposes perhaps you could carve this title into it as well  if not for entertainment value then to appreciate when a film is executed properly or poorly
