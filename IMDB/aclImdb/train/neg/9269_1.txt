well since seeing parts 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4 everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their mindsbr br i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion but without him around in this one its just not the same sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story lines but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no reason for a part 4 even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sht i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life ill never see again
