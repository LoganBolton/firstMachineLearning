omen iv the awakening starts at the st frances orphanage where husband  wife karen faye grant  gene york michael woods are given a baby girl by sister yvonne megan leitch who they have adopted they name her delia at first things go well but as the years pass  delia asia vieria grows up karen becomes suspicious of her as death  disaster follows her karen is convinced that she is evil itself karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next antichrist  gets a shock when she finds out who delias real father wasbr br originally to be directed by dominique otheningirard who either quit or was sacked  was replaced by jorge montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyones guess as omen iv the awakening is absolutely terrible  a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors the script by brian taggert is hilariously bad im not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that i find even that hard to believe as a serious film omen iv the awakening falls flat on its face  it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof i mean the scene towards the end when the detective comes facetoface with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous gothic song has to be seen to be believed  i thought it was absolutely hilarious  ridiculous in equal measure then theres the pointless difference between this  the other omen films in that this time its a young girl the question i ask here is why seriously why theres no reason at all  isnt used to any effect at all anyway then of course theres the stupid twist at the end which claims delia has been keeping her brothers embryo inside herself  that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of satan worshippers it has been implanted in karen so she can give birth to the antichrist is moronic  comes across as just plain daft at first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than laterbr br its obviously impossible to know how much of omen iv the awakening was directed by girard  montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as its a shabby cheap looking poorly made film which was actually madefortv  it shows with the bland flat  unimaginative cinematography  production design then theres the total lack of scares atmosphere tension  gore which are the main elements that made the previous omen films so effectivebr br the budget must have been pretty low  the film looks like it was the best most stylish thing about omen iv the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping paths but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything i have to mention the music which sounds awful more suited to a comedy  is very inappropriate sounding the acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoysbr br omen iv the awakening is rubbish its a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious  just ends up coming across as stupid the change of directors probably didnt help either thats still not a excuse though the last omen film to date following the original the omen 1976 damien omen ii 1978  the final conflict 1981 all of which are far superior to this
