omen iv 1991 was a bad madefortv movie since the 80s were over i guess the executives were experimenting in meth the drug of choice during the 90s because there is no other reason to explain this travesty why did they even bother making this a tv movie what were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as perhaps they thought it could make it as a series well never know but i know one thing this movie was the major reason why i never bought the omen trilogy they should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this extra discbr br omen iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film instead of a snot nosed punk kid we get the spooky girl whos a total brat to everyone around her if the family had stronger parenting skills then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred these parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline br br not recommended best to avoid at all cost
