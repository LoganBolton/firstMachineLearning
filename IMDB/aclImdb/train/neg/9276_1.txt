this is a truly wretched little film admittedly the original unholy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third the final conflict degenerating into a ridiculous subplot about halfway through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison detre for the omen series but then to foist this jumpedup tv movie beware purchasers of the omen box set on dvd  dont be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer this was and is strictly smallscreen stuff on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable particularly endorsed as it was by the execproducer and producer of the first three movies mace neufeld and harvey bernhard id giveaway the plot if there was any besides the usual death scenes hopelessly toned down for tv sensibilities and some of the worst acting ive seen all involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen let alone masquerading under the omen name if one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess ill feel better for it
