the fact that i watched this entire movie says something about itor me it is not a good movie terrible in fact but terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away it would have made a great mst3k subjectbr br most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here bad dialogue inappropriate music contrived plot sequences ridiculous pseudoscience youll thrill to slomo death sequences the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off but whos shot both look at themselves then the other then themselves then seemingly 15 minutes later one finally goes down youll sing along in latin of course with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly deathschoir that for a moment threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musicalbr br so if you believe like i do that as movies get worse they get better then this might be a decent choice for you its not as funny as my current scifi schlock favorite they live featuring rowdy roddy piper but its more fun to watch than lukewarm movies like omen ii or iiibr br i give it 4 out of 10
