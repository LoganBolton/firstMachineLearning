as with many other popculture franchise series this line just didnt know when to quit instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the markbr br this movie should never have happened it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the samebr br after the wonderful experience which was the omen this was a major disappointment which stank of 70s cheese and horrible acting it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over br br it rates a 1410 frombr br the fiend
