honestly i dont know whats funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board masterpieces review had me in tears thats so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but its a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair good times  this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless youre looking for a good laugh
