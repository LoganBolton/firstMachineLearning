only the antichrist could have been behind such a disaster one only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the film this movie was so bad it forced me to register with imdb finally just so i could trash it what makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such great source material i have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its partsbr br it may seem insignificant but id like to start with the score as the proud owner of a music degree i must register my indignation i was torn between laughter and dry heaves as i listened to what john scheffer did to goldsmiths brilliant score it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes and almost as inadvertently comedic it was by far the most inappropriate score ive heard since well i really cant think of a worse one maybe jaws 4br br as for the plot im sorry new age mysticism what ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy in those films more so in the first two than the third but still the supernatural was for the most part implied and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable here we have crystals going black calling all skeksis and mystics and inverted crucifixes galore even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle gone is the refined psychlogical manipulation tapping the malaise inherent in our collective psyche in its place a boorish slap in the face of recycled cliché and transparent incompetence add to that a lead actress so unbelievably annoying that you fervently thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent never have i seen a little girl so fundamentally irritating since little stephanie ruined all in the familybr br other than that i have no strong feelings on the subject  luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this trainwreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or at the very most a study in how not to make a film viewer beware may induce vomiting if youre lucky
