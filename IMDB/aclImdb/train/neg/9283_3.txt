i dont know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site im a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief but even if i wasnt the poor acting very poor casting sean astin as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the guys completely generic and substandard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance sadly it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe youll like this movie but if youre a vonnegut fan or not completely insane dont see it please
