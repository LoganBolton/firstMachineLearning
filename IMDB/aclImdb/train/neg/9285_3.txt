considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting i grabbed this titlebr br unfortunatly this movie contains more gun battles ala chow yun fat but nowhere near as good than jet li and companys acrobatic fighting thus it was a let downbr br the faucet fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something totaly unexpected in a jet li film for me more on the line of say jackie chanbr br but alas id recommend fist of legend tai chi master or even the enforcer over this dissapointmentbr br rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for overall movie score
