half past dead starring steven seagal in the main role was a major bhit half past dead 2 is just a directtovideo sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something its less entertaining than the first one in all aspects but its although worthy a look if you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session if you also like to watch former wwe stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or notbr br kurupt did a good job bill goldberg was below the average i think he isnt made to the job kurupt is a good comedian i say the rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alrightbr br technical details well a production made by sony cant be great cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable whatever just watch it if you want if you watch you wont lose anything but if you dont well you wont lose either
