for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to twitch in the original movie heres your chance and then get back to the real worldbr br the guy who hid the gold in the first movie told twitch so he gets transferred to another prison where wrestling champs hang around looking broody twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his womanbr br then something happens and someone gets shot and the film turns into die hard in another prison but the wrestlers daughter is caught up in it all so he and twitch go to find her and twitchs womanbr br as you can imagine the acting is below par it features a lot of really annoying rap music and poorly edited fight scenes on the plus side its got that hispanic bloke in it who stars in every prisonactionthriller ever made and he shuts a door in thisbr br its not very eventful but at least its harmlessbr br if you were a massive fan of the original its okayish stuffbr br if not you have been warned
