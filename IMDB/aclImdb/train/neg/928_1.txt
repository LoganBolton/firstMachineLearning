this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe itbr br at first the story is so ridiculousa narrowminded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy filmbr br the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy picturebr br hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline
