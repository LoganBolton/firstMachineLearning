star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning br br long time inmate twitch kurupt gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the reopened alcatraz he claims its to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose there he crosses paths with burke bill goldberg a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself twitch despite being less muscular is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the blacks gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke but the sht really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics cortez robert madrid takes twitchs girlfriend and burkes daughter hostagebr br steven seagal doesnt do sequels reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie so despite this being a dvd sequel the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg steve doesnt even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end but theres a reason he hasnt done much work since universal soldier 2 and thats because hes not much of an actor and not much of an action star either managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull oneliners support wise veterans from the first film kurupt and tony plana have merely jumped at the chance of extra workbr br this is a film thats tried to copy the style of the original quite well with the dim lighting dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it it does this quite well unfortunately it cant contend with an unengaging hero an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along
