first of all i too was expecting another heroa fantastic work of art for the action genre ive only seen parts of crouching tiger hidden dragon but i can imagine that it is better than hofdbr br basic elements from hero are found in hofd great landscapes mesmerizing cinematography and sincere acting i mean if you cant understand a word they are saying without the subtitles but you still carethats good actingbr br what went wrong what begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story worse its a soap operalike love triangle you have three characters who i guess fall in love with each other for no good reasons this movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail i fell asleep about forty minutes into it its almost as if they changed writers at that point the remainder of the movie is about how a character is like the wind ick also you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces this isnt unique to this genre but since the story is weak you cant wait for the action and then when the fighting does breaks out it really wasnt that good the beginning grabs you but then this movie just runs out of gas
