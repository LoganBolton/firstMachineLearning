i was very surprised how bad this movie was nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far i was hoping for a rerun of hero but this is much much worsebr br this movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place no believable characters even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies these characters are ridiculous virtually no plot and ridiculous story twistsbr br this movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child every time you think your silly battle makes some sense they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ah ha you only think youve got me with your super powers and 10000 ray guns but i ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon so your ray guns dont work and im invulnerable to your super powerstap tap no trade backs infinity plus one children can continue with this lunacy because they dont really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time however for the viewer especially the adult viewer this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gasbr br spoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers a if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on pcp in which case your kung fu is not strong b if you repeatedly fall on your back which has a knife in it it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a fake prop c when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife you die especially in ancient china where there isnt a kaiser permanente around the corner d kung fu fights dont last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls and e sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivationsbr br in any event go watch hero again because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible
