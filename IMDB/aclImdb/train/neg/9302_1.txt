this movie is just horrible its boring its low quality the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that its hilariousbr br the main actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls but hes ugly overweight and looks like hes from the early 90sbr br all the characters are away for the weekend for a get together amongst friends but nobody are actually friends the married couple hasnt seen the main guy in over 5 years and even back then they werent really friends the date of the main guy only knows him from work and than theres a girl they pickup at a bar now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a weekend at your cabin with people that arent even your real friends because thats what he does at the beginning of the moviebr br do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon ive made home movies scarier than thisbr br
