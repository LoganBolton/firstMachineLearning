i am writing this review having watched it several months agothe trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie it is a complete jokeand literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre 1974 which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgershell he might not even be good at that either the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldnt even see the actors faces sometimes i dont even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable thats all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents dont do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertainedbr br if you want good quality low budget fun far better than this then check out a jeff hayes filmbecause it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has itbr br i gave this 1 star just for the cover artthats the only thing worth liking abut this so called filmbr br rick blalock
