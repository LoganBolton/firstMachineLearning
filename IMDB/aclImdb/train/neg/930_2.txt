some kids are hiking in the mountains and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator he puts on the gladiators helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikersbr br this thing is just so utterly senseless its maddening heres a short list of things that dont make any sensebr br 1 a guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside the guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent  arriving the next morning he was only 50 feet awaybr br 2 these two dunderheads then hear another girl scream what 100 feet away but dont investigate because theyre afraid theyll get lostbr br 3 another guy and a girl are walking around and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor i mean what the first off thats just a really stupid thing to say secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in togetherbr br 4 a wounded girl attacks demonicus and he stops her telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing um yeah we kinda noticed shes wounded and not dead because shes up and walking around but thanks for that tidbit of informationbr br 5 one girl is tied up in demonicus lair and when someone attempts to free her she instead instructs this person to go and get help um look idiot if she set you free which would take about 5 seconds there would be no need to get helpbr br and it just goes on and on the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods then they fight then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends then they wander around some more its just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through br br none of these characters are sympathetic especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him  he looks like a kid in a halloween costume scrunching his face up to look evil he runs or should i say scampers around like hes gay the special effects are comedic the acting is for the most part awful and nothing makes any sensebr br overall maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue creating characters with actual likable personalities having some sort of logical flow to the action and maybe even making demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit but no instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death
