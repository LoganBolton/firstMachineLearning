the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this movies actors are worst then bens performance in pearl harbor pornos have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80s sitcom shows and in the end itll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house
