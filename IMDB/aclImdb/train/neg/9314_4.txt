welloverall this movie was pretty much worthless and its basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy i just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie this definitely wasnt what we were looking for but it satisfied us for humor the actors in this movie especially brandon are so fake that its funny and especially that tracy girl whenever shes in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away they show almost no emotion and its just so obvious that theyre acting and also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs mark he doesnt even look like hes scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him and seriously would you just be jogging if you were being chased down id be sprinting for my life even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because hes like 300 lbs not to mention that the effects arent that great like whenever the clown chops off susans head in the forest then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with denise and tracy whenever denise throws the head back over also like in the previous guys comment the beginning makes absolutely no sense and i dont even see why it was even included in the movie so what was this movie made in 2003 the music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980s and the cameraing doesnt even really look professional half of the time it seems like the camera cant even stay steady when its suppose to be overall id have to say i enjoyed the movie i wouldnt recommend it though if youre trying to find something to scare you but if youre looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of id recommend it for sure
