this movie was so bad it was terrible it was awful i cannot stress it enough the acting directing story characters and everything about it was bad it was so corny and clich√©d dont be fooled by the cover or the tag line the texas massacre is nothing to laugh at are you frogging kidding me it was ridiculousbr br the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan ok now turn it off what i got from the film was a bunch of ugly annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake waysbr br this movie was a waste of my time and money and it would be a waste of your money and time too i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible i just wanted to see how each bad actor died and it still wasnt worth it just looking at the cover is a waste of time this is seriously the worst movie ever rating doesnt deserve one
