i bought this from blockbuster for 99p the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sht but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a pss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video talking of home videos since when has it been fair game to release them as films  i mean to say films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on  not any more  just gather your friends and lameo ideas together for the weekend lavish the production with an £800 budget and get someone to fall down the stairs with a casio keyboard the soundtrack  then slap it on the shelves for some poor sap me to take home in lonely desperation but heres the clincher  i fast forwarded through most of this and tossed it to one side ready for the hammers until the next night while watching a darren day horror hellbreed £199 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster now this film made grim weekend look like the exorcist so i slapped grim weekend back on to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards that viewers claimed were hilarious sure enough once i had got over the misery the pain and the horror of realising grim weekend was utter chod on toast i could enjoy savour and downright get down to the funny stuff and theres a lot of it check the boards then check the flick hell it might even be worth it awwwww crap
