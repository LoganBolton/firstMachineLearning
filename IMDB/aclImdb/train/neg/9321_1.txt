i rented this movie roughly 45 years ago and was instantly disappointedbr br i wanted to see a bmovie slasher flick but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes the acting was similar to watching grass dry ive seen better acting in a softcore filmbr br the idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me how was this a horror moviebr br this movies production value was laughable at best there were no scares it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas the plot was all over the place if existent if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent skip this one there are much better bmovies out there
