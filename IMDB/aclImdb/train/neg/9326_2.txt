me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs sick is one of the better horrorbutfunny movie weve rented the plot is overdone the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old the goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat and if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to cartoon network for the rest of their life its pathetic the good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie the other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry i dont like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos i dont find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth rentingunless you are too mature to laugh at someones downfalls i would recommend itbr br if your rentingbuying it to laugh at it id give it an 85
