lucky me i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shotintexas horror flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell youive rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of worst killer clown movie ever made from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy im sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one from all indications it was shot on dv and it doesnt really look all that bad qualitywise for digital but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it countsbr br the story slight and cliche as it is goes as follows an executive ken hebert who also scripted and coproduced with the director takes skeptical coworker tracy amanda watson and horny married couple mark and susan hank fields and chris buck along on a weekend getaway to a yawn secluded cabin 12 miles from the nearest town on the way there they pick up a bitchyslutty hitchhiker melissa bale in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanityyackin potsmokin Â‘friends disappears onebyone with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fatesbr br the killer clown doesnt even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being morbidly obese it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes i cannot say enough bad things about the cast especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times doesnt really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense originality intelligence general coherence or humor i could go on for days on how inept this film is how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is but ill just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boythissucks kind of waybr br also noting that the film has been released here in the us as sick serial insane clown killer its currently catalogued under its original title of grim weekendbr br score 1 out of 10
