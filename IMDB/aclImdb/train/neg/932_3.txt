i watched this movie and hoped for something to get better the entire time what is so great about a guy with no emotion yawnbr br you never see alex show emotion for anyone other than his son yeah i know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper if you can call it that i get itbr br characters are undeveloped relationships arent given enough time to be understood in one scene sarah says they wont fall in love and the next time we see her shes talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close logic synapses abound in this filmbr br its like someone watched boogie nights and wrote this part to mimic little bill even the scene where he loses his temper is the same as when little bill shoots his wife down to the facial expression or lack thereof yes william h macy is good at portraying a man without emotion  been there done that  can you say magnoliabr br this movie didnt only lack emotion it lacked substance a good script developed characters and a plot and it certainly lacks my recommendation br br a
