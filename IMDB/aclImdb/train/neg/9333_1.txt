terrible i dont want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkeywhat a disasteri just couldnt believe how bad this movie isthe dialogs are just very strange and off topicthe camera work at times just horriblethe music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabiai just watched this film to see how much worse it can getsome of the side kick actors are total disastersorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film     this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
