the reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist robert james waller also author of bridges of madison county the writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible a failing couplea blocked american writer and a pretty mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong selfdirected criminal and after a few adventures mostly terrifically violent alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of scott glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of giovanna zacarías as luz and not even the stalwart performance of harvey keitel as the cia specialist assigned to track the killer down a serious waste of time
