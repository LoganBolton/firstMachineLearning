poorlymade blaxploitation crimedrama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s pam grier stars in the title role that of a nurse who becomes a onewoman vigilante after drugdealing thugs make coffys little sister a junkie violent nonsense plods along doggedly with canned energy and excitement only griers flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt shes not much of an actress here but she connects with the audience in a primal way not much different from what charles bronson was doing at this time the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable innercity audience today however its merely a footnote in 70s film history and lacks the widerange appeal of other movies in this genre 12 from
