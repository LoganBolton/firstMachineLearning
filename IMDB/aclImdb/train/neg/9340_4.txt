what a wasted castbr br this is one of the most disappointing films ive seenbr br usually roger ebert does not let me down but i feel cheated after seeing this moviebr br the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her bra that is a sorry statement about this movie it held so much promise but it was like dry humping a transvestitebr br this is self absorbed tripebr br i cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment
