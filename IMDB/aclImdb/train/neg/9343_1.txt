how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time by the worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because its so bad its goodbr br an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of bandwagon syndromelets bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws wed citebr br the films universal poor quality goes without saying sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesnt allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this films poorness that thats a task not worth pursuingbr br my impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny   and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobsons sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grinchuckle moments all im sure none intentionalspiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad its good no it had just enough i cant believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing morebr br definitely a film to watch with a group of badmovie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that wouldve significantly improved the experience for me so bad its mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey
