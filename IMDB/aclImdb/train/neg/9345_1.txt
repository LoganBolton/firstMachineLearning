i feel like ive been had the con is on dont fall for it after reading glowing reviews the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews i expected solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization an intriguing plot development and poetic moments sadly sixteen years of alcohol doesnt deliver on the critics promises for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration cliché edits and camera anglesbr br sixteen years of alcohol starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland but its straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense  the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voiceovers the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted  the audience doesnt care what happens to them desperate actors do desperate thingslike this movie to make matters worse the homages typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters are either utterly cliché or unconvincing the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the actionbr br for some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying i still watched the whole damn thingbr br i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often intercut with weird and abstract sometimes pointless scenes you dont need a huge budget to make truly moving film so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film half a million is not a little bit of moneyso no excuses sometimes i wonder what the actorsor their agents were thinkingbr br pass on this turkey unless youre masochistic or mindless anywaynot my thingbr br 1510
