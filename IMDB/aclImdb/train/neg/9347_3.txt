this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousbr br a series of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clich√©s comingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is the largest character in this film
