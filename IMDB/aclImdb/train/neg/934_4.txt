macy ullman and sutherland were as great as usual ritter wasnt bad either whats her name was as pretty as usual it could have been a good movie to bad the plot was atrocious it was completely predictable trite and boringbr br from the first 15 minutes the rest of the movie was laid out like a childs paint by numbers routine the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting which was a pitybr br finally too bad the script writer wasnt the victim especially with the precocious lines from the child which were completely unbelievablebr br again its only the acting that prevented a much lower score
