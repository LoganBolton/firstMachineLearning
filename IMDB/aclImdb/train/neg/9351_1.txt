this is only the second time i stopped a videodvd part way throughbr br i was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both shallow clich√©d and stupid and joyless plodding and pretentiousbr br it was like an after school special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him creepy and sad with voiceover narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry and some singing and no really the poor childs sufferingbr br enough already especially when it morphed into a brazen clumsy and insulting clockwork orange ripoff and did i mention the singingbr br this isnt the worst film ive ever seen but certainly the one ive felt least compelled to sit through i dont recommend it to anyone
