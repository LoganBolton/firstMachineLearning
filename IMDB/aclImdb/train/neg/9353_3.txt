i got lured by the title i was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism instead i got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rowdy scotbr br the leading character isnt given much psychological depth unless you are willing to classify cheesy teenlike poetry as psychologybr br it was a shame because the core of the story could have been good with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youthbr br sadly the general idea seems to be more like im the way i am because thats the way i am and the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lowerclass man makes things even worse resorting to the overused cliché of the poète maudit reeks of a quick fix a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart artsy and meaningfulbr br but 16 years of alcohol isnt much smart artsy or meaningful the leading character doesnt evolve at all and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the bluebr br the movie borrows heavily from classics such as a clockwork orange and trainspotting but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness not even for a few secondsbr br jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain
