i have only recently been able to catch up with the films of marilyn miller since they are not shown on tcm in the uki have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20swhat was she really liketo some stars of this era like jolson some of the magic still shines throughbut alas not for millerher dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographedher singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes ruby keeler seem like hepburneven worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deletedso we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appealshe was being paid 500000 for thisso i have only two conclusioneither she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at alli think that the truth is nearer the later than the former
