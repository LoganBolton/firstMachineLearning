users who have rated this movie so highly simply cant have seen enough good films to compare it with have they all been brainwashed i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this moviebr br from the first bu is just a chase film we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another and another and another and another do you see a pattern emerging there is virtually no time wasted on plot character development or boring old realitybr br if you havent see the other two bourne films youre pretty lost if you have  you only wish you were lost  somewhere a long way from a cinemabr br paul greengrasss dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character he runs he jumps he punches he gets blown up he clears tall buildings yada yada yada above all  he survives he survives like a plastic action man survives which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension so he drives off a building so what hell survive yawnbr br theres a girl thrown into the mix because bournes love interest died in a previous incarnation but shes just decor ive seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarletbr br bournes own journey of literal selfdiscovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didnt know from the first movie he was turned into a killing machine big deal he finds out his true identity so what it doesnt have any emotional resonance when it comesbr br the twist ending is telegraphed and weak oh dear the more i think about this film the more i hate it ive already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment id better end now before the slide continuesbr br i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller the bourne ultimatum is neither its a loud tedious series of flashy edits ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence br br the idea that it shows the way to the bond franchise is utter crap casino royale blows it out of the water
