when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not it was not scary at all acting was good plot was horrible the military bid was just plain stupid i think the scifi channel could of done better than this piece of crap the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some doctors throat out if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible one out of 10 max im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didnt expect this beyond loch nes was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the scifi channel is better than this movie
