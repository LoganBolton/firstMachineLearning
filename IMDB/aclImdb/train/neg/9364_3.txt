i couldnt believe that this movie dates from 2007 it had all the looks of a belowaverage seventies horrorflick didnt they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi didnt they know that in the postmillennium the violence in a supposed horror andor scifimovie should at least be a little bit graphic or did i get the purpose wrong was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal bound together in the big cycle of life or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature or something like that it doesnt really matter either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accountsbr br first of all the premise is very improbable if at a given time youre capable of replacing a total eye no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time thats totally unprofessional and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans and make the victim look like a freak by the way i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppylike normal dark eyes couldnt they have waited for such a specimen the story is lame its about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eyetransplants which suddenly makes him feel like the donorwolf or at least thats what i make of it and then hes being chased by some military men especially this last bit is ridiculous i mean i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with nightvision eyesight but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient its beyond me why theyre out to kill him why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient a volunteering soldier maybe and why try to kill everyone else thats involved with poor aaron isnt that a bit steep who the hell are these militaries anyway i hope not the us army or the government they behave like psychopaths walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons raiding private apartments like theyre after some public enemy  1 and displaying during the ultimate showdown in the woods a total lack of discipline like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren panicking and shooting randomly aroundbr br aaron for some unfathomable medical reason feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes why would that be he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves what is this are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donorwolf are situated in its eyeballs and that the recipient of these eyeballs also adopts the wolfs craving for red life meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his allfours like a cat can a wolf even do thatbr br the acting or the lack thereof didnt help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls especially this indian girl she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression vexed and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey there probably had to be at least one lovescene i really sympathized with actor cory monteith who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face but they didnt give him much to go with he has to run around barechested for more than half of the movie which could have been fun to watch but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique monteith really should leave his shirt on his few killings and attacks are hardly shown we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then theres another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest not much for a modern scifi horror the only good acting came from justine bateman and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy fortysomething lady she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions but they made her character a kind of a wimp who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries what a pity that the script didnt make her stand up a bit more br br in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie hardly scary or thrilling with unbelievable goingson a lot of overlong national geographiclike visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes who cares some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments i guess the word superfluous covers it all
