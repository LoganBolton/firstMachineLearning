hybrid starts as water treatment planet security guard aaron scates cory monteith is involved in an accident which leaves him blind luckily it just so happens that brilliant scientist dr andrea hewitt justine bateman who works for olaris has developed an operation to transplant organs from one species to another hewitt decides aaron would be perfect for her first human experiment hewitt  her team transplant the eyes of a wolf into aaron  he miraculously regains his sight brilliant right well no not really since aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of wolves  starts to develop a lust for blood aaron escapes the olaris building  goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go  a full scale search is mounted to capture himbr br directed by yelena lanskaya this is yet another scifi channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way i think it probably started out life as a straight creature feature but ended up as one of the most boring  dull scifi channel films i have seen that doesnt even feature any sort of monster or creature hybrid is awful the script is terrible  i am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to the initial setup is ok with aaron getting wolf eyes but then hybrid ditches the scifi elements  becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on aarons mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some native american woman yep you dont think the scifi channel could make a film about wolves  put loads of rubbish about native american mythology in there as well do you the dynamics of the characters is bizarre aaron is shown as the persecuted hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film  is a fairly unlikable ungrateful  annoying person while dr hewitt is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives aaron back his sight  does nothing but try to help him i mean aaron is given back the gift of sight yet hewitt is the villain also the regular scifi channel staple of us military intervention is present the problem is why do they want aaron so badly he isnt a soldier  while he has wolves eyes to help him see in the dark hes utterly unremarkable the script cant make its mind up whether its all in aarons mind or its real the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked rememeber this was made for telly aaron running through a forest with a pack of wolves set to some horrible music that i think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny there are so many things wrong with hybrid its slower than hell theres virtually no action theres no werewolves  the film goes round in circles trying to get into aarons mind yet its all so ridiculous silly  boring you wont care one bit  theres never any explanation as to why despite just having wolves eyes transplanted aaron starts to develop other wolf sensesbr br as a diabetic i have problems with my eyes hell i have had major surgery on my right eye  i can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be puffed up you wouldnt be able to open it  it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye transplants as soon as aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no swelling or even redness there are no special effects no blood or gore or violence  nothing to excite you in fact now i think about it theres nothing even remotely horror or scifi feeling about this it feels like a drab film of the weekbr br filmed in manitoba in canada the film looks ok but is bland  forgettable the acting is poor from all involved none of whom i have seen before  hopefully never againbr br hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously marketed as some werewolve creature feature but is far from that  most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in stitches
