although this isnt a great film theres something compelling and memorable about it like another commenter on the film i saw this in childhood its been thirty three years since 1952 but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title see it if you have the opportunity youll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades more than any other film this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century progress its engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one furthermore its easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time
