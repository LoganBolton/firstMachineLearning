this lowgrade universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release which is just as well since the end result was not anything particularly special if decently atmospheric at that for starters the plot is pretty weak  even though in a way it anticipates the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood 1973albeit without any of that films campy gusto what we have here in fact is a penniless sculptor martin kosleck  whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat  who upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic alan napiers vitriolic pen one time too many decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river however while contemplating just that action he is anticipated by rondo hattons escaped killer dubbed the creeper and naturally enough saves the poor guys life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude although it is supposedly set in the art circles of new york all we really see at work is kosleck and commercial painter robert lowery who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl joan shawlee over and over in banal poses  how is that for art who conveniently enough is engaged to a rival art critic virginia grey of napiers before long the latter is discovered with his spine broken and lowery is suspected but then investigating detective bill goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of lowerys work i did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be in the meantime kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting hattons uniquely craggy  and recognizable  visage which needless to say attracts the attention of the constantly visiting grey we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly columnmuch to the chagrin of both artist and model bafflingly although the creeper is fully aware of how grey looks thanks to her aforementioned haunting of koslecks fleabitten pad he bumps off shawlee  who had by then become goodwins girl  in lowerys apartment and overhearing kosleck talking to you guessed it grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police sends the slowwitted giant off his deep endeven down to destroying his own nowcompleted stony image curiously enough although this was hattons penultimate film his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet introducing
