this is a typical late universal horror flick its technically comptent if by the numbers with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of rondo hatton a man with a bone disease as the films monster its sad to see this man exploited but he probably made good use of the money they paid him hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing martin koslack is on board as the films mad artist and he is very amusing in this part i for one enjoy seeing koslack in just about anything for some reason the man amuses me the only other part of the film that entertained me is the films absurd take on the art world here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists this is side by side with the films male hero who is an artist who paintsget thispin up girls somehow our heros work is reviewed side by side with the villans absurdist sculpture also amusing is the films chief nasty critic who at one point claims that he despises the heros pin up art because women like that dont exist to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesnt get out enough finally theres a bit of a subplot about the heroines who is an art critic herself domestication by the leading mancompletely antifeminist and ridiculous to witness overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements
