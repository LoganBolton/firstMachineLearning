the peculiar charisma of martin kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist he imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism making the sculptor marcel a convincing individual the character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical b movie villainbr br the story line is nothing to write home about and many scenes are dull what makes it work is the strange chemistry between kosleck and rondo hatton as the creeper koslecks talkative philosophical character is contrasted with hattons low key monosyllabic approach the character of the creeper isnt developed much beyond a basic monster level but hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back storybr br this movie was on shock theater a lot when i was a kid so i have a certain nostalgic fondness for it its worth seeing once anyway for those who enjoy forties horror movies
