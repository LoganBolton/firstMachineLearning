how sheeplike the movie going public so often proves to be as soon as a few critics say something new is good ie  shakecam everyone jumps on the bandwagon as if they are devoid of independent thought this was not a good movie it was a dreadful movie 1 plot  what plot bourne was chased from here to there from beginning to end thats the plot dont look for anything deeper than this 2 cinematography  do me a favor any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job i am not exaggerating here this film is a tourdeforce of astonishingly amateurish camerawork the ridiculous shaking of every i really do mean every scene will cause dizziness and nausea 3 believable  oh yes definitely this is a masterpiece of credibility i loved scenes about bourne being chased by local police through the winding market streets of tangier  ive been to tangier even the guides cant navigate their way through those streets but bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples 4 editing  i dont know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some  every scene is between 05 and 2 seconds i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the scenes flashing by 5 directing  hmmm this is an interesting aspect the film appears to have actually not had any directing more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script all two pages at the cameramen and told to shoot a few scenes whilst drunk  dont worry boys well tie the scenes together in the editing room the editor should be tarred feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 not one but two senior cia operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood jason bourne  putting their lives on the line for someone they couldnt even be sure wasnt a traitor talk about stupid nincompoops whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paperclip on the floor well all men are evil arent they  except for snags of course yes this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity 7 when the youknowwhat finally hits the fan good triumphs over evil just like it always does eh and the wouldbe assassin gets the drop on jason bourne  he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger yeah  right  at that very moment the evil deputy director just happens to turn up  gun in hand and he does pull the trigger  how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath wonders will never cease 8 dont worry theres a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts well we cant have nasty politically incorrect cia operatives going round shooting people can we how lovely to see a true to life pc film of the noughties the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish
