mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of french society in a life without meaning purpose or directionbr br i watched this because of all the stellar reviews but im afraid i must have missed something the character of mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people getting high and contributing nothing to anyones life shes not interesting or exciting shes just uselessbr br ive seen and known enough people like that there is no secret meaning to what theyre doing they are just lazy bums i wouldnt want mona anywhere near me as she tends to steal anything that isnt nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch sure shes enigmatic  because there isnt anything to her lots of junkies winos and bums ive seen are enigmatic i wouldnt want to see a film about them eitherbr br possibly there is something there that i totally missed otherwise im assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a french female director is high art
