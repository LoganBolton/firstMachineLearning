very bad movieand i mean very badthe plot is predictable and its eally cheesy the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didnt give the movie a one other than thatthis is def a movie one can def afford not to watchi feel while watching the movie the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of clich√©bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasnt so cheesy very poorly portrayed from idea to screen i think the plot is somewhat predictable at times tho the dancing i can say at times is pretty good the break dance battle twist was goodif u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5lol
