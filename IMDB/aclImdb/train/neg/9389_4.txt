according to imdb as well as to every other website that holds a review this thing doesnt have a director well that would surely explain a lot just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultrathin storyline about devilworshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium hardgore is a prime example of totally demented 70s smut as its really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70s and pornography as well so why not combine the two here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl whos committed to a mental asylum and from the first night already shes drawn into a network of drugs psychedelic orgies rape torture and dildoaction really a lot of dildoaction the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her but she has her throat slit even the same night the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated going from laughably unscary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish but what do you expect from a film that features footage of spermfiring dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body but most of her costars male  female are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls
