oh man how low serials had fallen as by 1952 this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie wilkes from misery not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that werent there in the previous chapter and that couldnt possibly be there  tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldnt see the characters jump but i think this serial has the worlds record of stock footage i mean most of it is stock footage and not just from another serials apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men and the cool molten rocks scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from adventures of captain marvel but from itself the whole trip to the moon sequence which is probably the shortest ever its 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave earths atmosphere from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8 and episode 10 is all scenes from previous episodes ever wondered why mst3k never did episodes 10 11 and 12 well they had to stop after 9 so they didnt have to do the whole thing againbr br dont get me started on the science factor prepare to see the sunniest moon ever and moon men that can not breathe on their own world what were they smoking br br and if this is not enough its too talky and the stunts usually the best thing in serials are few and far visuallywise am i the only one who thinks that commando codys bulletshaped or is it lemonshaped helmet is totally ridiculouslooking the rocketeers was way cooler no matter how bad that movie was and man was it awful the tanklike vehicle isnt much better it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk hey everybody has the right to be an hero but then hes so unappealingbr br not even worth watching for nostalgias sake see captain marvel instead 210br br btw check out the memorable quotes section for a real womens lib pearl
