i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too muchbr br why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i dont want to knock burt or adam for the way they look nowits been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the exstars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupidbr br as for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion id like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an exsmoker that was it on those 2br br id love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwomans or 3 mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in itbr br very disappointing and really corny
