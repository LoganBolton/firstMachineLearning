a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo both zombie related but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her toobr br the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact i must confess so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage and there was a lot of that believe me it runs for just 69 minutes and there is still tons of filler you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups plenty of dull kissykissy scenes between goofy teens that rhymed tee hee and some fine examples of why some people should never become actorsbr br as for the title characters they barely even have a footnote in the film why you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature though considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are amongst other delights maybe thats a blessing in disguisebr br and to top it all off it looks likes its been filmed on someones mobile phone for broadcast on youtube jerky camerawork scratches on the print flickering lights i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 and not 1971 even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of datebr br if you think im not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film then go ahead you try sitting through it i betcha you wont even make it to the first appearance of the bluesmartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it and honestly youll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror in fact dont for surprised if it packs its bags and leaves in the morning leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life you have been warned 010br br ps what kind of 18rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene see the movie cant even get that part right
