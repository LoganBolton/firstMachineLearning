i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen im embarrassed to be from melbourne where the film was made diabolical acting amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack as for the plot well thats even more stupid some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was theres a reason they put these types of films on late night tv  because theyre utter rubbish avoid at all costs
