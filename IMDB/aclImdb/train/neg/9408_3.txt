watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 19941997 spiderman cartoons made me realize why i couldnt stomach it when it first came outbr br im from the old school where the 1967 spiderman cartoon was the best and still remains the best i wont get into the psychedelic version which is terrible  give me traditional villains pleasebr br the acting in the new stuff is lousy read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting paul soles where are you now this guy was the best at voice acting for spiderman no one comes close watching secret wars a great idea for a cartoon miniseries made me wince dr doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi in a scene with red skull and doc ock red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid paul frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them ever hear mel blancs son no way can he replicate his dadbr br the animation is clunky okay so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic i really dont think any of these animators know what in betweeners are br br the stories are badly written and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible why for example when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other in secret wars it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement i can see if the hero was dark unknown and mysterious  like the punisher but why the thing and iron man cant hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous then the torch joins in this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because everyone wants to see that stuff give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off but hey what are you doing here and you dont tell me what to do are lame reasons another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peters wedding that whole scenario was awfulbr br last but certainly not least is what another critic calls juvenile violence  meaning no punches at all in secret wars the lizard carefully ducked the things charge but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons sure these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 thats why they cant have punching because mommy and daddy dont believe in that type of violence but you can blow things up these cartoons will include that as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other whats wrong with a punch to the chops is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff theyve written out the punch because we could all hurt ourselvesbr br kids enjoy these cartoons all you want ive seen enoughbr br 310 rating
