i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that spidey dont punch anyone but only for that the show doesnt suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like xmen the punisher daredevil and iron man to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it best spidey show ever my favorite episodes are 1 turning point 2 spider wars 3 the hobgoblin 4 the alien costume 5 mutant agendabr br but there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i dont like morbius and hydro man first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i dont like vampires and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season 2 of course i have to mentioned hydro man he was terrible i rather see sandman his last appearance was so terrible and i dont like spidey as the manspiderbr br but i guess everything than this was bad
