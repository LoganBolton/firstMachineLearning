this film was screen as part of the 2007 sydney mardi gras film festival i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for mebr br i actually like films that take time to develop films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow stillness is good but this film though was just plain slowbr br credit must go to the two main actors there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people misfits really come together in a very awkward way there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about thembr br i also liked the setting and the way it was shot it was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the films intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the charactersbr br i just dont understand the ending what was the point of it all
