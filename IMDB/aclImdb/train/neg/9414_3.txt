despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the grunt but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking thats all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous its not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world war ii films twelve oclock high has very little action but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension the exception to the story of gi joe is a brief battle segment titled city under siege on the dvd which takes place in italy admittedly it is one of the most fastpaced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie but alas the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight another turnoff is pvt dondaro played by wally cassell who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a pervert by contrast sgt warnicki is a sympathetic if flawed man as he says to capt walker mitchum when volunteering for another patrol every step forward is a step closer to home but that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink too bad the rest of the movie doesnt do justice to some otherwise fine touches as for merediths portrayal of pyle it is practically comatose
