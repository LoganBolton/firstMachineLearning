steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen cant save this turkey of a film shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st louisbr br mcqueens a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang theres more than a broad hint that theres a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke hes not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume br br steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions arousedbr br the great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didnt do much of anything one of those two jokers decided steves performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation br br this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen im willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i cant believe they would have if they saw thisbr br or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey
