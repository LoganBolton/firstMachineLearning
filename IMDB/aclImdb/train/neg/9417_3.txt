when the remake of when a stranger calls was out obviously i was interested in watching the original then when i read about the original which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day i saw that the real money is on black christmas which apparently beat everyone to the the caller is in the house punch so i netflix that and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its very long wait all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it then one day out of the blue it finally arrives and its a total snorebr br sure maybe i had elevated expectations but i dont think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh the thing is its christmas in some canadian college town and theres this sorority having a party we see some killerpov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic so we know hes in the house then were introduced to our charactersolivia hussey as the mousy whiny canadianaccented jess margot kidder as the annoying overtly aggressive alcoholic barb shes so annoying even her mother disinvites her for her christmas festivities theres also this irritating janis ian clone phil and this alcoholic den mother mrs mac seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house we also meet jesss highlystrung boyfriend peter played by keir dullea of 2001 and bunny lake is missing fame though halfway through the film i was still asking myself which ones keir dulleabr br so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls but this was before email so they couldnt ask him to send a photo thenwell you know how they say those plastic drycleaning bags are not a toy one of the sisters finds that out the hard way dont worry if you dont catch the first 14 shots of the plasticencased corpse face as it reposes in the attictherell be 28 more interspersed throughout the film obviously there to make you say oh my god theres a corpse in the attic though after the first hour that changes to how come the dumb police havent found the rather prominentlyplaced plasticencased corpse in the attic especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house really any time before csi came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime the cops are so dumb fortunately some of them look like john saxonbr br anyway after a lot more darn boring human drama the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavylooking trap door that rests atop it those wily cats for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble now we have two corpses up in the attichey why dont we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the atticbr br so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously and tap the houses phone and station a cop outside they inform jess and her pal janis ian that if the obscene caller calls back they need to keep him on the phone jessica who has grown even more whiny mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller who is this what do you want who are you after like the first 89 calls when it is clear that he is not going to answer her isnt that like a sign a developmental disability the inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something and whats he going to do suddenly say oh yeah hi its bob from the laundromat dumb jessbr br spoilers anyway soon janis ian and lois lane kidder are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces this films idea of gore and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked hello are you being stalked or what then the cops realize that the killer is in the house and call jess and tell her dont ask questions just do as i say walk to the front door and get out so what does moron jess do starts screaming phil barb phil barb hey great idea sister now why dont you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking of course she does and sees her former friends all splashed with ketchup prompting this viewer to scream at the screen have a clue nowbr br now obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place and that it doesnt move to the same pace were used to and seeing a plasticcovered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably was scary back in the day and people werent used to being stalked by psychopaths so they wouldnt think to you know lock the doors or windows and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there you see people were stupid back in the 70s we have to understand that one of the big shocks is that we dont even see our protofinal girl kill the psycho but believe me that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for spoilers end br br  hey check out
