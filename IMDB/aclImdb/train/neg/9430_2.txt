i too was fooled by the packaging i too fell for the gory packaging and the dvd casing that claims grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves though it was inexpensive 699 it wasnt really all that worth it  no scares and very limited gore the ending was very cheesy and didnt deliver the punch it should have i really dont even know how it became a video nasty with how very tame it is the story drags the characters are obvious amateur actorsit doesnt live up to the promise the dvd bonus feature the interviewis very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there the lead actress talks like shes appearing in a shakespearean production its a great laugh
