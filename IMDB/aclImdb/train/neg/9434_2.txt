banned as a video nasty in the uk unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety however the most shocking thing i found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments the bloodletting i could handle the terrible acting shoddy editing awful direction lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to takebr br three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm they are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house the owner of the house a batty old lady and her spinster daughter welcome the girls in allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recuperate however someone doesnt want the girls to leaveever one by one they fall victim to an unseen assailantbr br taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film and that takes some doing unhinged is a truly awful film the music is a total mess it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser and as such it complements the movie perfectly only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save unhinged from getting the lowest possible scorebr br if you are a horror completist and unfortunately i am you will want to see this in order to tick it off the video nasty watchlist but be warnedit is really really bad
