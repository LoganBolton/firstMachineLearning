unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80s slasher trend pretty young girls in peril i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early roadtrip shots you actually think for a second theres going to be quality in the production watching unhinged was like seeing an amateur acting class go through its warmup some of the most awkward badly lit overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose i wondered why they didnt just put the cuecards on camera so the actresses wouldnt have to constantly shift their gaze the two main girls were obviously chosen for their ta factor rather than talent laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill janet penner and virginia settle as the crazycreepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever long pauses weird expressions emphasis on the wrong word its all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films the scenes shift suddenly with long blackouts you could drive a mack truck through cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer but ya know it grew on me i felt sorry for it i wanted to hug it kiss its booboos and make it better the ending doesnt make up for the damage its caused but i grinned anyway i have my own theories regarding the whole banned hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor otherwise pass
