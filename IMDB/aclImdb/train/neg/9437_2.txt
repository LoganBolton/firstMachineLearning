ive never really considered myself much of student when it comes to watching films i watch them form an opinion and thats it but unhinged changed all this this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making ive ever seen every kid who rocks up at university thinking theyre gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled how not to make a film not only is there no story to be had the film makers werent even competent enough to make a film worth watching its been a while since i saw it but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes they are never ending its almost like having your teeth pulled only not as much fun
