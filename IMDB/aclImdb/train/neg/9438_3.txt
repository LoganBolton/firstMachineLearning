ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this didnt even really have one to begin withbr br where to begin the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the housegreat double glazing the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt  pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of directionbr br add a lead actress who cant act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hopebr br given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder dont worryits telegraphed at least ten minutes beforebr br after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of us no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weaponbr br it really is only a movie as they say
