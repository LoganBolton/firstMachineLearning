twist endings can be really cool in a movie its especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes but we just dont pay attention those type of twist endings are the ones that make people think then weve got twists like this film has twists that whether or not you pay attention you have no clue whats going to happen when they reveal this kind of random twist instead of shock its somewhat a dumbfounded reaction this film starts off like its going to be an interesting take on horror but after about 20 minutes its nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twistbr br three young women are going to a concert so they get lost traveling through the woods and hit a tree trunk they end up at some old creepy ladys house who hates men and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion laurel munson strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasherbr br this film is too caught up in its dialogue and its always between only a few characters we have the main three girls the creepy spinster and the old lady and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five to make matters worse they never have anything interesting to say its actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations we want to know whats going on and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothingbr br plot holes are abundant here the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywherewow three miles a two hour or less walk will kill them why didnt they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town did he have a one seater how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay rarely even checking up on each other why did this have to have so many dumb twists maybe the answers are in the boring scriptbr br having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea its not thrilling its not scary and the ending is definitely out there but undoubtedly dumbbr br my rating  12 out of  79 mins r for nudity and violence
