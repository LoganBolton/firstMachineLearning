heres an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase low budget a horrible name our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes molecular reorganization students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies sounds like a resurrection of classic bmovies from the 50s right nope its not an example of high camp fun which is way way off the mark a glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure opposing the horror that should have had 9944 more in the first place bottomofthebarrel entertainment at its best aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic guru the mad monk 1970 the work of an intelligent genius who has a masters degree in film production its an automatic f so rest easy
