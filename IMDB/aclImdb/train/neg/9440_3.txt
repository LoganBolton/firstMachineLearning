unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the 80s keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children dont you know it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about by todays standard unhinged is a tame little fairy talebr br 3 girls are off to a jazz concert and right away you know the body count is going to be quite low they get lost in the woods  wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake its laughable they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs then theres talking talking about why the girls are here and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesnt like it when someone is late and more talking yakkity yak some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls and someones eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcocks psycho i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film that you wonder when the killings are going to start in fact one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods alone looking for the town smart move she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part but just didnt care more talk continues after this as we wait wait and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killedbr br and then theres the twist ending the expected unexpected for some viewers for others a real gotcha quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this i dont care how twisted it is nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it even with the minor impact of the ending the director just didnt have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it it would have made a much better 30 minute  1 hour tv episode on say tales from the darksidebr br if you really must get this for any reason perhaps just to say youve watched every slasher movie do yourself a favor and have the fastforward button ready since the movie has so many unimportant scenes just zoom through them and in no time youll get to the wow thats what it was all this time ending oh and halfway through the movie theres a shower scene with 2 girls showing boobees horray for boobees those beautiful buzzing honeymaking boobees
