theres only one thing im going to say about cat in the hatas a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucksi lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but werent exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoyingas for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway im not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying dont see itit belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so unkiddy its funny
