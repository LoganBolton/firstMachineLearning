an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful childrens book crude and inappropriate humor some scary parts and a sickening side story about the moms boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book 38 yr olds dont waste your money your time or your good judgement
