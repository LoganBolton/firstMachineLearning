spend your time any other way even housework is better than this movie the jokes arent funny the fun rhymes that are dr seus arent there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids 416 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net my wife left and did dishes so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isnt funny isnt cute the cats makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label
