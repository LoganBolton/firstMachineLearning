just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example hes reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasnt changed since his snl days over ten years ago hes doing the same cutesy streamofconsciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard hes some weird type a comedian not the cool cat hes supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly  and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cutouts for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent theres even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton  that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks its not even an interesting train wreck i hope theyll make horton hears a who with robin williams then well have the badseuss moviestarringspasitc comedian trilogy
