if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all it has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but its not instead its the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects for example the devil costume which by the way is a mustsee is something of the most hilarious ive ever seen whenever i saw that redblack so called monster on screen i couldnt hold my laugh back and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyorbeltbr br do not do the same mistake as i did checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking well its worth a shot cant be that badbr br yes it couldbr br im not even going to waste more words on this movie
