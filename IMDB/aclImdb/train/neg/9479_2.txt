this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being the cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasnt too stiff but then about twenty minutes in theres this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor  and it just goes south from therebr br on top of that the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzillalooking thing in curse of the demon theres also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logans runbr br in the end the cinematography couldnt save this movie despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesnt go anywhere i think hellbored would have been a better title for this
