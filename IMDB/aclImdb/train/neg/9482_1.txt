dont even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me i dont know why theres a minimum of 10 lines ive already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending feh i think the cinematography was the only thing that didnt totally suck well maybe the sound was minimalistically ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so youall take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too
