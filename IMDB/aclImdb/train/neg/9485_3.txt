because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot id like to mention a few points about this film there may be spoilers here i dont care enough to filter them outbr br  given the films low budget the creature design was quite good its actually nice to see a directtovideo horror film thats not slathered with awful cgi unfortunately the digital film qualitys quite grainy in places and its most noticeable in the welllit white halls of the asylumbr br  ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established asis it merely seems amateurishbr br  plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists nor of the fact that some kind of lame eviltrumpsgood development would surface at the endbr br  this may seem like quibbling but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense first of all regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrestinduced why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies why wasnt a plot point made of these impressive qualifications or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion whats the background whats supposed to make us care about anyone in this and just as importantly who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency this film didnt even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubtbr br bottom line see the wicker man instead
