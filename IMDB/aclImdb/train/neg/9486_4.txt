hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named james bishop matt stasi takes up his residency at st andrews insane asylum or mental illness facility as they like to call it there with nearly 600 patients bishop meets his boss dr mccort bruce payne  is put to work he gets ward a where some seriously deranged  dangerous patients are held if that wasnt bad enough during his first round of visits bishop finds a dead body  has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goingson at the asylum  soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about thembr br known as asylum of the damned in the us this supernatural horror film was directed by philip j jones  i sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it the script by matt mccombs takes itself pretty seriously  i quite liked the basic idea behind  some of its ideas but there are a few things which work against it for a start the film is just too slow the story is pretty good  doesnt give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going  i was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute i also thought the socalled twist ending was far too predictable  the ending itself far too bland  forgettable its a shame because i liked the story the characters the setting  some of the ideas but its simply too slow  frankly dull to keep one entertained over its 90 minute duration its one of those films which i would like to recommend but in all honesty i cantbr br director jones does a good job this is actually a well lit  quite atmospheric film i wouldnt say theres anything scary here im not sure if hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasnt they did a great job on the sets  the film looks pretty good overall unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action there are two handprint shaped wounds  a severed tongue  thats it absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment depending on who you believe  which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror i was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive  is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible cgi computer graphic although its an impressive suit it all depends on your expectations i supposebr br technically the film is good it looks nice enough  the lack of cgi computer effects is something i welcome the acting isnt great though it certainly could have been betterbr br hellborn is a film that disappointed me there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good i sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience id find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone
