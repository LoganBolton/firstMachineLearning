the cast although nothing special all do an ok job the story seems like a good idea the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist so whats wrong with itbr br for a start the special effects are really bad if this was made in the 60s it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly from the special effects creator of jeepers creepersbr br secondly the direction is weak this film just does not capture the essence of the story a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil or demon type creature should be tense or frightening it simply isntbr br all in all this is a pretty poor film and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining it is still probably best left alonebr br a rather sad 410
