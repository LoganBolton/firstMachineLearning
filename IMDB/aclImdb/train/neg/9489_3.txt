in theory films should be a form of entertainment while this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of filmmaking most movies specially genre films must not only tell its story or message they must entertain their target audience in some way all this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or lowbudget a bad movie is one that is boringbr br hellborn or asylum of the damned as is known in the us is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving and irremediably boring and tiresome while it has a very good premise it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesnt make things better on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic bmovie but here it is just a bad attempt at filmmakingbr br director philip j jones tells the tale of james bishop matt stasi a young psychiatry resident who just got his dream job at st andrew mental hospital but the old asylum seems to hide a secret after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices james decides to find out what is going on only to find the incredulity of his boss dr mccort bruce payne who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patientsbr br while the premise is quite interesting the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired in an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every cliché of the genre of course there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichés but in hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving resulting in a boring and predictable storylinebr br the acting is quite mediocre for the most part with one big exception bruce payne gives a topnotch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting matt stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performancesbr br despite all this flaws one thing has to be written about hellborn it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day bigbudget hollywod horror productions also the makeup and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good sadly the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated making a huge contrast with the makeup  prostheticsbr br hellborn is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results hardcore horror or bmovie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience 310
