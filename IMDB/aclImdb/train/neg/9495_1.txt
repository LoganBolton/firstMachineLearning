this is a terrible film and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion the characters are uninflected obviously drawn predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish fulfillmentbr br william holden so sad to see him in this role was 55 when this film was made but hes playing someone in his early 40s and looks like hes in his 60s kay lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive i think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connectionbr br holdens characterthe same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film not coincidentallyis placed with obvious trappings of 60s prehippie cool the bachelor pad the swinging hifi the lunches at yamashiro but the film is ridiculously uncool a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big honkin cars sexybr br ugh youth culture was never that desperate and i shudder to think that bill holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part
