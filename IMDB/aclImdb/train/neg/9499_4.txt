i thought the movie was a poor documentary nothing of substance was discussed it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science most scientists appeared stereotyped and sometimes weird a woman said that her awards didnt matter a whole lot only children that were helped she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards playing humble scientist are we i have equations dancing in my head another said i dont see how that explains anything to us it hasnt covered significant effects of science on our culture politics of science were barely touchedbr br not a bad flick for a 1014 yearolds other than that i felt it was boring and unrevealingbr br 410
