im not going to criticize the movie there isnt that much to talk about it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time clyde beatty isnt exactly a matin√©e idol hes a little slight and not particularly good looking but thats ok hes the man in that lion cage we know that when he cant take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day someone said earlier that it is a history lesson the scenes at the circus are of another day especially the kids who hang around i didnt realize that even back in the thirties they sailed on three masted schooners it looked like something out of 1860 i guess thats the stock footage they had no wonder the thing got wrecked theyre always talking about fixing her up theres even a dirigible it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time a kind of giggly silliness but if you dont take it too seriously you can have fun watching it
