sugar spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails  when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie ive heard that the dvd has a directors cut maybe ill check it out but this pg13 trash movie is s and the worst kind of s maybe if the film had some ta that wouldve have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film
