please spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a farrelly or a coen brother plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creekbrand teen angst complete with a genxyz soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie feel cool and we have intensely and painfully inept satirebr br this isnt even watereddown ferris buellerid rather watch a traffic light changebr br only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission when the betty masked girls meet a richard nixon masked friend its a surreal moment priceless evenbr br but for the rest of it id rather have a toothache at least i can apply some benzocainetm to stop the pain
