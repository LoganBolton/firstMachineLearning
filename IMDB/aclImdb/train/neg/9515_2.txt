ok i have watched the original french version but i cant imagine this being better with subtitlesbr br all i have to say that this is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film thats why i cant understand all the positive reviews it might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untoldbr br i usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie tarkovskys solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example but in this case the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters none of which i could identify with or care for in a lot of the scenes i found myself thinking when are they going to shut up the acting was pretty bad not in an overacting obvious kind of way but it seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes this might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical going from one scene to the next it seems this movie was just written badly but never directedbr br this is one of the few films that i can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes no suspense no fear no anticipation no sorrow no introspection no intellectual stimulation no interest what so everbr br a perfect example of what i call an antimovie
