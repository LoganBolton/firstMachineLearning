but i doubt many were running to see this movie or some came running out of the cinema okay thats a bit harshbr br the film starts in an unintentionally comical way frankieboy comes back to his hometown after many years this already smells of clichés and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about everyone wants to talk to him and every woman he meets flirts with him like theres no tomorrow  even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankieboy a little longer even his pretty niece wants a piece of him sounds like one of those laughable mike hammer episodes where every single female wants stacey keach and like stacey keach frankieboy is anything but a goodlooking womans wet dream in real life someone like sinatra without the fame wouldnt get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as maclaine but in this hollywood movie its the other way around maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankieboy but he couldnt care less sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies and it is rarely credible dean martin is kind of miscast he isnt miscast as a cardplayer but rather because of the accent which simply doesnt suit him maclaine is charming as ever but she plays a caricature  and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seenitallbefore movies and cheap novels frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldnt care less about his writing which predictably eventually garners recognition martin is a sleazy but friendly cardplayer maclaine is the dumb but very likable bimbo frankies blond loveinterest is a snotty literary expert frankies brother is the successful guy who married into his wifes business and has a lousy marriage and so on clichésbr br the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too farfetched for my taste frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time and then there is the awful stupid endingbr br in it a drunk guy bent on killing frankieboy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places the place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos  plus its happening in the evening  and yet the guy somehow finds frankie in spite of being drunk as a doorknob and shoots at him but guess who he kills maclaine she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie a cliché which comicbook writers might cringe at this utterly pathetic overdramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semiintelligent viewer and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life  how else is the writing of this movie to be explained there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie  martin vs some cliché caricatures out of the writers vivid imagination it was like a damn western suddenly another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snottynosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too lowclass for her there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latters character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clichéd silly confused pretentious and primitive at least maclaines character knows that she maclaine is dumb there is another irony that i didnt fail to notice sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story  much like the writer of this movie and thats why he came up with the corny crappy finalebr br the film basically has a solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on realitybased characters and eventsbr br if youre interested in reading my biographies of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by email
