there is a lot of talk of torture these days thats all this movie is its about a good person who makes a bad decision because of his kindness he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women from then on its a justforkicks assault on him i dont know at what point you do something about it there is a wife and child out there somewhere he has great feelings of guilt and fear but there should have been some times when he could have acted the movie seems to be somebodys joke i suppose in the wake of the manson murders we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two nevertheless why would someone make a film like this what appeals does it have except for sadism the conclusion is totally unsatisfying but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist oh well another hour and a half of my life
