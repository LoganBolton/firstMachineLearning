so this guy named george is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up georges wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away george gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls it isnt that great of a scene because it really doesnt show anything after that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house they make him a nice breakfast but george isnt hungry george isnt very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house the girls have had enough with old george and no longer want to cook for them they both turn out to be major psychopaths and use george in their little crazy game i liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up georges house george wasnt really that great to his two guests when george said he was a married man he really didnt seem to mean it george looked like tom tucker on family guy i was for the two girls the whole time
