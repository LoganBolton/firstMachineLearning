best of the best 4 is better than 3 but just barely basically i say this because part 4 doesnt contradict parts 12 like 3 does ie their is no reference to tommy lee having siblingsbr br anyway i liked the russian plot line of the story and especially sven olethorsens bit part as boris aside from that though and a few fighting scenes the movie is nothing special the limited budget is also very noticeable especially in the airplane blowup scenebr br also part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did there are a couple of more better known actors hudson thorsen in part 4 but alas nothing like the beginning of the series and even these characters have very small rolesbr br alas it seems best of the best is the rhee show and to be truthful he cannot carry a moviebr br saw on tape rating4
