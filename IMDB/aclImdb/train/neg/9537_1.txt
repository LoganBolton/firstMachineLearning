spoilers i rented tesis or thesis in english on the strength of director alejandro amenabars later effort the others based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror instead i wound up with the most tedious preposterous excuse for a lamebrained slasher movie ive seen since the german film anatomie which this one kinda reminded me ofbr br the plot has potential but its thrown away within the first 20 minutes it revolves around innocentnpretty psychology student angelas ana torrent  a jessica harper deadringer thesis on the subject of violence in films through some farfetched circumstances too dumb to go into here she winds up in possession of a snuff tape on which two men torture mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera angela and her horrorbuff friend chema fele martinez are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of whos responsible for itbr br this leads to well nothingbr br they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girls killers since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls there is only one proper clue the type of camera the killers used is discovered and thats a a really weak one and b wheeled out in the first 20 minutes the rest of the socalled unravelling just occurs through blind luck increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running timebr br seriously  amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but hes clearly never read a detective book in his life the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist in tesis potential spoiler ahead the killers identity is guessed correctly by the amateur detectives almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas throws his hands up and says ok ya got me it was him after all as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes  no such luck youre watching the wrong movie if thats what youre afterbr br the only thing that drags tesis down further from just being a dumb badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous muddledup point about violence in films i have no idea what stance its attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided confused psychobabble in between the rest of the gibberish and say look at me im political the final scenes in which the point of the movie is supposedly hammered home are so utterly absurd and puerile one cant help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this if he doesnt he certainly should this is total amateur night at the slasher house stuffbr br overall i cant believe i wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this just hoping something might happen the urban legend of snuff films and that is basically all they are despite the way this film tries to suggest theyre some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films videodrome anyone but its so easy to step over the line into childlike wouldnt it be cool if territory with it ie my little eye tesis hits an alltime low for the snuff movie genre on every level this one is better left dead and buried ill award it a 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting but thats all its getting
