when i saw the commercial for this i was all about seeing it now forgive me but its been so long since ive seen it that i dont recall how it went suffice it to say the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the movie they sold me onbr br i was bored annoyed and incredibly disappointed by this movie and if it wasnt bad enough they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music not exactly moodsetting music for a horror movie eh mon i guess if you never saw the commercial or trailer i suppose you may think this is some hot stuff for my money the commercial was way better
