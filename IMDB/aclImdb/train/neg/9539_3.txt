a bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an allnight horror movie marathon however as the night goes on theres somebody among them killing them off one by one who is itand why i saw this in a theatre way back in 1991 i was looking forward to itbut boy it did not work at all the premise is a good one they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like dee wallace stone on boardbut it doesnt work the story stops making sense halfway through that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released the killings are relatively bloodless how this got an r rating is beyond me and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupidbr br its really too badthis movie had potential with a better script this could have become a great horror film as it stands though its mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it i heard stone wont talk about this one i give it a 3 and thats just for the cast
