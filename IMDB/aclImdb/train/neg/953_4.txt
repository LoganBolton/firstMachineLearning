happy go lovely has only two things going for it and those two things are veraellens legs this is a british excelsior films version of an mgm musical complete with second tier stars i would imagine that veraellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star but im sorry to say ms ellens chance did not pay offbr br opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin and with the exception of david niven cesar romero who is way over the top in his role of a producer and bobby howes who is totally wasted in a nothing role the rest of the cast is totally forgettablebr br the choreography is boring but ms ellen gives it her all she was never as famous as most of the other musical starsand she shouldnt be since she couldnt sing and even had a dancing stand in in several of her pictures but when she did dance it was just entrancingbr br its too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shinebr br 4 out of 10
