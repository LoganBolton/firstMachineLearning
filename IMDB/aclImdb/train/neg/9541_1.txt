i suppose many people commentreview their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible  im writing due to the latterbr br i was excited for the sequel to wargames  i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content i felt it was worth watching more than once this being 2008 i had high hopes for what they would do with this film computers gaming terror military overzealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film and wargames the dead code had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flickbr br the movie failed on pretty much every level but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects the dead code was a 1990s air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms meanwhile will farmer is button mashing about 7000 commands  none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen until finally he wins by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20000 virtual people nobody is near the gas because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes this tells ripley the real life war machine that he is a high level terror threatbr br even though any 516 year old could complete this same task  the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity they say things like he has expert knowledge of bioterror  he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on bioterror so then a movielong chase scene with about 01 of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter sometimes they are mad they barely miss him but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow himbr br ugh i would write more but i already wasted 15 hours watching this i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tictactoe for 15 hours
