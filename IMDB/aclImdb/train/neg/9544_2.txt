i didnt enjoy this film i thought the acting wasnt very good and the story was boring a 20year old computer saving the day i thought that this was just slightly far fetched even for a film i couldnt figure out why they couldnt just turn it off why not take a sledgehammer to itbr br its a shame but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film it wasnt if that is what you want to watch do not watch this film br br even if the old computer hadnt have turned up to save day this would still in my opinion be a very very cheesy flick
