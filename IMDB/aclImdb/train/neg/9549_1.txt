i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please dont watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgicbr br i didnt like the bending of the plot to beattheterroristthreat idea either in the first film wopr was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the usa in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
