the oddlynamed veraellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie iceskating blonde girlish always delightful to watch but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material when i watch veraellens sexy apache dance with gene kelly in words and music i cant help noticing that her blouse yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag for some reason the very american veraellen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in edinburgh a city not noted for its tapdancers lets be happy and happy go lovelybr br in the latter cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh theres a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival which is nonsense the festival is not a showcase for splashy legshows we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile apart from a few highland accents theres absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning when we learn that the title of romeros show is frolics to you this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks wontbr br veraellen is as usual cute and appealing and an impressive dancer but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad the plot  mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson  is brainless though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals romero is less annoying than usual here probably because for once he isnt required to convince us that hes interested in bedding the heroinebr br the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals his wistful rendition of shes my lovely was a big hit in britain in 1937 here he shows up in several scenes as romeros dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number nor even any real comedy its absolutely criminal that this movie  with a title containing the word lovely sure to evoke howess greatest hit  would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to dobr br the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts whom i worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence and theres a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall as veraellens confidante somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices ive ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go but doesnt match either val guest has a story credit but this movie doesnt come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies the colour photography is wretched though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywoods process work happy go lovely is at utmost best a pleasant timewaster with waster being the operative word ill rate this movie just 4 out of 10
