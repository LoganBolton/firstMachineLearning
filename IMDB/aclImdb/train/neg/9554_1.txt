this is the worst and i mean the worst computers based movie i have ever seen the whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity br br i meanbr br the guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person now you probably think this must be some super cool hightech computer well  it is but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interfacebr br and the main idea how to overload the super computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid my mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer gamesbr br there are also some other bad things about it but i just dont have time for thisbr br i just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
