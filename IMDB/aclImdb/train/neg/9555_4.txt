you have to understand when wargames was released in 1983 it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling real computers were beginning to show up in peoples homes and for the first time society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movies premise excitingly prescient granted a talking computer that balanced its free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it ive probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based onbr br fast forward 25 years and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a sequel called wargames the dead code ill just dig right in first of all the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects youre probably very confused right now the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the subgame within the web site called the dead code where they pilot a plane over a city spraying it with bioweapons at some point in the game you have to choose between sarin gas and anthrax and if you choose sarin then youre automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated in the movie this actually happens however since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious it obviously all makes sensebr br second the avatar of the ai in this straighttodvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the popupadesquire sound bite play with me baby because apparently in the future advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess and gets into pornbr br third the motivation for these hackers is profit and women as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie for some reason recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else that may work for your average sitcom but cmon you dont learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair playing sports and shopping at the mall folks the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie and then later there is the phrase good hunting will i swear they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr damon this will kid isnt bad but he was certainly wasnt like any obsessive hacker ive ever met i cant fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original because it has absolutely nothing in common with it exceptÂ… professor falken and joshua wopr make a reappearance in this movie as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom and a dilapidated old tictactoe machine with a higher pitched voice after some prodding joshua the ai has what appears to be sex with the new ai with the porn voice a bunch of board games flash on the big screens and the whole the only way to win is not to play revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment except that those of us who saw the original you know those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that a recycled ending for a movie made from last months compostbr br the new movie was directed by a guy whos done 90210 and written by guys who do b movies the original was directed by a guy whos been keeping himself busy with heroes so you see the quality difference there there was talk of a real remake but i hope they dont destroy this classic all over again i swear if i have to ill visit every gambling web site until i find the one thats run by a psychotic government computer the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix so at least the only energy i expended watching this disaster was for breathing clicking and indigestion
