ill try to use words to describe this on br br i saw the original which was good in its own way but back then i should have feared a sequelbr br and i was afraid when i picked this one up but now that ive seen it i have to say its even worse then i thought why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin br br lets start with the actorsthey arent all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful but what can an actor do with a script like this one its trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasnt been done before fails miserably in a futile attempt to get it uptodate they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole bigbrother theme  but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the 83 original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad in conclusion if you have nothing  and i mean nothing  to do go watch it or play frisbee with the dvd by yourself itll offer you the same amount of fun i promise
