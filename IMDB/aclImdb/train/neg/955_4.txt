i dont think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm he could act got an oscar for it but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paperbr br happy go lovely is a case in point its a musical and for the most part youll remember veraellens dancing youll remember that they are in scots costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memorybr br the plot is light veraellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh she starts in the chorus and runs late one day she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king everybody now assumes shes the main squeeze of the millionaire doors open up as theyve never opened beforebr br the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musicalbr br in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of
