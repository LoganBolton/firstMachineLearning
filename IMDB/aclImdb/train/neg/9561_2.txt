like many others have commented before me here i have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst ive seen there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because i hate spoilersbr br i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra  to spend on cgi ive seen worse of those all in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have any knowledge about computers andor technology at all there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and i found myself just begging for it all to end  fast  halfway through in addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human beingbr br this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old wargames and i think its a damn shame they even got to call it a sequelbr br two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only the actors performances arent halfbad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with still they should never have signed on to this movie not really a careermove but i guess we all have bills to paybr br to those of you who gave this movie top scoreyou have to be on the studios payroll or something thats my only explanationbr br to all who havent seen this one by all means watch it and make up your own mind but lower your expectations to the floor and then some
