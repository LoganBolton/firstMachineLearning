i think this couldve been a decent movie and some of its parts are ok but in whole its a b movie same about the plot parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesnt quite add up acting is mostly ok ive seen worse of this too br br the beginning sets the level with cars driving in the desert making cool but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes in slow motion cool like the drivers had never seen sand before it gets slightly better from there but not muchbr br if youre gonna rent this get another one too and use this one as a warmup keep expectations low and it might work for you
