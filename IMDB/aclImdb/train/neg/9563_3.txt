this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80s hit  its set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a uav right at the startbr br and thats exactly where the movie jumps the shark uavs arent armed they could be but i dont think its ever been tried for real we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation called ripley we are introduced to hacker will farmer hes good at chemistry  electronics which doesnt make him a computer hacker  his love interest annie  wills 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical companybr br wills taking money from his neighbours bank account mr massude isnt a hack he helped him set up the account we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war  they play the dead code the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massudes pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against willbr br exactly why ripley shut wills machine down isnt explained hes only playing an online game  also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable as for ripley activating his mobile phone i think not it wasnt connected to the pc and the message wouldnt play unless he actually answered the phone so theres more bad hacking science there toobr br ripley agents arrive at massudes home take him away  will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isnt a hack as you never see him break into the dmv computer the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as hes looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him wills mother hadnt been stealing chemicals  bio agents either and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis patriot act or notbr br i dont know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the usbr br the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will his mother  dennis wasnt sanctioned by a government agency the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful systembr br the guy who ran into annie at the airport  was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley  the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lipsbr br another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced the joshua project we discover that the guy who ran into annie is falken not played by the original actor sadly who faked his own deathbr br we also get to see wopr as whats going to help them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then falken  wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill will annie  the russian its also unlikely theyd create a selfcontained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out ofbr br the whole decontamination plot  idea are totally unbelievable those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff so yet another laughable  unbelievable ideabr br the ip hacks against ripley arent done by will he just contacts one of his friends who suggests  implements the idea its excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripleys operating temperature having joshua as a backdoor into ripley especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible copout and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done withbr br there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown saying 17 minutes then ripley says decontamination in 30 minutes how crap is that when they cant even keep up with their own timer ripleys attack mission against philadelphia is halted far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what shes doing wont work surely shed already know if she had joshua insider her as hed already learnt this lesson in the original movie is yet another nod back to the original moviebr br their copout at having ripley repeat joshuas exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up withbr br if you want to point fingers for bad  stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat  rob kerchner this is an awful movie and is best avoided
