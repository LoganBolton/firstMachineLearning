some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen and i understand where theyre coming from but i really have seen worsebr br that being said the movies that i can recall ie the ones i havent blocked out that were worse than this were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulnessbr br war games the dead code isnt that bad but it comes pretty close yes i was a fan of the original but no i wasnt expecting miracles from this one lets face it the original wasnt really that great of a movie in the first place it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geekappeal to itbr br thats all i was hoping for something bad but that might have tugged at my geekstrings was that too much to ask for is it really not possible to do better than the original war games even for a straight to video release well apparently that was too much to ask for stay away from this movie at first its just bad like oh yeah this is bad but im kind of enjoying it maybe the end will be good like in the original and then it just gets worse and worse and by the end trust me you will wish you had not seen this movie
