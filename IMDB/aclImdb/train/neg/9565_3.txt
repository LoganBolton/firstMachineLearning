i cant say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie ive ever seen as it had one or two decent moments but i can easily say its the most transparent movie ive ever seen not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 minutes in advance there was no subtlety to anything the movie did no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes every spoken or typed lines intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to get into the moviebr br i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie
