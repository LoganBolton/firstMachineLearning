i see a lot of movies saw the original wargames years ago and loved it computers where still a big mystery for the most of us and the movie was convincing in its own waybr br this one however looks like a low budget wednesday night special total crap from start to finishbr br the plot is so weak you wont believe it until you see the movie which i would not recommend in the first place i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie but hey with that script i wouldve been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting lots of clich√© scenes cgi looks like its taken out of the 86 versionbr br bah no im getting in a bad mood just writing about this do not watch this moviebr br lifes to short to waste it on watching crappy movies
