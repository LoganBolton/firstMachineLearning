its amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seenbr br not only have i ever been this bored before luckily not for more then 15 hours the preadolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted after the first very awkward part you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better you hope in vain it only goes downhill from therebr br the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this nonstory three times one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again
