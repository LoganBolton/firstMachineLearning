for the first time in years ive felt the need to log into imdb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review because it was just such a letdown to watch the plot sounded awesome when i read it i expected a minimal mystery thriller a claustrophobic phantom hunt unfortunately it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane tiring love story and too many contrived and teethgnashingly stupid noonesaysthingslikethisexceptinbadmoviesdialogs that its just agonizingbr br heres a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film br br  the script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that its just laughable no actually its angering and lazybr br  related to that cheap thrills a long parade just in time momentsbr br  the main characters alright it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies thus his characters are boring lifeless second generation clich√©s they are mere plotdevices placeholders without the slightest bit of personality they are man and woman in breakup who still love each other never seen that one before except in 100000 movies and its not getting any more realistic or enjoyable think of the blandest twodimensional hollywood fare and youve got it there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh charming or interestingbr br  the farfetched vague resolution thats swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple though the word resolution might be illfitting here because the movie is a swampy mess that isnt going anywhere anyway by the time youre through though you dont care anymore the last third of the movie i just fastforwarded because it was just so unbearable to watchbr br okay thats it whatever redeeming features this movie has it all gets buried under incompetence dont watch this turd
