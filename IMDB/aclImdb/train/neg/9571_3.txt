someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughoutdemon seed cube the remake of thirteen ghostsbut its at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt its all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central the idea is this an architect has builtactually rebuiltfor himself a huge and rambling house his wife has just left him mainly because of his own selfcenteredness but also it is intimated because she cant get used to the place since he remodeled it living in unaccustomed solitude real this time rather than virtual he comes to suspect that somebody elsea stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappearedis living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees himbr br this is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didnt foresee or doesnt remember the movie would turn into a catandmouse game a hunt a battle and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didnt expect then he would be forced to think himself out of itand maybe at the same time out of his own selfimposed isolationand in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the erbr br nothing like this happens in this movie the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is installed in the houseif he isthe architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing he calls the police they think hes slightly nuts he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks hes more nuts at last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder doesnt get a good look but figures who else could it benot a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key i dont know why he thought this necessary and leaves his victim to starve i missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel in any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place and this is it the architectare you readymoves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his and lives there in the same way how is this possible it is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin their neighbor whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the waybr br if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in the architect takes up residence with martins wheelchairridden wife unbeknownst to her so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that hes able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger who doesnt know hes there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer but at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the catburglar entirely incredible not to go into the series of twists at the endincluding another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible doorthis one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair two nice people who take murder in stride and before the story started the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses to the final longanticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and thenendsbr br here is a story that depends on the development of two thingsthe idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it isand fumbles both the first fumble makes it boring the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnelbuilder and sneaktenant the story should be redone by someone some day
