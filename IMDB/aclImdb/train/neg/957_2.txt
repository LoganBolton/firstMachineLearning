so i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his filmbr br the documentary section at the beginning dragged on yes the kid is a nutjob from no where but thats not good enough to keep it interestingbr br seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight and after about thirty seconds it loses all humorbr br when crispin glover takes on larry the storytelling was better but i just couldnt take anymore
