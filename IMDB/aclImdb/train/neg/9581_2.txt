that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie cleveland is the star ive been there and never saw the city look this good beautiful river and cityscapesbr br this movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you wont notice the lack of real world relevance people running around and shooting guns without any consequence for example there is a shoot out at rob lowes characters house two cars are stolen and yet the cops dont show up there till much later in the movie murder for hire never looked so implausiblebr br whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this i check the date of the movie just to make sure it wasnt written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case this movie is currently in rotation on universals hd channel unless you want to drool of over lowe there is no reason to watch it
