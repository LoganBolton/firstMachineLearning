recreation of 1950s london soho and the upandcoming people based on a cult novelbr br julian temple is a video director no more no less give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video here he forgets that two minutes with people that cant really act is one thing  but two hours what was he thinking of besides who are the audience who cares about a book that was well remembered waybackwhen the usual london story of the chancer taking his chance br br what could really drag this film even further down oh i know third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot david bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight the soundtrack album is clay pigeon materialbr br there is one good thing though good recreation of period soho shame they couldnt think of anything to put in front of it
