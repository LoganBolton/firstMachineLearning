absolute beginners was a film for the younger generation a multitime film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled constantly hitting each note teens problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow it could have been dubbed the moulin rouge of the 80s but it disappeared it made its very shallow mark on the world snuck under the radar and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section the comedy section or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesnt need chain money to survive alas that wasnt where i found it  but i found it watched it tried my hardest to sing along with it stared into bowies eyes but found myself faded by the end did it not survive the test of time is 1950s london too far removed from our current society is bowie too creepy i think absolute beginners falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang but withers to a mere sparkle by the endbr br absolute beginners opens with a huge number that takes us through the nongritty streets of london which involve theft nightly prostitutes on every corner dance throughout booze like rivers and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters the one we follow most is colin played by eddie oconnell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl suzette played by patsy kensit these two have chemistry and while suzette looks like a prerehab lohan to me they worked there was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like lava and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled i was ready  but then something happened temple takes us out of the nightlife takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first suzette runs away colin becomes a pervert and bowie  well  i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  i can tell you that much temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger we learn about colin mainly but nobody else i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era also were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s but maybe it was my tvbr br character development thrown right out the door temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colins parents of which i didnt know it was them until after the film and a song which screams apathy great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands then if that wasnt enough we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going and temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme i didnt think racism would be on the top of the bill suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race somebody help me out here it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off to me the ending of absolute beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number that first part set the pace and temple could not keep upbr br overall i must say that temple can direct a music video but i dont think he was quite prepared for the feature film i dont think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come it is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside i wanted some cutting edge work but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s but by the end it just felt forced i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to motivation by the everfreaky bowie in this film it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status i am glad that i watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning but he couldnt control his characters way too many and the songs didnt seem to match the final moments of the film it came out of nowhere and it was unwelcomed if this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning absolute beginners was a welcomed adventure but i dont think i will be dusting this film off in the futurebr br grade  out of
