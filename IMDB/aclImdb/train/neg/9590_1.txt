the film is based on a genuine 1950s novelbr br journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three london novels absolute beginners city of spades and mr love and justice i have read all three the first two are excellent the last perhaps an experiment that did not come off but mcinness work is highly acclaimed and rightly so this musical is the novelists ultimate nightmare  to see the fruits of ones mind being turned into a glitzy badlyacted soporific onedimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london and does nothing of the sortbr br thank goodness colin mcinnes wasnt alive to witness it
