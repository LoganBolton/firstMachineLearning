judging by some of the comments in imdb i was expecting an action movie  perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one but essentially an action moviebr br whatever it is that i watched it certainly didnt feel like a movie the story is simple and straightforward even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated take three interest groups 1 the government 2 the rebels 3 a group of assassinsbr br now subtract the first they never appear in the movie then simply let one of the assassins the princess become a rogue on a revenge trip add in a rebel loveinterest with a guilty conscience and youve got the ingredientsbr br but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be scifi on a low budget what youre left with is a feeling of emptiness the movie just does not feel like a movie but a weird incoherent boring dreambr br avoidbr br 210
