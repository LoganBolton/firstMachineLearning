as much as i like japanese movies this one didnt just cut it a movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plotbr br the photography is ok though ive seen much better sword fight scenes in other japanese movies the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didnt convince me at all the soundtrack is so weak you dont even notice its presencebut worst of all was the way the plot evolvedi have to admit that at some times i had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going onanyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a hollywood influencebr br all in all if your looking for an action japanese movie this isnt it its very slow with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental in a bad way
