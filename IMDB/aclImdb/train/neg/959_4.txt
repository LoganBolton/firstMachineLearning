i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it werent for ms claudine barrettos performance and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquinos here and endbr br i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that some writers dont give enough attention to the characters and their progression in their stories redundant it was as if they pushed the movie onwards when their storytelling stank and my goodness creative exhaustion led them to ripoff other movies why why did this movie get a good review i wouldnt give it that much merit the movie was kind of scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore it goes into my list of most likely to happen category i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences never mind if the lighting sucked it wouldnt matter much if the content would blow you away sayang
