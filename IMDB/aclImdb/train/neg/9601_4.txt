this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changedbefore telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it as rino di silvestros messy film completely lacks vision and if there is any point to the plot it wasnt put there on purpose werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a so bad its good film but i completely disagree normally i enjoy films like this but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film and despite all the sex and savagery on display it doesnt even make for a fun watch and that really is unforgivable the film really doesnt have much plot but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf she dreams of going out and finding men having sex with them and eventually killing them back in the real world she falls in love but her lover is killed and she goes out for revengebr br the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters but they really dont do that and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic but the gore works well the premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation as theres plenty of naked women and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica but this isnt capitalised on and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines i really cant stand watching films and being bored overall i wouldnt even recommend this film to big exploitation fans theres plenty of better stuff than this out there and while the title may sound intriguing  the film isnt
