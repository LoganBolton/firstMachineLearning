this italian film from the 70s is not even in the class with dog soldiers the howling or even that awful american werewolf in paris butit is fun to watch im talking about watching the lead actress a stunning blonde run amok in her birthday suit were talking about graphic complete nudityits obvious that she is a real blondehumma humma humma the story is a hoot the sfx are childish and the acting for the most part stinks the only redeeming value of this movie is all and there is a lot the nudity  sex scenes tame by hbo standards but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night okheres the spoilerthere is no werewolf except in the opening scene of the heroines ancestor the girl just imagines that shes a werewolfin other words a clinical lycanthrope
