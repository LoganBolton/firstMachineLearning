i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe and i wasnt far off theres a fair amount of glimpsed gore and they threw in lots of nudity but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists holy cow they actually put a little thought into the story and didnt completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and dare i say it some of the gratuitous nudity wasnt so gratuitous after all because it fit in with the story and settingbr br dont get me wrong its still overall a bad movie but as bad movies go its a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster
