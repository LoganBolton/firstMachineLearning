oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a ripoff of japans ringu well i guess the us made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i cant believe this had to happen claudine and kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines you do not have to stoop this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them
