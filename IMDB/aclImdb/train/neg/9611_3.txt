there are so many goofy things about this movie that i cant possibly name but a fewbr br bogarts character 1 his name  whip mccord too easy so ill leave it at that boy it makes humphrey sound good 2 his long curly hair and silly sideburns 3 his black bart getup complete with spurs 4 not sure what shade of lipgloss theyve got him wearing but it aint none too flatteringbr br cagneys character jim kincaid  1 his lipstick doesnt do him any favors either 2 the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film could they not find a hat to fit him even a little 3 his pants are too tight in the rear 4 he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times if you know what i mean and i think you dobr br if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western do yourself a favor and forget that thought even the horses look embarrassed that is when they dont look boredbr br in all fairness i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre but ive still seen much much better than thisbr br on a comedy level or as high camp the oklahoma kid works otherwise its viewer beware therefore see this only if a you must see every western out there b you are a true cagney or bogie completist c any of the above comments appeal to you woah
