it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel the plot was hazy inconsistent and choppy to say the least i dont want to say anything meanspirited about the actors but they cant act dickens is difficult of course but this is pathetic micawber was nothing more than a midnineteenth century kramer and the less said about betsy trotwood the better if you want to see the real copperfield watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation as for the screenplay writeri think he read the cliffs notes
