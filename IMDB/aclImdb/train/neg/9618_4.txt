i have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like friday the 13thi know what you did last summer this movie wasnt that bad in fact it wasnt as bad as most of the horror films hollywood has released recently the killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that original the cast was mediocre which is to be expected from lowbudget features but much better than what that much bigger studio artisanlions gate has been offering my only real complaint that wasnt due to the films budget which must have been small was the contrived twist ending im sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me the ending was just stupid and tacked on before that i was a little bored but actually enjoying it 410
