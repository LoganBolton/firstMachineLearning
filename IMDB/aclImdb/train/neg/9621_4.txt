i was dying to see this once i saw the ridiculous meatballs poster and divined that it had to be the best satire ever what a brilliant idea for a satirethe genre is rife unfortunately the finished product as i think all involved probably realize is a catalogue of missed opportunities notquitethere performances and thankfully a few extremely hilarious inspired bits janeane garafolo who is very striking looks really bad here probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny david hyde pierce is just sad to watch trying to hard to be funny and looking like a castro nerd molly shannon is so funny just seeing her makes you laugh but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical paul rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell the other guys are also really funny the nerdier ones i think the problem is the director just doesnt move things along at the right pace he starts out very deadpan and that sets the monotone but when he lets things get really outrageous the drug sequence is the second funniest moment ive had all year in movies the first also coming in a lame movie andrea martin in all over the guy complaining about the movie in  out its just plain funny i wanted this movie to work so badly but it just didnt the clothes and styling for 1981 are 999 perfect and the very few songs used are also perfect this ends up as a mediumbad mad tv episode complete with frustratingly overlong sketches
