when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it i grew up in the 1980s and like everyone else who has grown up in that era have seen every 80s teen and summer camp movie out there so i couldnt wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre what a disappointment the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over with hardly any plot and no substance and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failedsome of these socalled jokes didnt come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive the only good things about this film were the wardrobe music and acting it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80s and the same goes for the music and the acting was topnotch throughout almost all of hollywoods best comedians were present too bad they didnt have better material to work with
