ben stiller doesnt so much act as react and he does it very well he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him in theres something about mary the standup hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face when he confronts marys other two suitors he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilariousbr br in along came polly the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines of which there are too few having said that hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour  you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile  noticeably through stillers reaction however everyone seems to be acting in a bubble there is very little reaction hoffman and stillers characters could have played off each other much much more aniston again reprises her rachael role but stiller is no ross it is more of a joey with a crush on rachael scenariobr br polly is a bythenumbers romcom and that is its failing  it lacks heart you dont root for the characters with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story but in the end the films failure comes down to poor writing worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night but youll regret forking out cash to see it
