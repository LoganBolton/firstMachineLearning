considering the potential this move had the reality was disappointing while its always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie even that couldnt turn this around most of the action was predictable the jokes were flat to mildly amusing and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened ben stiller was hilarious in theres something about mary here it looks like hes just going thru the motions if they have to lift plot points from friends they should have known something was wrong the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet br br watch 50 first dates instead
