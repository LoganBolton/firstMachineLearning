make no bones about it there are a lot of things wrong with this movie its clichéd the whole way not very funny predictable and illogical lets start at the beginning characters theres the boring luckless guy  giving stiller another notch in his boring luckless guy belt  the allegedly wild but in reality just fairly normal love interest  whom aniston plays well but really needed no effort to do so  the fat jovial friend and then the assortment of clichés an annoying daredevil australian guy a confident spanish guy etc the storyline the beginning is slightly unusual but thereafter goes into the standard anymovie style with every plot turn as predictable as your average knockknock joke the biggest problem was that stillers characters development really seemed to come from nothing  like your average school play the writers knew where he started and where he ended but didnt put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit finally the alleged jokes were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard grossout humour there was a regulation chunder scene sweaty fat men etcbr br in conclusion the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word shart was the only good thing hamburg really dished up a dogs dinner here and the sugar coating of stiller and aniston may have lured the viewers but the taste left at the end was just as rancidbr br final comment this film may have been dreadful but aniston still picked a better betweenfriendsseasons movie than kudrows odious marci x
