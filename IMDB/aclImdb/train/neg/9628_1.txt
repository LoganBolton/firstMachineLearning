this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related itemsbr br no wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this drivelbr br how some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot onbr br how on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable mostly toilet humour and badly done at thatbr br anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs
