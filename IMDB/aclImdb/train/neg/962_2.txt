chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so annoyingunless you believe in psychics reincarnation and the other hocus pocus which this promotes bigtime the recycling of souls they call it here puhleezebr br this story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait its also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr cybill shepherd ryan oneal and mary stuart mastersonbr br at least its a pretty tame film languagewise thats about the only redeeming quality of this movie
