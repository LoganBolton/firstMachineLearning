i have an awful panandscan videotape of boom and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory so i voted 1 and hope you will too together we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing boom in its directors cut extended version the movie is one of my howling favoritesÂ…you just look at the people involved the director the actors the cameraman and you say to yourself yep i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time producers considering the dvd release of boom should note that everywhere its been shown there have been sellout crowds in the theaters but it hasnt been up to frostbite falls yet
