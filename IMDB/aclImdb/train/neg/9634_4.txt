whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscasting phase tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesnt stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his playbut apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the moneybr br whatever it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad babytalk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appearsbr br its so campy that among taylor fans its probably considered a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand youre way ahead of me sadly this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare
