wow pretty terrible stuff the richard burtonelizabeth taylor roadshow lands in sardinia and hooks up with arty director joseph losey for this remarkably illconceived tennessee williams fiasco taylor plays a rich dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates very loudly her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary when scoundrel burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend taylor realizes her time is up ludicrious in the extreme  its difficult to determine if taylor and burton are acting badly or if it was williams intention to make their characters so unappealing if thats the case then the acting is brilliant burton mumbles his lines including the word boom several times while taylor screeches hers shes really awful so is noel coward as taylors catty confidante the witch of capri br br presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along  two standard williams themes but its so misdirected by losey that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues any substance the film has would have been completely diluted br br boom does have stunning photographythe camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of sardinia the supporting cast features joanna shimkus the great romolo valli as taylors resourceful doctor and michael dunn as her nasty dwarf security guardboth he and his dogs do a number on burton
