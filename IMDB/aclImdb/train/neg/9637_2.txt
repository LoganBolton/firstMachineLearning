boy this was one lousy movie while i havent seen all of the burtontaylor collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a putupon staff when shes suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in 1968 no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it werent for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars
