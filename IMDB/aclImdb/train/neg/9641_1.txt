if youre watching this movie youre either a fred olen ray fan you found it on the 499 shelf at suncoast and thought what do i have to lose or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touchedbr br this movie is hysterically bad its got everything a terrible movie needs a screenplay featuring jawdropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space actors that are not only wooden but seems to border on befuddled gratuitous nudity not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for and of course a 5 monster played by what i assume is fred olen rays kidbr br underneath it all however there is something resembling heart  as if mickey  judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie hey my dad can direct it yeah we can use red paint from my johnnys dads hardware store and i know this exstripper who can act in itbr br watch for the blooper reel over the credits  you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappybr br incidentally biohazard iithe alien force is also worth a look but doesnt have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does
