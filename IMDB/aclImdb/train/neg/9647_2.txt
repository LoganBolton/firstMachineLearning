london dreams directed by vipul shah is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people its the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat ajay devgan plays arjun an aspiring popartiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at londons wembley stadium he becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and bandmate manu played by salman khan who is evidently more talented than him but nowhere near as focused or ambitious arjun decides to sabotage manu when the latters popularity threatens to outshine his own now heres where a hearttoheart might have helped had arjun explained what this wembley fixation meant to him manu would have graciously backed off and let arjun fulfill his childhood dream and wed have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel but director vipul shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours london dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that backstory involving arjuns grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stagefright at a packed wembley concert or the ridiculous incident at a show where manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes arjun into silence the idiocy however doesnt end there in his attempts to shame manu publicly arjun uses his connections to get manu hooked onto drugs a buxom groupie urges manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine before you know it manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder practically chomping it down like dinner if that isnt silly enough theres a crude scene later in which manu chases after the said girl to find out who shes been taking orders from the pursuit ends in a dark london alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead manus girlfriend whos been secretly following after them wait theres more expect to howl hysterically when arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the bands lead dancer priya played by asin because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals too generously inspired by milos formans amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last years rock on vipul shahs latest is a clunky melodrama thats as loosely directed as it is scripted the film goes for broad humor overthetop emotions and basically chooses loudness over subtlety that works for manus character with salman khan playing him all loutish and lovable but in the case of arjun ajay devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised when arjun does reach boiling point however it results in an awkward preclimax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment of the remaining cast theres not a kind word i can say for asin who practically lit up ghajini with her ebullient charm but disappoints here with unnecessary overacting in a thankless role ranvijay singh and aditya roy kapur reduced to mere sidekicks in the band show up at regular intervals usually to utter some inane dialogue like well rock it dude for its dimwitted writing and sloppy direction london dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch if you must watch it for salman khan whos turned buffoonery into a bonafide acting style its the only thing thatll make you smile in this sad sad film
