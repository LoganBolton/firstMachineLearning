vipul shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past waqt  the race against time and namaste london were entertaining and interesting to watch singh is kinng was fun which he produced his latest outing as a filmmaker london dreams comes up as his careers weakest farebr br london dreams has a mediocre storyline its about how success turns friendship into hatred agreed it has the potential but when you watch london dreams you wonder whats happening this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times vipul shah the writer puts vipul shah the director down br br the first hour is boring the second hour is better but again the climax is horrendous how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you i wont ajay devgn suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy thanks to his uncle om puri when he reaches india rather than slapping or abusing him salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco was vipul shahs intension to show salmans character as a god if yes than youve failed completely the only question i want to ask vipul shah is that would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception write what you feel dont fool us the audience we are sensible enough to understand whats good or not br br this is a musical but the music by shankareshaanloy is terrible not a single song stays in your mind br br salman is superb though he carries the film on his shoulders and does really really well in the emotional scenes but again his character is shown as a god which makes him look like a retard in the end ajay is equally good but salman has overshadowed him completely asin is wasted and what is a great talent like om puri doing in this film rannvijay hams though aditya roy kapoor excels brinda parekh is alright as the vampbr br on the whole this dream remains a dream
