after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed  not because of the actors story or directing  i was disappointed by this film advertisementsbr br the trailers were suggesting that the battalion have chosen the third way out other than surrender or die polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or german guns they even translated the title wrong as misplaced battalion this have tickled the right spot and i bought the moviebr br the disappointment started when i realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies then i began to think hey this story cant be that simple i bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops well he didnt they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen and so was ibr br the story was based on real events of world war i so the writers couldnt make much use of their imagination but even thought i found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring and as i wrote in the first place  it isnt fault of actors writers or director  their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with
