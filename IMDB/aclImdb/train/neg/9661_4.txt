i want to say the acting is bad but i think it was the directing that made it so i never thought much of highlander same director but that one could be blamed on the 80sbr br this one however has no excuses people get shot while exiting trenches with a man in front of him those kind of mistakes along with an unclear time line weird battle tactics subpar cutting and poor visual effects makes this one a subpar film over allbr br then like so many other have commented all this american bullshit the german general being practically scared of his captured american private be prepared to swallow a lot of it although in small dosesbr br to sum it up a not horrible but still definitely subpar war movie in all aspects
