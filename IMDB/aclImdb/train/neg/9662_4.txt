i usually read reviews before i watch a movie guess what i didnt do that before watching tlb and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb i found it to have a total lack of story you just get dropped into it and sadly not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie and it also has a sudden end which was very unsatisfying for mebr br i have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me especially with the low budget in mind but prepare yourself to have a laugh some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic gymnasts a midair corkscrew or somersault during ww i is a bit too much for me especially when its performed countless times during the moviebr br but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat the screaming and shouting german voicesunbelievably funny it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor  voice performer because they all sound exactly the same and it just sounds like a typical german voicebr br i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it
