how cynical are the writers to pander so i may be an american citizen but i dont need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film im astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in u571 which changes british submariners to american ones but you still walk away feeling a little slimy really the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes how sad unnecessary id just like to say to the writers its obvious to many of us that you cant capture real people with real problems under real pressure and that youve taken some very well tested shortcuts lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugarcoated tripe
