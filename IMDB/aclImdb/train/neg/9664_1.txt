this bookbased movie is truly awful and a big disappointment weve been waiting for this move over a month many film reviewer were hopeful for it also in newspapers and tv it made big sense when 29th april comes many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful why first of all story was so monotone it has been many indefinite scenes sometimes its hard to realize whats going on the actresses out of hulya avsar werent harmonized with their roles especially vildan atasever she acts better in comedy films in this movie a kind of drama she couldnt disposed of her previous role and finally movie is too short just 66 minutes
