having seen triumph of the will i can only say this movie is ghastly even measured against the historically low standards of the time naturally its all totally fabricated and prejudicial this is what one would expect of 1930s german propaganda unfortunately the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap its also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans mustve left the theater holding their noses in a genre renowned for its base appeal lack of originality and unapologetic wrongheadedness this film doesnt even qualify as bad it would have to improve significantly to attain that status
