this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced the insistent equation of jews with disease is simplybr br pathological and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief secondsbr br through its sheer repetition the fact that something this crude works evenbr br briefly is an object lesson in itself you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this and i wouldnt recommend trying unless you have a good reason
