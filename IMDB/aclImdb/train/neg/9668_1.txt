1940  a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazioccupied poland recorded by a german cameramen with the naive cooperation of the jewish community is combined with archival footage clips from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the worlds jews as swindlers and parasites this documentary interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional antisemitism and nazi ideology a candid cinematicallyunique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again
