somewhere id read that this film is supposed to be a comedy after seeing it id call it anything but the point of this movie eludes me the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content theres nothing erotic about this filmall leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about the title premise could have been the basis for a fun if politically incorrect comedy instead were treated to cheap amateurish unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake if i want that ill go buy a grace jones cd
