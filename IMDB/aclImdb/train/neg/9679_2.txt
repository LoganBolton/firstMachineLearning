this movie was awful in the worst way you just didnt care you didnt care what happened in the plot you didnt care about the characters everyone was devoid of heart i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didnt want to subject my mind to it any more there is far too much sex in the film sex can be okay it can even make the movie hence karma sutra but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy it was just ugly dont see this film
