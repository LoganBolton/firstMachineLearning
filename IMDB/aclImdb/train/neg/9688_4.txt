greenaways films pose as clever erudite and innovative yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the world war 1 era of filmmaking the frame composition use of midshot the static camera it may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new perhaps like that other innovator ts eliot he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or couldbr br yet greenaways biggest failing is that he cannot write his dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician brecht where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor which is poised and logical so the joke is dead before its delivered the result is tedium if its not funny it has failed ask a standup comedian to justify their act if the audience doesnt respond perhaps the wellread director could learn something from freud on humorbr br finally like woody allen greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones they speak the lines with a bored smug air like narcissistic adolescentsbr br this film despite its design and lighting is meretricious
