this is shallow hedonism andor social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young womans scheme to drive apart her father and his fianc√©e is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an electra complex who cares all of the characters except for anne deborah kerr are vacuous and vile seberg is poor i agree with the boys with breasts comment of an earlier review the plot plodded this predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half if you want to see great gowns and jewels on the riviera i recommend to catch a thief  in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters br br i like for films to entertain me i personally dont really care where a film is set whatever the time or place i want a good story  comedy or drama i also want to see some enjoyable characters it doesnt hurt if i can relate to them poor deborah kerr gives a typically good performance and so does david niven in a despicable rolebr br the 2 rating is solely for kerr and niven and for the cinematography  the rich color scenes and the murky foreboding black and white scenes unfortunately all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with unenjoyable characters a sows ear is still a sows ear consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time
