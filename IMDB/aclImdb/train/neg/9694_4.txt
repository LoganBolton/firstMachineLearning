otto preminger directs this light as a feather story bohemian jean seberg and her equally bohemian widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty mylène demongeot things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up nivens a degenerate womanizer finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist thats fine with seberg as long as niven loves her and leaves her as hes done with all the women in his pastincluding demongeot when it appears as though shes becoming second banana in nivens life seberg exact revenge on kerr preminger tells the story in flashbacks from sebergs perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes the cinematography by georges périnal is stunning the film features some of premingers least heavyhanded direction although he rarely allows any closeups which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling arthur laurents wrote the script and its full of acidic dialog and funny scenes mostly involving birdbrained demongeot seberg acquits herself fairly well but niven is at his least appealingand he shows no chemistry with either seberg or kerr preminger really missteps with that casting its a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer with geoffrey horne as sebergs wouldbe suitor and martita hunt as his daffy mother juliette gréco playing herself sings the title song in a paris nightclub the great titles are by preminger regular saul bass
