ive seen the first of the dwarfmovies and sometimes i had little fun watching it there are many famous tvcomedyactors appearing in the first part and presented in fantasy costumes typical little episodes of their standupprogram and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with everything was already therenothing new to obtain youre familiar with most of the often boring and dumb jokes and you always feel like their goal was to put in every comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage theres nothing important about the story typical fairytale story of rumpelstiltskin without any importance i expected something like that but thats nothing i could complain about im actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didnt get it anyway this crap is except the great appearance of helge schneider a total waste of time and moneyif you dont like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap thats broad casted every friday evening on sat1 or rtl for free im sure you will recognize some laugthers i saw last night in cinema
