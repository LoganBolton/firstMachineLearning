there are a lot of highly talented filmmakersactors in germany now none of them are associated with this moviebr br why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage its not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs pretending to be funny what is funny though is that the films producer who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch is playing the youngest dwarfbr br the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying youre supposed to laugh now its hard to believe that this craps supposed to be a comedybr br many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie i should have done the same instead of wasting my timebr br pain
