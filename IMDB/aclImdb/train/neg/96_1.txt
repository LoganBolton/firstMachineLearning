oh wait i can this movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match i couldnt tell where i was in this movie one second theyre in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70s driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as 80s style clothing i think i couldnt pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible i think it only got attention because it has a 3d which i did not watch if youre a bmovie buff and by bmovie i mean bad movie then this film is for you its homemovie and all nonsense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni though just skip this one
