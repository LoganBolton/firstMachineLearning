a really bad sequel part 1 had a lot of funny moments  part 2 is just bad in a boring way and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fansbr br shame on you otto waalkesbr br the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be pised about the other characters its quite easy to identify with himbr br the screenplay is sloppynonexistent the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play br br technically the movie is awful as well but who can blame the cinematographersound guys who had to work with such an untalented director
