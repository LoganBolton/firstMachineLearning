i dont think this movie was rated correctly i took my copy and blacked out the pg rating and wrote down r i would not recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 whatever the r limit isbr br why it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women i dont know about you but thats not something for little children to be watching true it might be the traditional clothing style of the african  indians but i think partial nudity should give a movie an r ratingbr br i havent seen the movie recently but i guess otherwise it was alright
