when the employees of a theater find an old reel of film they decide to show it at the midnight screening of night of the living dead assuming its an old preview reel unfortunately its actually an old nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombiesbr br i cant understand the hate for this movie it is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp but it doesnt deserve a 11 here on imdb it is just so much fun it is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them it has the feel of such things as night of the living dead in many ways very similar evil dead 2 and army of darkness and various othersbr br i liked the explanation of how the zombies though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies actually come to have the physical attributes of the living deadunbelievable perhaps but i appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it the gore effects were decent for the budget the acting was all right and the story was entertainingbr br i liked it
