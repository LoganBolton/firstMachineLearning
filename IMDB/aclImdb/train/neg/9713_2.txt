the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other american crime shows aired roughly the same timebr br i saw it and i was bored to death the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 102030 or even 60 years seems so unlikelybr br the time is also a factor as they only have 5060 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive this combined with the personal problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lacklusterbr br i give it a 2star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching itwhich you then of course wont do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap
