this program is really overrated a detective like danny pinos hotheaded character would have been transferred to the rubber gun squad years ago the whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007 every vietnam veteran character theyve ever had has turned out to be the killer unless it was another vietnam veteran there has only been one black murderer and he was put up to it by his white boss the only hispanic killer was a race traitor who killed another hispanic to frame a hispanic street kid for a crime that naturally two rich white kids committed what a bunch of propaganda heyscreenwriters minorities and poor people commit murder too only on this show are most murderers upperclass whitesbr br whats more the arrests of people in their 70s 80s and 90s for crimes they committed 5060 years ago are a joke no reallife da will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick the state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they wont serve a day the only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or exnazis whose highprofile convictions boost das careers
