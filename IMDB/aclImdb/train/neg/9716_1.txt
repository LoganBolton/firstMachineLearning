this is without doubt one of the worst films ive ever seenbr br the plot is so full of holes the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time worst of all is steve guttenberg he plays his character like he was in police academy  the same foolish womanizer  and thats not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thrillerbr br its really hard to believe that hanson would make la confidential ten years laterbr br avoid this like the plague
