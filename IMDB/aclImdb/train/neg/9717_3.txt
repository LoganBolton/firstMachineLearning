a pretty obvious thrillerbynumbers in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing i was watching principally for the englishlanguage performance by isabelle huppert it wasnt great but then it was a strange role i wouldnt be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cuttingroom floor along with several last minute script rewritesbr br the acting is the least appealing thing about this film steve guttenburg looks like hes trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyones told him he has theres a sensationally stupid sequence in which its suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat ptsd its an uninteresting performance elizabeth mcgovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but its small consolation 310
