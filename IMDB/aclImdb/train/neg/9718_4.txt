an innocent man steve guttenberg has a onenight stand with his bosss wife isabelle huppert she spots a woman elizabeth mcgovern being attacked outside but she cant call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenbergs boss paul shenar so guttenberg honest citizen that he is when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert well  never bear false witness against thy neighbor as they saybr br this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted when he meets the first nearvictim mcgovern she immediately twigs to what happened but agrees to keep quiet for the moment but then guttenberg finds himself in court supposed to identify the heavy greenquist and we discover through crossexamination that he is nearsighted and cant identify objects at a distance let alone faces not that it matters because after all he never saw the creep in the first place the plot gets practically labyrinthine guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered toobr br he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the nowsympathetic mcgovern guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer she will serve as bait theyll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to just to get him to try to kill her but everything will be okay see because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive but she will keep a can of mace handy  just in casebr br i ask you the alert viewer does this scenario unfold as planned elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times but shes vibrant steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and thats about it otherwise hes as helpless as the character he plays if isabelle huppert can act it isnt evident in this film the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like hes wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirsbr br didnt the director curtis hanson go on to make la confidential that was a nicely done piece of work here everything seems clumsy and contrived down to the small bit parts just before the inevitable violent climax a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgoverns rescue and the scene is embarrassing to watch dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper hes a neat guy and always reliable paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job toobr br that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes was shot at a bar in carolina beach in north carolina not far from where i lived the way the interior is set up its clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in realitybr br overall this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story
