jeux denfants or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just dont know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool dudes i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow olderand instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great peoplebr br one could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created amelie a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away frombr br avoid avoid avoid
