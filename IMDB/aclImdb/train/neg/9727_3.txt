another of my delves into the bargain bin this movie gave me exactly what i expected  a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladiesbr br it all started so well  i liked the little intro with the newsreel about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught firebr br from then onwards the film descended into outright silliness and at times became almost embarrassing to watch when the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character the ability to light ones own farts without the aid of a match it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment thatll be good you can almost hear them say as for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant wellbr br the movie came across as cheap tat  if you pay more than Â£150 for it youve been done
