tobe hooper has made great movies so i was certain this couldnt be bad i didnt read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film at times this made me laugh sometimes i almost fell asleep sometimes made me almost cry for hooperbr br i rated this 310 because its 1990 horrormovie and many interesting or funny things happened there throughout the movie i was thinking something like they simply cant add more things in this movie  but they didbr br some tell this is some sort of firestarter clone but truly isnt its based on that idea but thats all this is combination of horror comedy weird religiongod things funny gore simple effects drama horrible acting unbelievable scriptand morebr br spoilers story is government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails during process child is born for 2 test persons when mom sings to her child after the birth both husband and wife burns and it is spontaneous combustion government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and  then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and  well when the government realizes okay now he can set this fire thing to work they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man because they could kill him no they cant shoot him no  and argh i guess thats enough to tell i promise there is 100 more weird things in this moviebr br well if you want good laughs watch this one gosh
