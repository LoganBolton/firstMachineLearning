this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares for a horror or thriller film and hype its way too tame there are only a few tense moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre even those tense scenes werent much the music made them more dramatic that they actually werebr br there is a lot of symbolism in here so the elitist critics label this a thinking persons horror film well if they think about it im sure they will come to the same conclusion i did  a waste of money at the video rental storebr br summary a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised
