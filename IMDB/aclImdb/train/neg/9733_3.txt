pretty poor firestarter clone that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourifbr br government contractors do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees and when hes an adult people in his life start spontaneously combusting he tries to find out whybr br the people completely on fire are well done but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense theyre obviously changed to dummies when jets of fire shoot out of characters arms it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receivers earpiece how is that supposed to happen exactlybr br something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents we later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies
