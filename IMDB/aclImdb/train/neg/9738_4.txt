not as bad as its credited to being hoopers done far worse more so disappointing for me such an imaginative concept which is never really tapped in to by hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky excuse the pun writing it goes so sinister and overthetop in a dead serious tone becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery  conspiracylaced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt because of that the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and brad dourif cool to see him in a leading role seems to struggle with an offbalanced performance despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his offcolour character even though its cheaply done theres a competent technical attitude to it however it doesnt seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts which some do work and strikingly steaming special effects flames flames everywhere instead hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery more so towards the latter end and the camerawork is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating the performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of william prince cynthia bain dey young jon cypher and melinda dillon also geroge buck flower and john landis have small but amusing cameos especially landis nothing surprises but its passably engaging
