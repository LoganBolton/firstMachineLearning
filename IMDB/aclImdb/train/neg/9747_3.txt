ok first of all this movie sucks but lets examine why the proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy storing it and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing but thats as far as they take this premise instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine they break the damn thing this could have been a good premise living with the responsibilty of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation ie the invisible man but no they break the damn thing and lembach wants to leave so then the doctor jerryrigs the thing back together and trys to transport himself only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary duh which wouldnt happened if lembach hadnt decided to leave so now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed and they wouldnt give him money wah then to make the movie worse throw in a dry british relationship between the two semicompetent professors hired to assist him between their loving sessions they make a couple of halfhearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of london all of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine which would never have happened if lembach hadnt left this movie tried so i give it an honest 2 stars for effort but it would have been better if they hadnt broke the damn machine making lembach leave making him try it again damn you lembach
