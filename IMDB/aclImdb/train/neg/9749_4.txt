professor paul steiner is doing research in matter transference he has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear only to have that object rematerialize in a different location but there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesnt succeed after a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding professor steiner decides to test his machine on himself as expected things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will killbr br in hindsight maybe it wasnt such a good idea to rewatch the projected man in the same week i watched the fly return of the fly and curse of the fly there seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period im not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for the projected man but much of it is so similar to the fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence however the projected man isnt even nearly as good as the worst of the fly trilogybr br besides being terribly unoriginal the projected man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie a big issue i have is with bryant haliday in the lead hes such a horses ass that not only do i not care about his suffering i actually root for it supporting cast members mary peach and ronald allen are almost as bad theyre so bland and dull they hardly matter in fact theres very little to get excited about while watching the projected man the soundtrack  not very memorable the look  i would describe much of it as muddy the plot  predictable the action  there isnt any overall this is one to avoidbr br fortunately i watched the projected man via a copy of the mystery science theater 3000 episode funny stuff while not an absolute very often the poorer the movie  the better the mst3k riffs the guys hit almost all of their marks with the projected man ill give it a very enthusiastic 45 on my mst3k rating scale
