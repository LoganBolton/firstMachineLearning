this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewers part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didnt do anything for me i still dont really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a persons life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i cant recommend this movie to anyone
