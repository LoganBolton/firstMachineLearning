the only reason i dont give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isnt quite on par with a movie like manos the hands of fate this movies greatest crime is the fact that it is headmeltingly boring  terribly unforgivably british the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising the whole teleporting concept but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting it was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers the actors were wooden unemotional and aloof as was the love affair between the two scientists which was anything but intriguing i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was nonexistent nor did i really understand why the meltyfaced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research grants else they go rampaging about killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures
