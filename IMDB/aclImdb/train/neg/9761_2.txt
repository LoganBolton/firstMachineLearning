its pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the palestinian girl and her family the film and its website tries to imply that ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and rachel up a boyfriend problem perhaps pregnancy neatly glossed over is the fact that ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the israelisjust outside her home goshso why on earth would a young pretty intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing could it be that the hormonal emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes this detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie another neatly sidestepped detail is that avigail levy rachels mother could have prevented the destruction of the building the akhras family lived inalong with 22 other families one distinctly gets the impression that shes offering this as a concession  should mrs akhras agree to speak with herwhy should i she sayssince the movie was made the home has been destroyed apparently the interview didnt result in what she wanted so bring on the bulldozersmrs levy claimed that she wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue ayats mother while dangling the house as a carrotmoreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her palestinian neighbors that she really thinks that mrs akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffeepleaseand she forgoes the one chance she had to meet mrs akhras in person and see what kind of life she livesthe akras family originally came from jaffa but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the levys live in comparative luxuryany sympathy i would have had for the obviously well to do mrs levy is dissolved by her air of selfrighteous bitchinessby contrast ayats mother comes off as kindforthright and loving in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters heck even the music and sound design was one sided i guess the muezzin sings all day every day 4 miles from the levy family home always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy newage music that scores this drab excuse for a documentaryalso there is the small matter of translations  mrs levy directly addresses the camera in english when she has something worked out to say ahead of time hebrew when she doesnt mrsakhras spoke only arabic which received sometimes a translation sometimes transliteration always awkward and very suspect for a supposedly objective moviethey also sweated her under the lights while mrs levy sat in air conditioned comfortrotten editing for mrs akhras segments too i gave it a 2 because i liked ayats mother and father who seemed like good decent people shame on hbo producers and director for releasing such a stinkbomb
