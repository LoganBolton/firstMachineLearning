i dont hand out ones often but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention its gas this is selfindulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of mash and falls completely flat on its face in the attemptbr br i see what corman was going for  malcolm marmorstein and elliott gould tried to reproduce goulds deathless role in the original movie version of mash with a similar plot in the movie whiffs  look it up here in imdb httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0073891 for more informationbr br marmorstein and gould got closer to the brass ring with whiffs than corman did with gas but didnt quite get there neither one of those films even got close to the success of mashbr br whats wrong with gas what isnt no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics the production values stink someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car and theres more of that lack of attention to detail nothing works the way its supposed to in this film and nobody caresbr br gas actually put me to sleep its not a sure cure for insomnia but really close on the cinematic sleep induction scale gas falls somewhere between last year at marienbad and george clooneys remake of solaris which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the mosfilm original despite that studios seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audiences attention by judicious editingbr br judicious editing would have decimated gas to about twenty minutes the result would be pointless but no more so than the original filmbr br certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway this isnt one of them dont waste your time its not even amusingly bad
