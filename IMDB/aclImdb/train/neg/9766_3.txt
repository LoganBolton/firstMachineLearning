roger corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directorsproducers in history he was singlehandedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever like the edgar allen poe adaptations masque of the red death and pit and the pendulum as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies like creature from the haunted sea and she gods of the shark reef corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and  simply put  nearly impossible to judge properly the trip for example as well as this imaginatively titled gassss can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation in other words theyre incredibly strange hippieculture influenced movies half of the time you havent got the slightest idea whats going on who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going the plot is simply and yet highly effective a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25 this could be the basic premise of an atmospheric gritty and nailbitingly suspenseful postapocalyptic scifi landmark but writer george armitage and roger corman decided to turn it into a trippy roadmovie comedy none of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime syndicates gassss is a disappointingly boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre the entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny definitely not my cup of tea but the film does have a loyal fan base and many admirers so who am i to say that its not worth your time or money
