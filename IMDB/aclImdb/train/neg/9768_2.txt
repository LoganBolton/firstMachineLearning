when i first popped in happy birthday to me i checked the timer to see how long the film was i was amazed at the length both animated and horror films share a common ground attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes anything more and youll lose the bulk of your audiencebr br this 110 minutes or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me id like to say half of this movie couldve been edited out but i would be too generous to say that go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes couldve been edited even without being a film majorbr br regardless of the overstayed visit the movie was below mediocre it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the elite 10 is killing off the remaining friends for the most part they not only overdo it but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say its this guy no its this gal youll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie and dont get me started on the actingbr br okay that got me started i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the prairie later research proved my suspicions correct because all the way through this movie she genuinely looked blind strange as an established actress she shouldve been the best of the group but turned out the worst the rest of the staff aside from ann bregman was pretty damn bad too but she uh took the cakebr br the movie begins with a group of ten friends and ones immediately killed off barely anyone thinks twice of this dear friends disappearance so they continue on their merry way slowly then more rapidly there are revelations about virginias anderson the main character past and her psychologist whos a tad bit more personal and on call 247 apparently than most shrinks all the while more and more deaths occurbr br whats funny is just as the first disappearance the more best buds vanish the less the rest care sure they give a few seconds of air time to say wow that person just wouldnt run off etc but then theyre back to their sexual ways and speaking of which its probably due to the horrid script or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute 30 but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene see the creepy guy that kept a mouserat in his pocket  literally  and was the most obvious suspect im giving the film too much credit and time but how he became part of the elite 10 ill never knowbr br but i digress theres a mystery here why are these kids targets why is virginia thinking shes killed someone when it was never proved till the end that any of them actually has been slaughtered and why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see hell even for 1981 most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the 13th films  coincidentally enough friday the 13th part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of happy birthday to me perhaps theyre speaking of when they filmed it months prior but were late to the well partybr br when the secrets are revealed trust me youll have to rewind 34x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives and even then put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victimkillers words even if you get the first time its an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale its almost worth watching the whole movie again but as a drinking gamebr br this birthday gathering should be avoided its a horrible and illogical first draft script  please please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and its 100 unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstancesbr br side note when i was a kid or say 1011 years old i loved horror films still do oddly definite guilty pleasures but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass we got our first vcr and i taped as many horror films off network or edited versions tv all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape which scared me to death  and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was even though i have seen other clips of this movie i think this is the first fulllength viewing ive had thankfully this awful movie didnt wound me as a child i am older now and i can take this trash but never againbr br side note 2 that said that crazy happy birthday to me song played in the end credits and as a score throughout still creeps me out tremendously i guess this movie or last few minutes did have an influence on my childhood shame on you melissa sue anderson
