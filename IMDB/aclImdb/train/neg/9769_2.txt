i read this thornton wilder play last year in eighth grade i was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen let me tell you its not a terrific play it is easily surpassed but man it deserves a much better shot the acting was really lacking the sceneryhonest to godlooked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of threeyearolds as if it couldnt get worse the sound quality is lousythere is this mindnumbing buzz whenever an actor speaksand i also couldnt help but notice that the chemistry between george and emily well is nonexistant the actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there there is no music it is in black and white which would be ok but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more in any case i think that if youre going to make a point of seeing this movie which i dont really reccomend then dont aim your hopes to high the play as stalwart as it is is probably better
