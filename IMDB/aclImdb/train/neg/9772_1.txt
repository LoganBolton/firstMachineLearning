just too many incidents of violencebr br the film goes from one scene to another and in nearly every one violence eruptsbr br now i am not one who is shocked by violence and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing but please not one after another my reaction was not shock or horror it was here we go again there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely and couldnt wait for the endbr br if this is the best the film makers can do they should find something else to do with their miserable lives like making shoes or delivering mail
