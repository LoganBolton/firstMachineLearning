when this was released i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made however thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him there have been mainline films worse languagewise than thisbut this is a pretty brutal assault on ones ears hey i can take a lot of it but this got ridiculous in the first six minutes alone i heard a halfdozen usages of the lords name in vain plus an untold number of fwords i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 i couldnt have been the only onebr br not surprisingly some of the feature actors included jennifer jasonleigh burt young jerry orbach and rikki lake since this film stephen lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the godly stonewall jackson in gods and generals langs role here is just the opposite perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the filmbr br depressing gloomy semipornographic repulsive these are just a few of the adjectives people used  even some liberal critics  in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel of course some of the betterknown critics all extreme libs praised the movie however they were the only ones most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public its unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like thisbr br trust me on this there are no good likable characters in this entire movie this is a mean sick film one of the worst of the modern era that is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on  two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people no thanks
