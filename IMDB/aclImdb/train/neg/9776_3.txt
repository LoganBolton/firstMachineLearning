i dont know much about filmmaking but good movies have to tell some sort of a storyyour characters have to start and complete their journey in last exit to brooklyn they may but its not in any satisfying way and im not meaning a happy ending just any endingbr br last exit to brooklyn set in 1952 brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike sets a number of story threads in motion most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen but last exit to brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusionit leaves some of them dangling with no ending or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an artistic endingbr br two cases in point and they contain spoilersbr br a sad transvestite character an important character in the film is struck by a car and killed and thats it for him in the moviehes gone for good erased from everyones memoryno reactions from his friends enemies loversnothingbr br in another thread the stupid clueless and secretly gay strike leader having been rejected by labor his gay lover and found out by the neighborhood thugs gets stomped by the thugs the closing scene to the beating shows the streets of brooklyn and the streetlights are very very similar to those of nazi death campsand the scene drags on and on and onand the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader and hes been crucifiedppppuuuulllleeeeeez and of course thats it for him toobrain erasuregonebr br bottom lineno matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this filmthis movie is a depressing piece of sludge avoid it and if you dont be forewarned it really deserves an nc17 rating for massive amounts of physical emotional and sexual brutalitydont even let the teenagers watch
