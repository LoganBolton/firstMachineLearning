im sure that operations dames was a favorite at the driveins back in the day theres absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied and if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the moodbr br otherwise there aint a whole lot that operations dames has going for it its set in the korean war where a platoon of gis together with a british tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the un lines bad enough already but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of uso girls and their choreographer in the same predicamentbr br you know whats sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the army and in combat situations these bimbos from the uso set womens liberation back light years in fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pantsbr br but that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drivein for this no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effortbr br operations dames is definitely a team flop
