relentlessly stupid nobudget war picture made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyernot a bad idea in itselfbut that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it laughable script performances that wouldnt pass muster in an elementaryschool christmas pageant inept action scenes confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde stoumenwho is apparently not quite sure if hes making a comedy a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering ta by early 1960s standards anyway travelogue of eve meyers magnificent bodyand a general air of shoddiness and incompetence worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff but thats pretty much it
