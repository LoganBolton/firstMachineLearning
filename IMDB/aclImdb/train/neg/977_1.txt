fever pitch isnt a bad film its a terrible filmbr br is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that theyll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs thats the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because theres nothing funny in this film is getting good reviewsbr br i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funnybr br the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 peter hedges found hornbys voice for about a boy 2002 and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in 2000 writers dv devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didnt go wrong because they kept the essence of hornbys wit and humor they made one of the best films of that yearbr br so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasnt a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understandbr br but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornbys work in americanizing the story theyve butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornbys work and replacing it with conventional drivelbr br theyve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function ones overweight the seconds cynical and ambitious and the thirds a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon hasbr br what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny theyre so insignificant theyre not even decorative the only reason theyre in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindseys pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack wouldve made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious scriptbr br there isnt a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch its almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing gurus formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and prestobr br directors bobby and peter farrelly dont help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the vo narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetingsbr br barrymore does cute and adorable better than most shes as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday but even her cuteness cant save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story about 30 minutes into the film lindsey tells ben youre funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for fallons ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overactsbr br fallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallons cohort tina fey knows a thing or two about comedybr br actors who think theyre funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny thats true of fallon he thinks hes hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his stuttering unsureofhimself shtick didnt work on the small screen its lousier on the big screenbr br unfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular  the first in a park the second in front of bens school  are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesnt even run the gamut from a to bbr br ben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an oaf and not a lovable one at that it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare fallons performance to firths in the british version and youll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced fallons ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcherbr br just as high fidelity did an americanized fever pitch couldve worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the 1997 british version and read hornbys book instead
