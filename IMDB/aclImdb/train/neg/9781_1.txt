i dont think im too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie ive ever seen ive been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river kwai all black and white which all have good plots rich characters and great acting ive seen better dialog and acting in studentwritten high school one act plays the plot however isnt a bad premise  just poorly implemented its kind of like a traffic accident though i couldnt seem to turn it off a movie doesnt need big money or great sets ie twelve angry men and lifeboat to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking
