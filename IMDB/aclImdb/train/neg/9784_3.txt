mind my friends and i saw the movie based off its title alone its cute though obvious in its plot and direction you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes my main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters an alcoholic father overworked mother stressedout sister thats a bad family but aside from the occasional mention from the sister theres not any resolution i was also confused as to the scene with the bottles it seemed pretty randombr br the writing is a secondary concern the kids werent bad actors but their script left a lot to be desired unfortunately what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single blah special effect lame scripting and a glaringly obvious plot
