ok i bought this film from woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in itbr br but we decided it to watch it anyway just for hilarity purposesbr br and im sorry but this has got to be one of the worst films in historybr br it began off alright and we thought ok this might actually be ok but after about 10 minutes we were sadly mistakenbr br it began when the mysterious paint baller turned out to be the most obvious character the scouseraustralian i say that because he had an accent which couldnt be identified whos acting might i just say was abysmalbr br then it got to the end and by that time we had all lost the will to live the paint ball finalsbr br the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didnt actually win but annoyingly enough they won by defaultbr br and i know this has nothing to do with it but the name the team were given was just awful critical damage i mean they could of picked a more awesome name like the destroyers of the antichrist or something or thats what the film should of been called anyway
