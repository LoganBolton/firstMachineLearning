 but the trouble of this production is that its very far from a good musicalbr br granted one cant always expect the witty masters like sondheim or bernstein or porter yet the music of this piece makes even andrew lloyd webber look witty its deadly dull and uninventive with one or two exceptions and just after i watched it i couldnt recall a single significant melody  which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole another hundred people from three listeningsbr br it is also strangely untheatrical it takes place on an incredibly large stage one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left and does absolutely nothing with it when theres supposed to be one person singing onstage thats just what you get  and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty for me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watchbr br the fact remains cole porter seems to have captured the french culture in his works better than these notalents can ever come close to and im puzzled by the popularity of this wouldbelegendary musical
