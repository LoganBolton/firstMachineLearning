they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someones vague recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasnt so misleading id give it a better reviewbr br but seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood filmbr br the book stuart little isnt about a mouse its about a person who happens to be very small and mouselike hes born to his parents not adopted the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on there is a cat named snowball who thinks hes food and wants to eat him but snowball cant talk br br in the movie they screw all of that up i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names
