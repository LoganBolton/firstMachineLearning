basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child at the adoption agency they meet a mouse stuart and they decide to adopt him if you think that this is stupid hold it because its getting worsebr br stuart arrives to his new home where he is treated like a human child spare me the rest is pretty much the usual cliché about family problems jealousy from the elder brother and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a happy family boring and worn out as this is it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated waybr br i dont know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché or he was just trying to fill in minutes but he only upgraded the cliché from boring to abhorrentbr br then why i gave a 3 and not a zero because of the family cat who loves stuart as much as the brother and because of some funny gigs where stuart makes good use of his small sizebr br on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if a stuart was a pet and not a sibling b it had kept to the funny gigs like stuart trying to outwit the cat and had left out boring clichés which dont even match with anything else
