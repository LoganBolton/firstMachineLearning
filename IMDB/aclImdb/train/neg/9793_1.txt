mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfitsbr br the special effects look like they are from the 70s the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain awfulbr br the only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kidsbr br there are far better shows for your kids to watchbr br try giving your kids something like nickelodean those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers
