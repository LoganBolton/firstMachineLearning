okay i seriously cant think of anything worse than the pr series there are many bad things in lifetraitors liars etc but seriously power rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list can you think of anything more stupid than fivesix teenagers who dont even act like a normal teen dancing around in identical suits with different colors so that you can tell them apart fans have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured power rangers are for fiveyear old boys and believe me i never liked this show even when i was fivebr br i guess you can say dino thunder is an exception the teens actually act like teens and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor or no a teacher its got teenhumor though the fighting is lame i dont hate dino thunderbr br many people say power rangers are crap but i wouldnt it would be an insult to crap so face it five year old boys power rangers is rubbish
