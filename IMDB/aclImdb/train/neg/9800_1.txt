mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993 supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s now as a fan of japanese action films and series you would think i would get a kick out of this showbr br you could not be more wrong what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangersbr br mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robotbr br now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie yet the ridiculousness of this show is often overlookedbr br it was followed by two really bad and i do mean really bad movie knock offs and the actors starring in this series completely disappeared from the scenebr br if you must choose try watching japans zyuranger series insteadbr br also whats up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys it makes them all look feminine
