i never quite understood the popularity of sabans power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate americanized version of japans ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version characterization special effects etcbr br of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrectbr br im sure if they spoke japanese they would learn how much better super sentai is over the american versionbr br power rangers is completely awful try super sentai instead looking for a better show try voltron the third dimension instead
