i cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the childrens television show power rangers is all aboutbr br i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoeverbr br the costumes look completely atrocious like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gymbr br what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems what is up with the awful hair cuts and clothing on this show anyway not to mention this show is still playing on cable television just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problembr br theres far better entertainment for todays children hopefully they arent as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this showbr br oh and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway
