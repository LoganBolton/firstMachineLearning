very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb but mighty morphin power rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful its terriblebr br i wouldnt have minded if this had been an animated series wouldve been better that way i guess but as a liveaction show it typifies the terms cheesy and campy of which power rangers is five multi coloured spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills the costumes are horrid they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear the acting is woeful and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch it makes jean claude van damme look as equally as good as bruce lee which is an understatement in itself in fact they look as if they are jumping and dancing about like it was some version of the nutcracker or they were doing ballet rather than fighting besides there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a funyet not so cheesy way that makes it look sillybr br kids show or not this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity and even though this version is set in america you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us but rather in japan thus the somewhat fake fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese versiononly to be juxtaposed onto the us versionbr br if you like this type of thing then stick with sentai the japanese equivalent
