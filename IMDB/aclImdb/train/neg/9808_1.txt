worst show ive ever seen the story is about a group of teenagers who for some inexplicable reason have super powers and when they use some special device they morph into strange poorly designed suits the acting when theyre not in the retardedlooking suits is decent definitely not good but not the worst acting ive ever seen however when wearing their suits the actors acting goes from bad to worse much much worse the hyperanimated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do even when they talk they look like theyre having seizures the villains are stupider than the rangers every episode some weak idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the rangers heshe then sends a force of hyperanimated aliens to attack the rangers the rangers then initialize their 10hour transforming animation then they annihilate the aliens then the poorly designed villain which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil to a humanoid ladybuglike creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation the power rangers fight the villain off then the villain turns into godzilla whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile yes they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants the power rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyperanimated and summon their zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real the power rangers win the villain gets mad they all teach a valuable lesson and the show ends thats it twentyfive minutes of brainwashing fake kung fu fighting
