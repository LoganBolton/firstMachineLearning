some wonder why there werent anymore mrs murphy movies after this one will its because this movie totally blew snot disney was not the right studio to run this film maybe touchstone well theyre owned by disney but itd be more adult the film is too kidish as the book series is not the casting is all wrong for the characters the characters dont even act the way they do in the books and why was tucker changed to a guy hes a girl in the frigging books was this done to make the film appeal to boys sheesh and where was pewter the gray cat one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth rita mae brown is a good writer but letting disney blow her work was wrong an animated feature film perhaps in the vane of don bluths artwork would suit a better mrs murphy film overall i give this a 2 because at least disney made a film from an underappreciated book series but i wish they did better either way i still have my books to entertain me
