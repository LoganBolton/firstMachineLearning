this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie misery 1990 i cannot understand how this movie got a 52 score because it has no story what so ever and when the movie finally ended i was relievedbr br this movie should have been released as a shortmovie instead to much time is spent on the same thing and as in every bad movie everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 1015 minutes time spanbr br so before you decide to watch this movie be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control because you are going to do whole lot of fastforwarding dont worry you wont miss anything important
