wowsheer brilliancebr br turning a thrillersuspensehorror into comedybr br after watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie beforea ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed  either not written in depth or too much depthbr br if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watchbr br be sure to keep focused for the classic food processor scene and the totally inept police investigation scenesbr br this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave
