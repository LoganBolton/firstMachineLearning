im glad some people liked this but i hated this film it had a very good idea for a story line but thats where it ended it was badly written badly acted and badly madebr br  it had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross instead it was whats going on 5 seconds later they tell youbr br this film had no suspense and i was bored from start to end i just wanted it to finishbr br  go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end
