it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one i continued to watch every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously well as seriously as this genre requestsbr br the acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clich√©d if a film was made in 1920 for example and had the quality of hide  seek cord in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive as it happens this film was made in 2000 and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this onebr br definitely not for the serious moviegoerbr br not worth a rating
