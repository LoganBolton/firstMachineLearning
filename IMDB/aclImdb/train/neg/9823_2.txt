there is an interesting discussion in this movie is being a moral person good enough or do you need something morebr br the movie preaches that without the guidance of god being a morally good person is not enough there is a line early in the movie you and i can look at a person who is morally good but both know he is going to go to hellbr br while i am not a christian the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating but not in the way the movie intended i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good is enough the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance fanaticism can be a powerful thing especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated as george carlins character in dogma said hook em while theyre youngbr br the basic premise is a very interesting one also a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok as long as the morality is meaningful do you only tell a child not to steal or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because well how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolenbr br the author carlisle wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book to spread the world however it needs unanimous consent and one of the scholars opposes it he brings up in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for moralitys sake vs gods words argument to prove his point he produces a time machine put in the movie solely to make the plot work which im fine with and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead usbr br as should be obvious he has his opinion and is changed by what he sees and has reversed himself by the time of his return for he does return thats not really a spoiler this is a bible movie after allbr br as for the movie as a movie itself its pretty slow and pretty poorly acted something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two bad guys who want to try to figure out who carlisle is even tho he hasnt hurt anyone committed a crime or anything whats wrong with the movie just showing carlisles opinion showing his view of this sinful world and returning him with a new viewpoint br br also there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that im happy im not a christian or at least someone who says its god or nothing three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me first when the two bad guys corner carlisle right before he jumps carlisle does his only truly despicable act he fakes like his timejump is the coming of jesus and makes it so the bad guys who are also christians btw oddly enough think they just missed the rapture br br secondly after carlisle returns he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing but not mentioning god kid kept the marbles and ran away and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it like the carlin quote above scaring kids into religion is a fauxpas in my bookbr br and lastly the epilogue another scare tactic carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go and he says he doesnt know the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future starts at 2100 and it fails he keeps decrementing the years by 10 and trying again and by the fadeout hes at like 2030 or so throughout the movie carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years you would think in these enlightened times the church would have enlightened as wellbr br im glad i saw this movie while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough now i know it for a fact worth watching if you are not a christian to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie
