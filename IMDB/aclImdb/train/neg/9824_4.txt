not being familiar with us television stations when i flicked onto this on my inlaws cable first i thought it was just a lowbudget scifi film then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist and then it dawned on me  good grief these people are serious its been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers but then i saw other reviews and thought hey they can take it tough philosophical conundrum how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is youre criticizing answer make it in such a way that the only people wholl appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies youre criticizing i suppose some liberals ugh spit when you say that might be offended at the filmmakers contempt for those in the audience who arent obsessed with the j c myth but i didnt mind  it was so darn funny
