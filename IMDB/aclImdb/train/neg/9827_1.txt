first of all this movie reminded me of the old movies i used to have to watch in religion class in school thats not a good thing basically its just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth just like the terrible left behind series im not offended by religious movies but i am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful i would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it doesnt look like that will happen any time soon i bet if you gave the bible thumpers a decent budget they still wouldnt be able to come up with anything good just avoid this one also the fact that the american family association basically reverend wildmons lackies beam about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it in fact after i viewed this i went home and watched my copy of david cronenbergs nc17 rated crash forgive me father for i have sinned hahahahaha
