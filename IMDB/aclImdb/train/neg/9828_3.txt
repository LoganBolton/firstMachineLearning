i rented this by mistake i thought after a cursory examination of the box that this was a timetravelscifi story instead its a christian story and i suppose is fairly typical example if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plotactingetc but i found it rather painful br br i have to admit that im bothered by the rewriting of history in this story it paints the 1890s as some sort of paradise of family values and morality a character is aghast that 5 of marriages end in divorce but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this highly moral society rigid racial sexual and social discrimination were widespread for instance and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about womens clothing styles as reported in a recent wsjbr br overall thought i suppose that its the sort of thing youll like if you like this sort of thing and its certainly wholesome
