one of the more literate lone stars with time spent on character development and interaction dialog and acting business the opening scene sets the stage literally for the personalities of the gambler kansas charlie eddy chandler and his buddy john scott john wayne the rodeo say rohdayoh star both of whom are slightly randy the film follows their adventures as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman who has the inevitable evil brother though hed been led astray by the real villain and wants to repent and oh of course theyre being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the endbr br the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling marys butt in her grocery store and knocking away the ladder shes standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western but it sounds better than it actually is br br sadly the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here no yakima canutt cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses no george hayes tedious stoogelike biplay between scott and charlie with charlie swinging at scott scott stomping on his foot and then punching him repeated two more times the skilled paul fix is underused eddy chandler himself here in his big star turn is not really believable as a randy side kick the villain looks too old and fat so does chandler who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf mary kornman of the twenties our gang see mary queen of tots 1925 is cute in her scenes with john wayne but thats about it for this one seeds of a better western lie buried herebr br ps the ultrashort colorized version which looks good moves along so fast its over if you blink more than once thankfully though the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut
