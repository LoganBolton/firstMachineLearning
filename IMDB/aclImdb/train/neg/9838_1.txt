this movie is horrendous decent fight scenes or not the acting is really bad like you can tell theyre reading their lines from a card with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actors interactions weird pauses between different characters lines combined with hurried line delivery by others if the movie were all action this might be forgivable but a lot of the movie includes plot setup and family guy style irreverent cut aways oh wow are they badly done im assuming they were attempting to be funny with these but it again came off as a bunch of highschoolers college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip br br now to the fight scenes theyre not too bad considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film nothing great either certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated nothing like drunken master the fights have an overly staged feel with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved br br in sum the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guys friends involved with this very very cheap production which guy you may ask oh the same guy who wrote directed produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece
