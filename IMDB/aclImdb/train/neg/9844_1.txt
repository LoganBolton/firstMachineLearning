this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen im still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit clich√© they can think of arrrrghbr br don johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and wont stop lingering in my brain br br the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i wont ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie but i garantee you a nghya moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if youre forced to go on a date with someone you really dont like suggest watching this movie together and theyll probably leave you alone after they see it thats a fair price to pay i guess
