peter sellers plays dick scratcher haha a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one although hes witnessed a treasure being buried he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank thus dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts do you place an ad for that and help lead a path to the treasure its mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director and given medaks talents in the film the ruling class you can probably guess which of the grainy poorly lit scenes had milligan in the directors chair peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the films first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain hes probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned so that he can keep this off his resume franciosa looks dashing as the handsome powerbehindscratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate with even sellers makeup and hair looking quite terrible they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it with lines like these i can understand any possible uneasebr br pierre about to be hanged youll pay for thisbr br scratcher no i wont ill do it for freebr br and thats one of the good jokes its amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the wellreceived british tv program a show called fred starring sellers milligan and directed by the great richard lester
