this movie does have some great noirishneorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywoods sugarcoating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film but some of the scenes go on for much too long the wedding especially and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screenbr br the dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on most of the characters were either italianamericans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks toward the end i was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk but it absolutely did not work for mebr br another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason the main characters son born and raised in new york in the 1920s suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent im only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in englandbr br i give this movie an a for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution
