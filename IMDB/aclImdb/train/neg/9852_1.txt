discovery channelanimal planet must be ashamed of themselves this fantasy is modeled after the walking with dinosuars series even though this is 100 fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way even mixing the fantasy dragons with trexs and the extinction of the dinos added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say scifi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this showbr br on its own the show is about an 7510 far as entertainment goes but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 110 dont get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is realbr br i also think this weakens the great walking with dinosuars series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that miniseries
