let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan however this film is not for me many farfetched arguments are trying to support this films claim that dragons possibly ever existed the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility the film uses nice cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragons life this is combined with populartvshowcsistyle flashforwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not in many cases the argumentsclues are farfetched in some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesnt have it bottom line its a pretentious fantasycsi documentary not worth watching
