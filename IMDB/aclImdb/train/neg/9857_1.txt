i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at allbr br im an rpg gamer computer type none of the dnd tabletop stuff but i found none of the jokes in this funny at allbr br some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot tilt and zoom couldve been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in timebr br i think i laughed a total of 23 times in the entire moviebr br the acting itself wasnt all that bad around the standard that a b grade movie should havebr br id suggest not bothering with this movie unless youre a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it
