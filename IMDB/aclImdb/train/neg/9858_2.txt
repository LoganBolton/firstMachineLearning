this movie is not funny it just takes the dd nerd stereotypes and amplifies them all the main characters make less than 30k a year they all live with their parents theyre all socially retarded and they have no luck with women the jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on it was his wizard costume and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up oh how funny hes a nerd so he doesnt know about sports you may have to be a childish highschooler to find any of this stuff funny poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch but obviously extremely cheap to make i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly dangelo i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime
