as a gamer i cant say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social groupbr br to me there are several reasons whybr br 1 the characters seem unnatural ive met lots of players of all different walks of life i dont know any who act like any of the characters in the film its like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people most gamers are rather social people some with rather active livesbr br 2 the style doesnt work the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better while it is good looking ie cleanly put together it isnt very goodbr br 3 the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context gamers swear ill admit that but we dont have tourettes syndromebr br 4 the humor is lacking while selfdeprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups ive encountered this is less selfdeprecation and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of gamer humor is full of injokes and anecdotes not toilet humor most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokesbr br 5 the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i dont mean rules but instead dynamics invariably this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the gamers where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep thats definitely like gary
