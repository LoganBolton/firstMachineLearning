you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of timebr br all of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interestbr br this movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insultingbr br the movie is so meanspirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner youd have to hate yourself to enjoy itbr br the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality
