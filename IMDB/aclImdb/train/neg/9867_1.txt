saw a screener of this before last years award season didnt really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended but whatever maybe for exposure at the least but the movie was a convoluted mess sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all there was not one person that i could connect with and i think that is where it failed for me sure the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology wow what a grand idealets see if that already hasnt been mined to the point of futility the whole ordeal feels fake from the lighting the casting the screenplay to the horrible visual effectswhich is supposed to be intentional i can tell and so can everyone else no one is laughing with you though anyways i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least i wouldnt want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed but its tripe either way boring tripe at that
