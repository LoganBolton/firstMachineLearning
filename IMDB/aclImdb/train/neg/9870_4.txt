i had several problems with the movie br br 1 the screenplay  specifically kim basingers voice over movies are not books they should show the action rather than have a voice over tell us whats happening occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script in fact it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice overbr br 2 i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex carters acting was pretty bad thats a significant failure for me in defining jessies and thomas characters  with no connection between them it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sexdeprived if it had been properly done the relationship between them would have given much more context to the storybr br 3 with the book i understood jessies midlife crisis in the movie it seemed more like just plain boredombr br on the plus side i didnt think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv    though that thought did occur to me
