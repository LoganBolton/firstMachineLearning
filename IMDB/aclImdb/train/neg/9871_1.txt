and shot in vancouver with the mountains of the low country of south carolina visible in the background for heavens sake they should have reset the location there are no coastal mountains in south carolina periodbr br lame visuals they should have been beautiful and the story limped alongbr br i really dont understand why it was such a hit as a book although i have to admit its one i havent read as yet usually i read the book and give the film a miss there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book or even borrow it from the librarybr br verdict the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to moi
