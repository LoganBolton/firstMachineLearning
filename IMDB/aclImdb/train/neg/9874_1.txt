a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do that being stealing from farms and killing prey until a trio of farmers decide theyve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved they are of course out foxed at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers landbr br thefilm version and i use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely so kudos to them theyll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book
