i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it it was one of worst movies ive ever seen im a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie i would probably never talk to them again anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry hermit type personality im gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too just like the selfcentered fart bags who do the voices for the movie i know everyone has different types of humor some people may not even like mine but thats okay i dont think this covers any range of humor though this movie is as flat and dull as wes andersons mind go in and get ready to walk out its best to get your money back too
