after viewing the film i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdbbr br the fantastic mr fox is an adaption of a beloved childrens classic portraying the story of the smooth slick protagonist mr fox or foxy as he attempts one last heist to steal from the dreaded boggins bunce and bean thats right one short one fat one lean or however it goesbr br i dont quite know where to start with my criticismbr br well im in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl but i like his material well enough having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again this film however struggles for an audience is it aimed at children adults im still unsure many of the jokes would bore a child especially as mr fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor also an audience of im assuming children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens im all for the food chain but you practically see mr fox biting down on their necks surely thats a bit much and also the plot well its kind of boring i stayed only with the hope of it getting better but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisionsbr br the humour meanwhile falls flat i laughed only once or twice even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned the voice actors have no sense of comic timing instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums george clooney aims to portray mr fox as charming and sleek but his voice has no character meryl streep shows no emotion i didnt even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits and ash twelveyears old in foxyears sounds like hes about 30br br i love animation particularly stop motion but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit characters are tall spindly and lacking any warmth of design they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange there is also a distinctive mixed medium feel as 2d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully characters look straight at the camera and talked it was very awkward there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera didnt move and had swirls on his eyeballs it actually freaked me outbr br fantastic mr fox had so much potential lots of people still seem to like it  look at the reviews maybe it just wasnt for me
