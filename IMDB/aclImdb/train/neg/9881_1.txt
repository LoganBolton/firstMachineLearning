bo dereks debut film remained unseen for eight years  and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema  not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only 16 when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set  but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious br br the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness  hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier  she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record the couple are married by the end of the filmbr br also involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason were even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy 1931 at the end of the day while bos naivete throughout is undeniably charming its not enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness
