there are exactly 2 good things to be said about fantasies both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well br br a bo dereks extraordinary poetryinspiring beauty she has shots in this movie where she gives even catherine zetajones a run for her money and thats a high compliment indeed her nudity is brief and discreet but just looking at her face is enoughbr br b the greek island setting with its sun and crystalclear blue watersbr br other than that there is no story the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny he touched you where youre a woman and peter hootens character is a slimy jerk bo overplays the naivete of her character but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad its unfair to blame the actors the fact that she kept saying the name damir in almost every sentence is a major irritation oh and although the film is set on a greek island there is hardly a greek word to be heard  apparently everyone there from kids to old people speaks english the whole time
