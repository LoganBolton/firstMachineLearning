this is peter falks film periodbr br i was 10 years old when this film came out i was already a film maven at the time of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out but i was in love with the typeface of its ads  the aura that this was an important film okay 34 years later ive finally seen the filmhaving never seen any cassavetesdirected film previously hes a hack overall zero sense of timing editing genas performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffmans stint in rain man technically on par but entirely onenote as tom cruise stole rain man falk takes the cake for this filmbr br i was annoyed with genas performance really throughoutit seemed better suited for awakenings blecch its not all her fault shes a basket case from first scene to last we never find out why but falks character seems real  is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed manbr br shave off at least an hour an editor needed and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple cromagnon man coming to grips with a wife who doesnt work  yet cannot deal with her three kids  her husbands long hours of workbr br id rather remember cassavetes for the dirty dozen or rosemarys baby he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excessas he amply demonstrates with this filmbr br bob
