this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesnt succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull longwinded dribble they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i cant believe what a laughable movie this was br br and im very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing nc17 movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens pathetic
