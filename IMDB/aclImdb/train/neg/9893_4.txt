i only hope that no classicistsancient historians saw cleopatra or if they did that they took it as a laugh the movie is horrendously inaccurate more laughably even than gladiator which is at least a wellwritten script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story most blatant is octavius caesars heir in the senate before caesars assassination at the ripe old age of 19br br besides this the acting is mediocre timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says caesar julius caesar billy zane is a laughably dense marc antony and leonor varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh who in real life was not goodlooking at all but comes off as unbelievablebr br so this is a warning for all historiansthis movie is not true to life
