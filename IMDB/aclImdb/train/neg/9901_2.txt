this really should have been a one star but there was so many clich√©s predictable twists seen it all before slasher flick parallels that i actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laughalthough this was never the directors intention im surebr br i dont often write comments about films they have to be either sensational or in this ones case really badbr br to be honest as soon as i saw jeff fahey in it i knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst filmsbr br somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t not relay mr t but youll know what i mean if you bother to watch this if you do watch it make sure you dont pay to see it this may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it but im sure youll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all
