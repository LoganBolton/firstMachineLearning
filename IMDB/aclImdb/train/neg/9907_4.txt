dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night doublebill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script cowritten by the wild bunchs walon green jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast harvey keitel warren oates valerie perrine tony richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then  but now it doesnt even turn up on tv the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with nicholsons border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wifes relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the films trailersbr br while that probably wasnt too convincing considering how lowkey nicholsons crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity at one point hes holding characters at gunpoint then hes somewhere else and theyre free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrines character gets dumber on an exponential level the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring unfortunately ry cooders beautiful title song across the borderline says it all much more economically but if you want to know the films real crime its completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part when even he cant make an impression you know somethings really wrong all in all all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time
