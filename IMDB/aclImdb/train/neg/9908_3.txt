i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10  because the stories are openended and left unexplained and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way plus scenes of a decaying corpse br br neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic mannerbr br the films plot such as it is concerns three loosely interconnecting stories none of which conclude satisfactorilybr br the bounty hunter played by bruce dern is the character that connects all three vignettesbr br first we have dylan mcdermott looking darn fine as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he rides through a border town and spots a sadfaced saloon girl played by helen huntbr br then we have one of the hemingway girls not sure which one playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman an attractive redhead whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too longbr br the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension
