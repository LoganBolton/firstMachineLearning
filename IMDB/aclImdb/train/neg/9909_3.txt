this was not a well done western youve got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it killing people for his own reasons youve got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten then youve got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there what is the point of this film couldnt bruce dern find something better to do this was a waste of film
