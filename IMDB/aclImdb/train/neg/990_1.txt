do not waste your time or your money on this movie my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave so we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldnt be that bad it was i cant believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just cant make yourself i honestly feel emotionally scarred it went from being a semilow budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy shes dating to an all out porno flick and really not a good one i went from hating the womans rapist to almost feeling bad for him almost all in all an awful movie that was definitely rated nc17 for a reason dont waste your money and dont let your kids watch it
