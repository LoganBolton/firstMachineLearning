i just finished dark chamber aka under surveillance and im stunned stunned not by the film but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it the story was so ravaged by plotholes and the majority of the acting so flat categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate seriously i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this moviebr br justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killeraddicted mom to go live with his cop father despite moms warnings that dad is no good when a young woman is found murdered justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments with the help of a couple pals he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks as the truth begins to unravel justin uncovers an unexpected secretbr br one positive point is that felissa rose is hot i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit but no such luck it would have been the films potential saving grace eric conley played justin very adeptly i thought and i wouldnt be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future br br the general premise of the film although plagued by clich√©s might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members most notably alexandra eitel kayla and david h rigg justins father the horror pardon the punbr br i have nothing against lowbudget films indeed i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come ill cut lowbudget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects lighting even musical score and the overall picture quality i dont give allowances however for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lovers script there are a vast number of competentlymade low budget films out there sadly this isnt one of them i cant help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way affiliated with its production
