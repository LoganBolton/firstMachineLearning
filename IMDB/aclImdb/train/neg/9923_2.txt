as i write this review in 2008 we are mired in a remake culture movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including king kong the wicker man and practically every film that ever starred michael caine this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon however as dough for the dodo proves an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampetts surreal masterpiece porky in wackyland dough for the dodo sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampetts original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampetts source material although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampetts inspired insanity inevitably then dough for the dodo is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached for cartoon fans like myself its equivalent to a colorization of casablanca
