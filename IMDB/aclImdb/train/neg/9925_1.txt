this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles itself brilliant but not this nowhere did i see mel brooks name on here and i can guess why hes got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot my gawd who would find this funny sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasnt funny well cause its simply not funny its like the writers didnt even try to be funny just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot flat out they didnt care it was a quick cash cow which thank god didnt cash out i guess its useful for historical purposes only or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be
