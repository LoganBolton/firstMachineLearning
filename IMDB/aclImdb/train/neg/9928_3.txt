to review this movie i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantinos pulp fiction 1994 when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living jules tells vincent that the only thing she did worthwhile was pilot vincent asks what the hell is a pilot and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is well the way they make shows is they make one show that shows called a pilot then they show that show to the people who make shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if theyre going to make more shows some pilots get picked and become television programs some dont become nothing she starred in one of the ones that became nothing now to stretch on what jules was talking about there are billions of television showspilots that were never aired because they simply were notwell good probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is walter a spinoff to mash with gary radar burghoff as the lead hmmm would somebody really want to be watching radar for a halfhour trying to solve crimes hence the show was never picked up what many people dont know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide some have made theyre way past and got onto the air the pilot for the animated series american dad comes to mind as the shows serial itself didnt begin until nearly four months later however there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air and this here is whybr br black bart a supposed tiein with the mel brooks comedy classic blazing saddles is a stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul saddles was a controversial comedy nevertheless with its racist humor and vulgar comedy which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv i say supposed because none of the memorable characters from the movie aside from bart on in this mess of a tv show mel brooks wasnt even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line in a related story i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie clerks that kevin smith was no involved inyou see what happensbr br set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west named appropriately black bart who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr obviously before his stint in real acting whereas in this he is playing a grated richard pryor most of the other characters are carbon if not really bad copies of the characters in the movie jim the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer a more of a ripoff of the character being that shes a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrichtype accent and personality while thats pretty much the end in similarities the lead bad guy in the story is fern malaga played by noble willingham who i assumed wouldve been hedley lamar if warner bros secured the rights to the name see trivia for blazing saddles and his son curleyi dunno taggart i suppose the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom much less a pilot bart deals with the mayors drunk son and hes outofcontrol behavior which has caused the town to spin really its a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and doesnt focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show i cant really call it a sitcom and even if i wanted to and thats primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros studios and later added a laugh track so the show is set up almost exactly like mash complete with a bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series the acting is soso but theres one part that always make me laugh and thats when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue ha the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie surprisingly they use the word ner numerous amount of times through a 22minute episode rather touchy for its time period and even for today and it gets repetitivebr br if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of ssssssurly interesting novelty item watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots its on the collectors edition of blazing saddles god knows why there yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tiein pilots never air
