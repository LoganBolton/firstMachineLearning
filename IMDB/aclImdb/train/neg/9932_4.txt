dan duryea a perfectly decent bmovie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s cant do much with this one young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer when hes sentenced to die his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead womans husband after a dazzling opening shot flick quickly settles into bmovie formula it certainly looks good but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast including peter lorre and broderick crawford is just a bit stiff based on a cornell woolrich novel and passable for a single viewing br br  from
