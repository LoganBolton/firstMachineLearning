it utterly defeats me why godard is taken so seriously  and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an intellectual polemicist its hard to credit that godard actually believed all that marxist and maoist kant anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those isms and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them as a filmmaker ask yourself would you have boring voiceovers reading tedious political diatribes at your audience and then when you couldnt think of anything else to do layer another voiceover to the first voiceover which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case brilliant jeanluc as for godard insisting on making a film with the rolling stones of course he did wouldnt you it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place the genius of the stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera the bookshop scene wasnt worthy of even the worst fringe theatre and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it  as could be readily seen coppingout by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream filmmaking is no more than a safe getout to offer those who clearly see godards poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience ironic that godards onetime great friend truffaut with nuit americain made the best film about filmmaking ever and godard made the worst with le mepris incidentally godard didnt choose the stones track of sympathy with the devil it just happened to be the track they were working on when the film started shooting at barnes olympic studios
