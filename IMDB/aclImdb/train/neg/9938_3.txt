jean luc godards marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as youre likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker bits of political theater mindnumbingly boring and interminable are interspersed with the making of sympathy for the devil featuring the rolling stones in the studiobr br the process of the songs development from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end is fascinating and its worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones almost half the movie is devoted to this so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song togetherbr br when i had this on laserdisc i valiantly attempted to watch it all but i dont see how anyone could get through it i finally gave up and just chapterskipped my way to the stones segments
