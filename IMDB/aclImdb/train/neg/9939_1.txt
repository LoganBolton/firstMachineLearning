the filmschool intellects can drool all they want about the important imagined meaning of this film but its just that intellectual drool this film is creatively bankrupt and some mistake its endless selfindulgent wanking as substance yeah br br obviously godard wasnt a stones fan too bad because this could have been great hes capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective mag or some such crap br br then theres the endless shots of what looks like 60s librarians spraypainting words on peoples cars and then theres the seemingly neverending interview where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions theres some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book which goes on for oh only about 20 minutes and black panthers or something in a junkyardbr br it almost sounds intriguing well its notbr br but for unwashed filmschool hipsters who dont care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mags this films a real winnerbr br more accuratelymaybe godard just blows
