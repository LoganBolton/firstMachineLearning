the cover art which features a man holding a scary pellet gun would make it seem as if its a martial arts film hardlybr br i find it interesting that the films real title is trojan warrior trojan is a brand of condoms in the us this movie is loaded with homoeroticism if you like that stuff then this film isnt that bad really however consider these pointsbr br there are numerous closeups of actors groins  butts one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime peach and red from a cinematographers standpoint this movies a drag queen several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another occasionally touching as they converse also the cousin of the hero likes women and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey br br shall i go into the fight scenes yes someones private parts get grabbed in one fight the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative no fancy stuff here just your standard moves youd see in an old chuck norris flick theres also a car chase scene which may be the first ever lowspeed chase put on film
