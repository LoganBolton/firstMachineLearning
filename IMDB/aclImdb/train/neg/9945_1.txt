after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar  i found myself constantly switching through tvchannels to see what else is on  not exactly a good movie traitbr br this movie is listed as being in a number of genres and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them 80 through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead bottom line  the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didnt exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste
