spoilers hereinbr br my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than australian kickboxings favorite son stan the man longinidis the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and noone else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kickboxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australias greatest kickboxer he said that he wasnt a sellout he was happy and a retiree he wasnt ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film yes you heard right he plugged his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called trojan warrior this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight for nowbr br stan plays ajax a kickboxing exspecial forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne ajaxs cousin theo arthur angel recently sold out well at least stan didnt stray too far away from everything to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party its all pretty ridiculous but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again br br ill admit i was actually pumped to see this i love action films even if theyre corny and especially if its set in my own backyard but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of god please make it stop subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most overchoreographed fight scenes that didnt even remotely reflect stans actual talent in kickboxing the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous dermot brereton mark chopper read and greg matthews the whole time youre sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on splitsecond appearances by former celebrities remember those plotholes i told you about ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for buggery this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to ajax that his wife isnt actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now thats a marriage br br amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as a cross between jackie chan  guy ritchie has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing well anything and guy ritchie is the crimefilm messiah and youre comparing him to salik silverstein this film is more like a mix between pizza and enter the ninja br br now where do you thing the whole trojan warrior title comes from ajaxs fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior no the gangsters unification to find theo like that of the trojan empire no its because wait for it theo carries a condom around with him yes that right because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket he is a trojan warrior br br i had the displeasure of seeing trojan warrior on dvd as well as its special features br br  video clip of chop chop a rap song by mark chopper read chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their australian accents face it people rap was developed in the states leave it there the clip looked like something a channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together br br  bloopers there was no real difference between these and the actual film br br  stan the man longinidis kickboxing featurette this wasnt too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montagebr br i dont want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but oh wait i just did my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of trojan warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad
