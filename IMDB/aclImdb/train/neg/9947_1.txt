this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie icet was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when icet is on that hill and uses that spaz15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take 1000s of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldnt blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel
