this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies but youd think that even the homeless and urbandwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide and upon reaching the hunting grounds poor icet plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods hes never seen beforebr br and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattlebr br im assuming this movie was based on richard connells short story the most dangerous game a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story i reedited the movie cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity it ended up being 43 minutes long
