johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts minus the fangs of course theyre dark bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery through their charms namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet respectively they seduce desperate souls who they proceed to torment and victimize thats more or less the basis of this black comedy as i understand itbr br its not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy main character i did enjoy however the sound and the melody of the rapidfire and supposedly very witty remarks i was very impressed by the casts strong acting particularly david theliss only the character of jeremy seemed too bidimensional the photography and the music both dramatic and somber work very well together br br what really turns me off about naked and the main reason id never recommend it to anyone is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent ones angst in other words in a world that sucks so bad what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls right to suggest as some have on this website that johnny is not so unkind a person because hes not as rough on girls as jeremy seems completely absurd to me theyre both terrible nasty people and theyre particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass but still his and jeremys sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter and i could be wrong but im guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical
