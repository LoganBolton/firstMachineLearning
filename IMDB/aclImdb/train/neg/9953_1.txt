i really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that i despise however my history speaks i must not tell a lie bobby deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels i never thought that i would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did al pacino isnt acting in this film hes posing there are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just staring at the camera hes perfectly awful marthe keller is just as bad these two are supposed to be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever sydney pollack directed this film theres no trace of the genius behind tootsie here is this the same man i cheered for in eyes wide shut i can hardly believe it save yourself a horrible movie experience run dont walk away from bobby deerfield
