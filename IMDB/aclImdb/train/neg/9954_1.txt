from beginning to end this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about nothing i have ever seen the characterizations and interactions between the title character and marthe kllers character are pure torture the racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche yet director pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly importantbr br maybe theres some value for a msft3000 replaying of some of the scenes such as pacino getting in touch with his inner female for goof value but even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey
