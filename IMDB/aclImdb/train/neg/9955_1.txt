the entire thing is very beautiful to look atthe european location shooting was a good idea the lead actors are attractive the score is servicablebr br but then they spoke and the nonplot developed and it was all downhill from there pacino is sleepwalking and keller keeps talking about how bored she ishello dear youre not alone when he does a mae west imitation you might have to hide your face its that painful to watchbr br i cant imagine how either actor or director sydney pollack got involved with this or a better question why it ended up stinking so badbr br since death is represented in almost every scene one way or another maybe youre supposed to have low enjoyment here maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death but i still cant recommend it
