one of the most peculiar oftused romance movie plots is this one a seriously messedup man falls in love with a terminally ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent weepie but more frequently its done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as youre telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks arent affected one bit and since this is the 70s neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together and theyre played by actors who are completely at seabr br this has got to be the worst performance of al pacinos career and i say that after having seen the devils advocate only two days ago he plays a controlfreak emotionally constipated racecar driver and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly he seems to constantly be asking himself why hes staying around the grating marthe keller so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that hes changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventiesbr br marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms keller who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype you vill eat ze omelet than anything like lovable shes supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesnt work that way its more like shes harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you cant believe shed be with someone she finds so worthless and you cant believe hes with someone who gets on his nerves that muchbr br some badmovie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of pacinos silly liberating mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if youre a serious badmovie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but pacinos other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isnt one of those laughaminute bad movies like the conqueror its just a really really bad moviebr br
