rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly unhollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldnt find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know shes on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didnt seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but cant cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with mewhat can i say this may click with you it may not for me its time i cant get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned theres several real reasons why this is nc17 and rosario please youre a better actress pick better scripts
