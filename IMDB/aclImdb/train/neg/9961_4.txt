amelia and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other amelia has a longtime lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute that doesnt satisfy him the two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the endbr br theres not a whole lot to this particular short the direction is straightforward and dramatic which is good the acting is sincere but the story leaves a little bit to be desired why exactly do we care about these two people its a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that its much more pared down and doesnt search for meaning in it a welcoming change of pace if anythingbr br i dont know its possible i dont connect to these stories because ive never experienced them but i have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same ie a couple talking together while avoiding eyecontact by pretending to be immersed in magazines etc the nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different and id like to see a different takebr br polarisdib
