uta hagens respect for acting is the standard textbook in many college theater courses in the book hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the presentational approach and the representational approach in the presentational approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actors own life in the representational approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and soundbr br the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made british theater has a long history of this style of acting and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational schoolbr br time has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach to the modern eye oliviers highly enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy stiff and stilted instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet olivier made a declaiming selfimportant bullhorn out of the melancholy dane  an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamletbr br and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today oliviers tendency to enunciate makes some of hamlets lines unintentionally funny instead you must acquire and beget a tempurrance that may give it smoothness instead of crying at meeting his fathers ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in oliviers pupils give us that impressionbr br eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet putting in a good essay at the queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41 she was 26 the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given oliviers tendency to want to keep the camera on him at all times br br sixty years later you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable flawed hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn final analysis i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it
