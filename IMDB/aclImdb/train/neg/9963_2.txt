i love alec guinness and thats saying a lot after this film actually he is not bad in it he just seems to stand aside be urbane and his usual delightful self but invest nada it is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight even as an inexperienced young french girl sir alec wouldnt have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isnt too happy about it nowbr br the interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd suzanne another twit donald aspires to be a french heathcliffe and i waited in vain for the source of his mystery what deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead was he in love with the fathers mistress why did he jerk suzannes hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious actingbr br the film would have been charming with guiness and the older woman reminiscing and seeing paris together that would have been a great story two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of world war ii why didnt somebody come up with that i suggest watching alec guiness in the card a little known but worthwhile film
