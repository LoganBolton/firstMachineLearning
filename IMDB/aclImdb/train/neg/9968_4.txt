as an exteacher i must confess to cringing through many scenes  though i continued to watch to the end i wonder why boredom perhaps br br the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mishmashed and unfocussed the plot too although there were some good ideas  the plight of a relief teacher for example  were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3d developmentbr br not one of mr noltes finer moments as to young mr macchio does he speak that way in every moviebr br plot and acting complaints aside the hairstyles alone were a nostalgic if nauseating tripbr br
