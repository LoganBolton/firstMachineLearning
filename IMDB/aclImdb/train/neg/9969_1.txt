i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film i wasnt drawn in for even a second the characters were all onedimensional they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick i would bet and hope that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment there are some great actors here but you would never know it thank god it didnt destroy morgan freemans or judd hirshs or nick noltes or laura derns careers there was no vision no labor of love here only a horrible effort gone wrong btw i dont think the writer ever set foot in a real school
