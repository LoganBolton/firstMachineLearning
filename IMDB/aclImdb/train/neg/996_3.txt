revenge is one of my favorite themes in film moreso the futility of revenge is one of my favorite themes in film having seen gaspar noes irreversible 2002 i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme instead this film is a weak halfhearted attempt which expressed nothing but the films lack of conviction and focusbr br spoilers the end scene a gratuitous maleonmale rapetorture scene came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy however the film doesnt even follow through with this instead the drawn out scene which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized is crowned with a shot of dawsons face in an expression of either regret or this didnt fix anything while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the backgroundbr br my problem with the scene wasnt one of shock but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience i mean do we feel bad for the rapist do we rejoice in dawsons revenge are we disgusted by the brutality of it all do we feel dawsons moment of regretful clarity aside from this failing the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance characters are thin dialog is monotonous etcbr br normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didnt really seem to know what those were thumbs down
