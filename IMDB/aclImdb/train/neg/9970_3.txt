people who actually liked problem child 1990 need to have their heads examined who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny the movie is not funny ever in any way beginning to end it wants to be a cartoon but the writers dont realize that slapstick isnt funny when people get attacked by bears or hit with baseball bats it may be funny in cartoons but not in a motion picturebr br the films young hero is junior michael oliver who since he was a baby has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption the families reject him because junior tends to give them a hard timebr br he is then thrown into an orphanage where he terrorizes the nuns and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bowtie killer michael richards he is soon adopted by ben and flo healy the late john ritter and his wife amy yasbeck who are dying to have a child in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhoodbr br junior becomes a member of the healy household and little ben takes an interest in him despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site or throws a cat at his father big ben jack warden a bigoted politicianbr br i think that were supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people his new mother flo is a bitch his grandfather is completely selfish and one little girlwho despises adopted kidsis such a spoiled bratbr br but what junior does to get the last laughs isnt funny its mean cruel and sometimes lifethreateningbr br and what is the films message that kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers they definitely dont what its like to be a bad kid junior isnt a onehes just a sadistic little twerp there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others now everybodys laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball batbr br its a shame that this movie has been marketed as a family comedy whats worse is that problem child is rated pg what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this theres a lot of profanity and meanspirited pranks here that one may wonder about the dividing between the pg and the pg13br br kids will enjoy this but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen and to most people problem child will be considered a guilty pleasure classic a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking even though the prevailing opinion as put forth by more serious viewers is that the movie is a piece of crap
