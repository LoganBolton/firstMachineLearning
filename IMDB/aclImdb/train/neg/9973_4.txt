problem child is one of the goofiest movies ever made its not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but its not the best either its about a devilish 7yearold boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple john ritter amy yasbeck who foolishly adopts him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i dont buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film its asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really dont know why but i cant recommend this film i know im being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that its better than the sequel which was just awful br br  out of four
