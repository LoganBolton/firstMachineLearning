i have to admit ive caught this one a few times on the usa network theres just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever its on yes youre right about the subpar acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i cant help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel
