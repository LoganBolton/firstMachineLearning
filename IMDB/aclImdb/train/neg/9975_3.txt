i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid and there were parts of it many in fact that i did not understand i think i have seen it once as an adult and i then understood those parts the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all so what kind of movie is this is it a kids movie not hardly it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children maybe but then why wouldnt it focus more on john ritters character instead of junior when a film has a 7yearold as its main character in order to do well with its audience it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate even 8yearolds wouldnt want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them im pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market
