the first scene in problem child has a baby peeing into a nuns face for this movie thats witty a nasty meanspirited comedy its inept on so many levels it beggars belief john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of onenote annoying performances and puerile humour and what the hells jack warden doing in this mess slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when its done with the crudity the movie is made so badly its quite a bizarre experience but never mind all that the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen Â– believe me you will want to smack him right in the mouth
