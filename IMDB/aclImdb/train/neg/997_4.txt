having just recently reviewed lipstick for the first time in a few decades i backed it with descent even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as minebr br its interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years from the fullon gore of i spit on your grave to the tawdry sensationalism of lipstick to the tasteful handling of the issue in the accused but descent though making some important points never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning no descent is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make  a message that when examined closely isnt that groundbreakingbr br i pretty much knew the plot going in what i wanted to see was the descent or degeneration of dawsons character being a big fan of rosarios i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twistedyou know the kind of portrayal deniro brings to taxi driver unfortunately the script and the directorwriters choices dont provide any sort of believable transitionbr br the biggest point of failure is the second act it became obvious what the filmmakers intentions were for this segment of clubhopping drug use and obsession with big black stallion adrian every white boys nightmare natch from a qa on the dvd but this excursion into dawsons character is never believably rendered we dont know exactly what the hell shes doing half the time what shes after or why shes doing it the poor quality of the audiovideo again dont help but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally welldone first act by the time we get to the finale our interest has already wanedbr br one point of success that dawson does point out in the qa is that by the end revenge scene we are pumped for retribution then realize just how drawnout and ugly the reality is while thats certainly valid it doesnt make the scene any more intriguingbr br if you have the dvd check out the deleted classroom scene this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation though all verbal and really does show dawsons slow crackup materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swifts prissy condescending dorm counselor if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violencebr br as the film stands in the final cut though all we get is what weve seen before only in a more graphic rendering so what
