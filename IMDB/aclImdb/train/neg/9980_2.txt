dont waste 90 minutes of your time on fast food fast women its annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing horrific acting and even bad music i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen she needs the fast foodbr br spend the 90 minutes youd devote to this turkey doing something more excitinglike trimming your toenails youd have more entertainment valuebr br the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser but she deserves much better than this tired script its as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the moviebr br viewer beware
