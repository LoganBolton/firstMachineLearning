this film is a massive yawn proving that americans havent got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 810 it isnt just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce
