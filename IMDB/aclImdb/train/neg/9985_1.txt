have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to outdo it the cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career even the many charms of ms diaz dont provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid its obviously a style of film that americans havent really got a grasp of watch the final result if you must and youll see what im talking about but dont say i didnt warn you
