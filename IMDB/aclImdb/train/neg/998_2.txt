its pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraphlong plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the bleep was going on alas to no availthis movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story its like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations newsflash to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody ive never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didnt really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasnt into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something dont book yourself as the lead if you cant act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the whitelatino issueyes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white collegeage males who wear baseball hats thats what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the storys antagonist as for the maya character she didnt seem like a real person anyway im ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made
