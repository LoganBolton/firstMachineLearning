first off im not here to dog this movie i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them although the monster itself is quite well doneimpressively well done at that he actually looks kind of otherworldly like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a  attending to natures call spot got loose and they just didnt have time to hunt him down that or hes the caucasian brother of the wishmaster i havent decided whichbr br actually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country yes but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere the trees and vistas say canada to me and its okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of ubercoldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china its a scifi channel movie so we can forgive the lack of locationbr br further apparently as we have just established scifi directors do not travel often as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened but as i said its a scifi channel movie so we must forgive a few thingsbr br the movie is pretty graphic at times and rotates between alive about the donner party predator about the alien in the woods and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires the yeti apparently can leap about like spidermanor super marioremember run faster jump higher live longer br br also the yeti has missed his teddy bear hes searched high and low for it but cannot seem to make a cadaver work poor yeti you cant help but feel sorry for it it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss hes missed his bear or maybe it wants to mate but that thought is banished do ya hear me well it does seem to be an unmated male rebanished br br and its superhuman well its not humanits superyeti but then again whats normalyeti i dont know but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling and hes got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur fabulous dahlink its spotlessly white at times when it so shouldnt be hes fastidiously superhusuperyetibr br all in all this was a lot of fun to watch has some great kills and a few honest plot elements in spite of the horribly gravellike production style this is actually quite entertaining i cant help wondering if theyre planning on another one br br it rates a 6010 on the m4tv scalebr br it rates a 4410 on the movie scale frombr br the fiend
