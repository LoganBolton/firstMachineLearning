hmmm a sports team is in a plane crash gets stranded on a snowy mountain and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive sound familiar anyone i refer to alive from 1993 the only major difference here of course is that a big white drunken scare crow of a yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead i guess humans taste better than yaksbr br stupid the man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the yeti nor does he have a backupbr br the plane crash is completely bogus it would have either exploded in the air exploded when it hit the ground or become obliterated the people would not have survived but hey its scifibr br stupid they survived and they are cold it might be a good idea to harness some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death fire being warm as it isbr br wtf the pilot has frost formed all over his face while hes alive and talking but oddly enough no one else doesbr br stupid one of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters but there are scattered parts of the plane on fire all around thembr br stupid they find coats and hoodies and yet there in the cold of the himalayas they fail to use the hoodsbr br stupid theyre staring at a pile of sticks when i reiterate there are pieces of the plane already burningbr br stupid the himalayas are notorious for its storms it would be common sense for them to collect the debris in order to reinforce their structure rather than sitting outside bickering there are a lot of pine trees around the branches of which make excellent insulationbr br wtf when in doubt use a dead mans arm as a splintbr br wtf if the one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels bears and leopards in the himalayas then why doesnt he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start br br stupid when attempting to trap wild animals mindless conversation in the vicinity of said trap always helpsbr br wtf do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass br br wtf the group was ready and armed to fight the yeti while the other two were standing there defenseless the yeti ripped out the guys heart and stomped the girls head and the gang did nothing theres lovebr br so two yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever or so we think mwuhahahaa the story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes as usual nice thinking with the javelin and the chain although this is some ingenuity with the magicallyappearing chain that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they couldnt even make fire despite the fact that it was all around thembr br as is typical for the scifi originals the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them not to mention they ate human flesh and havent brushed their teeth in several daysbr br the very end however is quote lame
