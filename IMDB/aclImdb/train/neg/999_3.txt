i saw descent last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and being a fan sounds pervy im not of raperevenge flicks of the 70s i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out my conclusion lets stick to the classics yes the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat the actors unconvincing even dawson is empty some would say that its a right depiction of the college world in the us that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity i wasnt expecting anything irreversiblestyle but still arent we suppose to feel compassion for her i didnt not for a minute she was so lame all the way  and i read that the photography was impressive well it is good indeed but nothing groundbreaking either i must admit that the screening at the festival wasnt so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie i couldnt help thinking i feel like watching argentos inferno again lol more seriously the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the americancanadian border in lynchs twin peaks  fire walk with me the crude red and blue lighting the heavy bass music the general lasciviousdecadent atmosphere no i just couldnt get into this movie too bad
