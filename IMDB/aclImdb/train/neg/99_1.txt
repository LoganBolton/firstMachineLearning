some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good  23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chroniclesbr br the only positive thing i can say about this film is that its nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelkbr br its been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks youve seen it all alreadybr br bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping tripbr br awful awful stuff weve all made stuff like this when weve gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid
