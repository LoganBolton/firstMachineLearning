the night listener 2006 12 robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner br br hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a standout lowkey performancebr br what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm br br in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talkradio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories hes penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no ones editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself br br no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he didnt anticipatebr br written by armistead maupin who cowrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the films novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned potboiler does it helps that williams gives a standout lowkey performance as the conflicted goodhearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the corebr br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for
