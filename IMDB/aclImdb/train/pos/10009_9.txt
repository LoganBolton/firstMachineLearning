when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywoodbr br writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifejess and the world around himdonnabr br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forwardbr br its to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didnt work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of artbr br oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the 1940s leading man looks and screen presence its this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right nowbr br s
