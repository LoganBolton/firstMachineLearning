i enjoyed the night listener very much its one of the better movies of the summerbr br robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believablebr br its a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the moviebr br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it wellbr br do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointedbr br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination but this is a minor quibble
