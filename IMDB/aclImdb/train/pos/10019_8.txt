when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky and ill complain about anything and everything that is done wrong while every movie has its flaws the night listener had an exceptionally low countbr br if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the posters reason for disdain heshe does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crackapparentlybr br so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director lets go over a quick checklist first 1 great plot absolutely i wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such the story really will amaze you even more so because its true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual eventsbr br 2 wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy typecast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case ofwell ill let you see for yourselfbr br 3 excellent direction certainly now unlike the other poster to which i referred i actually know something about direction ive been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years of course i really dont think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevantfor example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lolbr br patrick stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those sosoughtafter feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fastpaced camerawork and quick cuts were so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all seebr br 4 lighting cinematography and editing great all around ive already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so ill just wrap it upbr br in short go see this movie dont listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if theyre so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 14 of the way through their post enjoy the show ben
