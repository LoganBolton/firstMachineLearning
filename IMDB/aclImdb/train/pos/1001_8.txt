somewhat funny and wellpaced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fasttalking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding us treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thiefhacker doug hutchinson who stole fortytwo million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot deadbr br bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesnt top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flatout excellentbr br foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost
