previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and im a guy in his 60s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 70 rating by imdbcom usersbr br well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while 290 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 107 gave it a 1 rating these 107 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 70 br br in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc everyone has and is entitled to hisher own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 70 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picturebr br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point heavens gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 232 10 ratings and 92 1 ratings overall rating of 61 big top peewee 1988 got 43 10 ratings and 99 1 ratings overall rating of 45 cat people 1982 got 61 10 ratings and 26 1 ratings overall rating of 58 blind date 1987 got 30 10 ratings and 28 1 ratings overall rating of 53 jumpin jack flash 1986 got 44 10 ratings and 37 1 ratings overall rating of 52 what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower  than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got 107 1 ratings compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentionedbr br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factorbr br
