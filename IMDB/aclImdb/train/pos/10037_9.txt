the ship may have sunk but the movie didnt director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which roses family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the onei hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husbandbr br jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but its good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good riskbr br the movie is long but its fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it
