titanic has to be one of my alltime favorite movies it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyablebr br when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont i know so many people who dont like this movie and im not saying i dont see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist but this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expectedbr br and finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things its like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good moviebr br well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogybr br i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epicbr br i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructedbr br i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit itbr br i give this movie 1010 not because i like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events
