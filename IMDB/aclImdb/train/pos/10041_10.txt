back in 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 599 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardos real nose ok i know thats silly to say but i did rewatch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyagebr br the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank 101yearold rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in 1912 the upperclass 17yearold rose boards the ship with her fianc√© cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewittbukater debts

however after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the shipbr br they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting

rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose downbr br so does titanic live up to its hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a wellwritten story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one daybr br 1010
