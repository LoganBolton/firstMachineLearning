i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasnt that bad or else people wouldnt even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many br br as for those that think that this film is overrated or overhypedwell we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that lol you see its not criticsarticle writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general moviegoing public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe lets face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched br br give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movienot once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldnt say that this movie was overhypedat least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didnt even think that titanic would make enough money to cover camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more br br personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone dont say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing ive ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but lets face itthe real star of the movie wasnt leo or kateit was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job its not thier best work ive seen much better work from both of them but it wasnt the worst ive seen on screen before give them a breakbr br
