i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards  even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought ill give it a look see i didnt want to like it  and i didnt i loved it what a great moviebr br where to start first  the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then  the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent  winslets being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then  the details im no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then  the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes onbr br problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats br br a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressivebr br 910
