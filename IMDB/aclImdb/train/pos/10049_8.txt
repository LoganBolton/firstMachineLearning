i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every characters heartaches and painsbr br this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again im sorry for those that dont understand the value of love family and friendshipbr br it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006br br this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldnt be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire familybr br i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life
