after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be hauntedbr br 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clich√©d story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shockerbr br the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at thatbr br after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wallbr br for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own housebr br once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the filmtheres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the pointbr br the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationshipbr br although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isnt worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free
