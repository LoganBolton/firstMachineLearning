i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from 1968 i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black  white i knew my erotic hopes were dashedbr br boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance  the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end  but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black  white the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars essy persson and anna gael are intense and memorable ok so theyre both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls its 1968 do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too muchbr br i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shownbr br i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it wont be all you expect i dont think youll be too too disappointed
