verhoevens movie was utter and complete garbage hes a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratchbr br heinlein would have never supported that trash if hed been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some ta so the average idiot american moviegoer doesnt get boredbr br this anime isnt perfect but its at least mostly accurate as best i can tell
