this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english subtitling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which timeperiod it is set  there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 yearsbr br but then we briefly see a motor car  late 30s early 40s style  and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolutionbr br which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignantbr br but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendshipbr br maybe im reading too much into this film but i dont think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality materialbr br but dont get me started on that
