robert a heinleins classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoevens 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoevens film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinleins death and believe it or not despite its differences this 6part animated series is plotwise the most faithful adaptation of heinleins classicbr br the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoevens film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the books plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but its only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but its far superior to the film heinleins political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugsaliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film versionbr br overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look
