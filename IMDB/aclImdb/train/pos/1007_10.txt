ok lets get this clear im really not into scifi but for some reason i love stargate sg1 br br jack oneil takes his team sg1 through a stargate a round device that creates a wormhole it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual scifiseries but its not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other scifiseries i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets they have some of course but thanks to oneil who likes to keep a simple terminology theres not many br br the series has a nice blending of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects youre not going to find it here they dont use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects
