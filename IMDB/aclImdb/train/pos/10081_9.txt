this is a beautiful rich and very wellexecuted film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very maledominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and societys traditional notionsbr br the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old mans emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the filmbr br the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the charactersbr br some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small
