i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 45 at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tianming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the filmbr br all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually selfexplanatorybr br i wont give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95 of the hollywood crap especially childrens films out therebr br cheersbr br ps there is a realoriginal king of masks who cancould do 12 masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks
