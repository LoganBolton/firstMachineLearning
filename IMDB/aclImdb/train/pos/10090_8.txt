i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue but was pleased to find a fastpaced script an underlying moral excellent portrayals from all the actors especially peter finch amazing special effects suspense and beautiful cinematographytheres even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work all the supporting players round it out and i do wonder who trained all those elephantsbr br speaking of the stonebuddha sequence you really can discern that its vivien leigh in the long shots her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylors the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walkbr br if you want a thoughtprovoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring spend a few hours with elephant walk
