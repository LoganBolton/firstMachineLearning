my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twentytwo when she made elephant walk remember im nine so the feelings arent sexual i just couldnt see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age shes almost seventyfour but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have livedbr br i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss taylors beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a wellmade point on human arrogance in the face of naturebr br all in all a wellspent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video
