one of the first ovas original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles a cyberpunk scifi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of nearfuture pollution in a dystopian societybr br the heroes of dominion are the tank police formed with a if we cant beat crime well get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch most if not all of these cops are borderline psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannonsbr br equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist buaku and his henchwomen the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard timebr br the animation is not state of the art but its very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominionbr br the english dubbing is again lots of fun the soundtrack of the english version is also very good i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of thatbr br anyway dominion tank police is great its japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy filled with completely overthetop characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously highly recommended
