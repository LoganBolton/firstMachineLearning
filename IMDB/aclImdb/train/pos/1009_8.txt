fact stargate sg1 is a cheesy scifi tv seriesbr br theres no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg1 remains a cheesy scifi tv seriesbr br stargate sg1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx arent nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isnt going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter eitherbr br but and this is where i really think stargate sg1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy scifi movie thats actually worse than a one hour tv episodebr br in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most moviesbr br and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg1 specialbr br i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caughtbr br so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg1 as yet another tacky scifi show dont stick with it and youll see what im talking about
