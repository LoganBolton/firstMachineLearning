scott bartletts offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema theres no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartletts opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a closeup human eye  recalls dave bowmans journey through the stargate the visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though were sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitorbr br there appears to be some confusion about the films release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldnt have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought  and please dont laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that couldnt possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
