i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it 5 or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musicalcomedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kysers mysteries would be a good examplebr br having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh obrien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads dont know if that was truebr br all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i havent seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
