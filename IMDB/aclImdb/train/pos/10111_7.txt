the haunted world of edward d wood jr isnt a particularly good documentary aesthetically its lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and incohesive but this adds to its charm i say this because its a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such theres really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall its worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but dont expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after woods own heart
