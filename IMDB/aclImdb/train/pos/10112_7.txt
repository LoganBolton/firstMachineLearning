i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings havent much changedbr br documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include vampira dolores fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory walcott and paul marco interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed ive seen all of woods films and theyre just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldnt say he was the worst director ever but hes down there do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didnt try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s still its of interest if youre a wood fan the best interviews are with vampira who tears wood apart and dolores fuller a long time girlfriend
