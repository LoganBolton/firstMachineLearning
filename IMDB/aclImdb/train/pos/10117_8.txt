the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the bosss daughter is not for all tastes but its still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery weve come to know so well through other films from this regionbr br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and ive been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan br br sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed
