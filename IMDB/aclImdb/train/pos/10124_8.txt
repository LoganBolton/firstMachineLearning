shinjuku triad society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm its a yakuzatriad picture involving cops versus japanese or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical debut takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and ones roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2 thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women bloodcurdling violence its certainly not as surreal as some of miikes most recent films but this is expected as hes trying out things that hes just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers its got all of those qualities and its also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fansbr br the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as a eastwoodesquire antiherohero whos become a detective and another whos become a gangster or a wouldbe one the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner karino takeshi caesar whos threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman whos just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie theres some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters which kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gangs penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it wont come offbr br if it doesnt add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have its par for the course of a film like this miikes goals are met though just met in his lowscale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters at the same time shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the miike oeuvre some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area theres even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr weenyburger miike and his writer dont have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like ichi or of course visitor q but theres enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and charactersbr br as the first entry of the black society trilogy as its called i was quite impressed and its a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema
