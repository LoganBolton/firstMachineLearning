this was the beginning of it all granted this is not friends at its best but this was the shows pilot lets not forget and not a bad one at that were introduced to the gang and central perk where our story begins even from this first episode we get a sign of the rossrachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says i just want to be married again and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monicajoey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back something else in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the socalled flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was keep watching first season is a blast
