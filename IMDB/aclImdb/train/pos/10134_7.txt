masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby julia anderson  ciff addison martin donovan are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road cliffs airbag works ok  he walks away with minor injuries unfortunately for abby hers didnt  she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car  doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body abbys life is saved just she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured  horribly disfigured from the burns cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin bersen thinks they should let abby die sue the car manufacturer  get rich while abbys mum pam linda sorenson wants to blame cliff get rich  save abby however abby has other plans of her ownbr br this american canadian coproduction was directed by rob schmidt whose only horror film previously was wrong turn 2003 which on its own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode  was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series while i didnt think right to die was the best masters of horror episode ive seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same  still doesnt come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution 2006 the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isnt anything new but it uses it effectively enough although id say its a bit uneven the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abbys life  the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory  twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart the characters are a bit clich√©d the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum  the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace  overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here  there where it loses its focus a bit  i wasnt that keen on the ambiguous endingbr br director schmidt does a good job  there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere  outandout blood  gore there are some fantastic special makeup effects as usual theres shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body  the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images  makeup effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser 1987  its sequels then theres the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with closeups of scalpels slicing skin open  him peeling it off the muscle  putting it into a cooler box very messy there are also various assorted body parts theres some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting nakedbr br technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant  as most masters of horror episodes it doesnt look like a cheap madefortv show which basically if the truth be told it is the acting was fine but theres no big names in this onebr br right to die is another enjoyable  somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene well worth a watch for those with the stomach
