this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he killem all they are often the victims screwfly solution prolife valerie on the stairs i dont remember the argentos episode in season 1 etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i dont know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like prolife or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking
