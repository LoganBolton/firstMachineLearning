i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this master really doesnt have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the seasonbr br the acting was good i dont know how he wrangled it but weve got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the seriesbr br i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the henpecked hubbybr br really good effort like ive said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future
