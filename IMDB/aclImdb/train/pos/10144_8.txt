but the fun is in the journeybr br i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several timesbr br yes its predictable and yes its a clich√© romantic comedy but the point is that its a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many waysbr br the dialog is deadon and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that panned it for being predictable  if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the waybr br great date movie great movie for a happy cry
