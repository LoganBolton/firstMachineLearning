id have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural iowa oregon virginia la etc are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian localebr br but if there ever were one deserving the top rating  10 on this site its this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one its also been done pretty often on the big screen with megastars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al  and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least 1012 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mindbr br not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre ive seen i caught it by chance on a midday friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week id never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman annas mother whom id seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlies best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders br br the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a substory romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oftdone plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances itbr br checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in caps this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor rolesbr br i love films with a harder edge rounders the escapist schwarzeneggerstallone fare goodfellows even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by youve got mail and sleepless in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldnt have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the costars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these megafilms as well
