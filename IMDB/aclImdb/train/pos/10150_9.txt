sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich√©s but its entertaining and thats what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty cant be disguised as for michael vartan im sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i dont understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to seebr br olivia dabo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if dabos british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadnt really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception br br its a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube thats why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey im a sentimental guy who tears up easily dont get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of thosebr br i give it 910 only because im saving my 1010 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think youll like it
