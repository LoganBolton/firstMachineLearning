this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5why notit is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christjohnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter mostlike our churchesthe film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through itgreat credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fansat least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christiansthanks fox for producing itas walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiecemovies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith
