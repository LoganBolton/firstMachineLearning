there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that br br 1jesus was blond br br 2the last supper was a huge mealbr br 3 he liked playing with the childrenbr br 4his death was for all people and for all timebr br the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons
