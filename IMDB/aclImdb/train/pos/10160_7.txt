i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy brated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her wastobe husband its sounds farfetched but it actually works quite well br br 710  overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out
