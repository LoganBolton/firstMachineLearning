i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in romcom above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting whoda thunk itbr br parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser filmsbr br a movie like this never gets its dues from closeminded males its too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting br br and its depiction of contemporary la and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made la look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a moviebr br i wont divulge the plot but as a longtime and hardcore atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and lighthearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyablebr br this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy howeverbr br if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc youll enjoy this br br a firstrate job all around even if its kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesnt detract from the movies overall excellence
