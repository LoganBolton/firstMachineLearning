ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so im writing this from a girls perspective i think its a shame it only scored 52 in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because im female i dont enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good oneliners fine acting although eva longoria parkers character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs
