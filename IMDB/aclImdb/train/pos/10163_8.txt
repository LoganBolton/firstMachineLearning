this had a good storyit had a nice pace and all characters are developed coolbr br ive watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one ive seen in the two weeksbr br jason biggs character was the best thoughbr br even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginningbr br this may be a romantic comedy and i dont like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty coolbr br this film scored pretty high out of all the movies ive seen lately  and the rest were big budget or better publicizedbr br good job in writing
