this is a great filmbr br i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it excpet mike from friendsbr br but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and wittybr br paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking apocalypse now here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work wellbr br in all a great feelgood film that really deserves a lot more credit than it getsbr br everyone has their own tastes but i really dont understand the one star reviews for this
