i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mildbr br the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc√© falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they dont get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasnt as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gaybutnotgay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasnt really very funnybr br in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call
