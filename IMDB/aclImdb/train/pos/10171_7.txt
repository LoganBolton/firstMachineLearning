once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a sovietera poster saying ne boltay meaning dont gossip i translated it for the generation of tv watchers as dont be gladys kravitz in reference to the nosy neighbor on bewitchedbr br however when you see the result of gossip in the pvt snafu short rumors you see that its not quite a laughing matter in this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states so he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to snafuwell you know what i mean yes its mostly wwii propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the japanese  but i have to say that the pvt snafu shorts were actually quite funny of course since they had dr seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices its no surprise that these came out rather cool worth seeing
