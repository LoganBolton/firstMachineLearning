de grot is a terrific dutch thriller based on the book written by tim krabbé another of his books het gouden ei was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called spoorloos the vanishing in 1988 this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called the vanishing but there are times it comes closebr br especially the opening moments are terrific we see a man later we learn his name is egon wagter fedja van huêt coming from a plane in thailand when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border these scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like thisbr br from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flashforward we see how egon still as a child here played by erik van der horst befriends a guy named axel as a kid played by benja bruijning we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how axel as an adult played by marcel hensema became a criminal egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with himbr br the movie is chronological in a way it shows egon and axel as kids than as students young adults and in their midthirties but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adultsbr br minor spoilers hereinbr br the title means the cave and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy like the beginning the ending is terrific the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well
