de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé who also adapted this story for the screen some really topclass acting not only by van huêt but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tvwork prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flashback structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the characterdriven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a mustsee especially if you liked spoorloos the vanishings original screen adaptation
