i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some scifi show while waiting for the bsg new seasonbr br but after few episodes i became a fan ive loved the characters  the notsostupidasyouthinkheis jack oneill the notonlysmart samantha carter the glorious tealc women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel jacksonbr br of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly its not about technology or space fighting  its about helping your friend even risking your life for him its about we dont leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human  humanbr br and now its breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good
