i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought hey another film starring aishu and shah rukh little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes shakti is a film about a mothers love and endurance its a film about transformations ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie its actually a dream sequence that occurs while srks drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him the title of the song is ishq kamina loosely translated as loves a bitch and it is just plain smoking hot dont miss it
