this is probably karisma at her best apart from zubeidaa nana patekar also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it couldve been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including karimas mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch herbr br the sets were also pretty good i didnt really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india its as real as it getsbr br overall i would give it a thumbs up
