uneven bollywood drama karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend sanjay kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller film is compelling its few songdance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this films drama at least once weve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happygolucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with his throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjays sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious adlibs the directorial style of writerdirector krishna wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto shaktis soundtrack cd but bollywood hasnt yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but shakti is karisma kapoors film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes despite the unevenness of much of the picture karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty id noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette both of which id seen just prior although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal chinas tang dynasty  whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext
