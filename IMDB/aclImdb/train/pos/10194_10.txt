this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as mitchell in malta at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfitnot to mention acting like an old west gunslinger mitchell being mitchell the film wouldnt have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either oh well at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst i cant imagine watching it on its own however
