on sunday july 27 1997 the first episode of a new science fiction series called stargate sg1 was broadcast on showtime a spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film stargate starring kurt russell and james spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg1 originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack oneill two ls michael shanks as dr daniel jackson amanda tapping as captain samantha carter christopher judge as tealc and don s davis as major general george s hammond for ten long years we watched the team battle against the goauld the replicators the ori and many other aggressors at the same time they forged alliances with the asgard the tokra the rebel jaffa the nox and the tollan they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even thenbr br as with all longrunning series they were numerous cast changes michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor daniel jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was jonas quinn an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara played by corin nemec however shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go the shows original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg1 in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter jack oneill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reasonbr br the ninth season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goauld and the replicators in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goauld as the series main adversaries three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg1 his farscape costar the lovely claudia black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran a former goauld host and con artist from another planet a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack oneill and general hammond for the last two years they starred alongside the sg1 faithful michael shanks amanda tapping and christopher judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchisebr br alas all good things must come to an end during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in cancellation in its august 2006 after ten seasons and 214 episodes the dream was finally over on march 13 2007 what began with children of the gods ended with unending the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the scifi channel in the united states on june 22 2007br br in the ten years that the series was on the air it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek in terms of popularity in certain countries it became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world second only to doctor who 19631989 and the longestrunning american produced scifi series having surpassed the xfiles only a few months before it endedbr br stargate sg1 represents the cornerstone of the stargate franchise in 2004 its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008 although plans for another feature film fell through two directtodvd films stargate the ark of truth and stargate continuum were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future a third liveaction series stargate universe is also due to premiere at some point next year there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better despite the end of sg1 and atlantis as continuing series the future of stargate looks very bright indeedbr br in conclusion while stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as star trek and doctor who its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many many years to come
