imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources ive seen including the excellent program notes mark it as 68 doesnt really matter except that its quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year pure abstraction isnt really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
