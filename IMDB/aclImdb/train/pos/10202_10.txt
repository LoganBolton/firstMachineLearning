i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the ratings some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you dont like comic books or animation then of course you wont like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and heroicsexy women kicking butt and saving the worldhell you will love this movie i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie quite animeesque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation like titan ae meets the live action version of punisher in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie
