in my years of attending film festivals i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the 3 bins at walmart i just found dvd of yank tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rockbottom remainderbr br i loved this film wish id seen it at the cinema in its everything id have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly its good for americans to stretch a little if the films title helps the us audience to explore random chaos all the better cinema imitates life  visa versabr br also i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars come on the euro is not hard to figure out make the gringo audiences do the math seeing a film especially one shot in paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me br br looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer  director as well
