this isnt exactly a great film but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different the films main theme is fate and small seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors though instead of focusing on one random event seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion plus an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scenelike hes some sort of omnipotent being but theres absolutely no explanation of him in the film like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxybr br the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou this is capitalize on her success in amelie though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role the pace is brisk the acting fine and the conclusion isnt bad at all the only reason i didnt score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots
