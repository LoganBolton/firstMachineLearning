we have to remember that the 50s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i dont who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapybr br this one is a pip its about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead fathers estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay hes initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity  if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad its hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called belair productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scenebr br i cant explain it  not even to myself  but i gave this pile of trash an 810 im familiar with the term its so bad its good but i dont think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebodys basement
