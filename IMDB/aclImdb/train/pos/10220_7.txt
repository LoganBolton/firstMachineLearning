that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say its funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally  too only two of the sisters are really bad boy are they bad too one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where eer she goes the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe she has those sensual slightly parted lips and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the otherbr br all three sisters are played by starlets the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield he had something of a careerbr br this looks today like possibly the first mainstream softcore porn ever marketed well of course not the first but the raciest at that timebr br the girls wear as little as possible and lets not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor  whose fetish was this  barechested he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuitbr br theres a real plot here too the girls family see is cursed they are prone to suicide  or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicidebr br the movie is not bad i truly dont know where it was shown maybe it was made for driveins somehow and i could be wrong i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here the women are scantily dressed they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novelsbr br but the guy seems to be the central focus not everyone in the movie likes him but all the girls love him and i think the audience is meant to alsobr br its lots of fun  and on its own terms too
