some spoilersbr br i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms acting dated dialogue unclear storyline unfounded belafonte is great as a brandoesque menacing swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically illequipped from his past life to do so he learns too late how empty his hustling materialistic life was without love mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny in spite of his prayers for a miracle his bitterness prevents him from accepting or believing in one the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other the result being hilarious and touchingly sadbr br the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film after looking everywhere for belafonte mostel looks up to see a falling feather and he frantically reaches for it as if hes finally willing to believe in angels and miracles but belafonte wasnt allowed to finish his miracle either to restore fannys health or mostels faith so he never got his wings the feather floats tauntingly out of mostels grasp a metaphor for both mens live its too late and you dont get a second chance like its a wonderful life this movie is magical wonderful funny but terribly tragic
