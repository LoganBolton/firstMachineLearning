most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm not so this gloriously bent batty and berserk overthetop italianmade shotincanada kitsch gutbuster its a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously overbaked what the hells going on crackpot excess and inanitybr br a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70s disco stud complete with jumbo wavy afro perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice they dethaw the beast jolt him back to life with electric charges grossly mistreat him and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth before you can say hey the filmmakers are obviously ripping off king kong our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen the gorgeous pheonix grant he lays lustful eyes on and storms away with his new lady love the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience of course he breaks free again nabs the vixen and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampagebr br the sublimely stupid dialogue sample line philosophy has no place in science professor cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jawdropping awfulness clunky misdirection and a heavyhanded script that even attempts a clumsily sincere is the yeti a man or a beast ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen better still we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yetis nipples which causes it to harden and elicits a big leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth  the vixen nurses the yetis wounded hand while he makes googoo eyes at her the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building and the furry fellow even breaks a mans neck with his toes  overall this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded shouldbe camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy thats eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following
