being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decentbr br decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giantmonster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy scifi film by farbr br yeti looks like a longhaired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert and really hes not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cagelike thing godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening he doesnt even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys arebr br however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and hes pretty much in the whole movie and in typical lowbudget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and theres even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing therebr br yes the special effects arent the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it  shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside  in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad moviebr br yeti never stoops as low as say ape does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yetis nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isnt that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewerbr br the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesnt get boring  the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happybr br yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong 76 ripoffs like ape and queen kong by very far
