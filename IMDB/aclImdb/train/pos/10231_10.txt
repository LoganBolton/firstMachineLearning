heres another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a ripoff of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jacksons miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzis city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyesbr br the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex  the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a tradeoff you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster whos size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots aplenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey moviebr br its here that the film won me over its enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and gods gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and actionadventure genre film scene from the 1960s1970s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldnt have worked  which is exactly why peter jacksons movie sucked br br he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all its faults  clunkiness kramers yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space id rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloidbr br 1010 its about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and id rather go out with a smile on my face
