having seen most of ringo lams films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual its a ancient china period piece cranked full of kickass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is nexttoimpossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest chinatown in north america like i do if you can find it dont pass it up
