people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but im glad to say this movie isnt one of them over nine million dollars which i dont think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didnt think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years
