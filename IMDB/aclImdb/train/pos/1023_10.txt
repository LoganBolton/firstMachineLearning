this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years i will sadly miss it although atlantis has filled the hole a small bitbr br the last ever episode of sg1on television anywaywas beautifully done robert wrote something that felt close to reality as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to ups and downs but over the years theyve turned into a family i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone elses criticismsbr br sg1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement the wonderful characters stories directors writers from episode one i was hooked the blend of action science drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting morebr br there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossiblebr br i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them i never want the show to diebr br stargate sg1  1997  2007
