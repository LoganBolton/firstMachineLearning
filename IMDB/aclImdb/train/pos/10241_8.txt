i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 54 rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesnt wow me as much at 17 but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and wont mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyess deathwhich still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most indepth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin shorts clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he couldve been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscarworthy has its funny and heartwarming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i dont get the rating honestly i dont sure this film isnt perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun 7510 bethany cox
