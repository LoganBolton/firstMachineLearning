i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time what stood out for me was the lack of midmovie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just dont say the one thing that youre shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this is what i like the most about the movie i guess that the main characters dont do mean things to each other halfway through they dont break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes onbr br these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track theyre not that different loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone anyway i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again sure theres plot holes if you analyze the script and no woog and dweeb shouldnt be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in realitybr br now what detracts from the film is its unexpected scariness little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr screweyes and the addition of him halfway through the movie though its blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that its not that scary without the the dinosaurs i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second halfbr br considering the target audience who im sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues i think ill give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story its a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think
