this movie has to be my favorite of all time its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people charlie sheen i thinkto believe it was a real snuff film this was an exercise in visual effects and doesnt cut away when the action happens like every other film does movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood there still are movie makers who still cant get fake blood to look like the real thing there is no rape scene because that wasnt the point of making the film have you seen the hills have eyes 2 the rape scene was funny instead of shocking although im sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror but since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldnt be able to pull it off the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucksbr br its too bad that a movie cant be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an ao or nc17 rating im sure eli roth has the abilitytalent to make his hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an r ratingor at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitationsbr br watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident  crime scenesfootage dont forget that this movie was made in 1985 the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics
