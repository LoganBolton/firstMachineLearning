i havent always been a fan but the show grew on me it wasnt until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show they finally brought daniel jacksons search for his wife to an end and finally most of the goould system lords were killed by rival lords sg1 or othersbr br towards season 5 stargate sg1 was beginning to become stale with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise the show became more and more solidbr br the characters had become stale as well colonel jack oneill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with oneills weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the goould ra the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself only allowing his close friends inbr br amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter she was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job though this character had little area to grow tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carters strengths she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently br br christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien tealc tealc was an alien called the jaffa infant goould snake like creatures would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form the jaffa would die tealc was the first prime of apophis army knowing that apophis was not a god like goould pretend he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy finally having had enough he and jack oneill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people after arriving on earth he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the goould christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character tealc is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher master bratac the show would not be complete without master bratac played by tony amandola he is also a rock in the end he became adviser to most of sg1 especially daniel jackson br br don s davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal he does his job has a wife sons and daughters and grandchildren you can really say he is the anchor of the base simply i would die for that man if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world he will go himself he doesnt leave anyone behindbr br i saved dr daniel jackson for last because this character i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on in choosing shanks i dont think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson they dont talk about spader they talk about shanks in the early years the jackson character came off as a whiner thats why i probably wasnt a fan as the seasons pasted the character became stronger this gave him confidence in the end as of season 10 the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero he still monitors the groups ethics he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward acheaology history culture and exploration are part of his very being he is determined though a man of peace he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement br br other characters include most recently vala mal doranclaudia black and colonel cameron mitchellben browder new lead of sg1 both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess i see little difference between mitchell and crichton farscape character blacks character is simply off the wall definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon
