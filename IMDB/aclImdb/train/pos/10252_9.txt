after having watched guinea pig two questions come in mind  besides am i really a psychopath to watch that    is it a snuff  the answer is no  although its the closest thing to a snuff movie ive ever seen and then  where the hell have they found that girl  because she gets tortured for 45 min without any reasons given  in fact there is nothing else in this movie   fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots  and many more until the final scene  im still not sure how they did that  because it belongs to the japonese underground scene its obvious she didnt get a lot of money so what were her  their  motivations br br i saw it in japonese without subtitles but its not a problem  no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes  i havent seen yet all the serial but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one still ive rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good  ask charlie sheen the actor  but i think they could have gone further which they did in the following onesbr br another movie im hiding from my parentsbr br 810
