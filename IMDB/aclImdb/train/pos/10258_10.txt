wow alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run unearthed films we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people bash it im writing this review because i love the guinea pig films why do i love em its because they go for the throat and they dont let go ive seen it all almost every horror film known to man argento fulci bava buttgereit from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster ive seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films why because it doesnt try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place this review is for the devils experiment i find it devoid of story which is fine by me why do i watch horror films so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people the devils experiment not only delivers but thats all it is pure unadulterated violence yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold why do people bash it cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story it make em feel better about themselves we all want blood and gore its just really hard to justify it if its not wrapped around a story the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been releasedbr br im thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world maybe i shouldnt have written this review but then again maybe i should my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again its not ive always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films sure its exploitive and over the top but isnt that why we watch horror films in the 1st place the devils experiment is not for everybody its for thrill seekers and gorehounds only if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you there is a reason why they havent been released for over 17 years they are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool good luck enjoy and never stop living your life
