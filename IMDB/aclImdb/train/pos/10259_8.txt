a lot of people unfairly sht on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining devils experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudgetbr br let me start at the beginning now for those who dont know this film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid80s its plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is this entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky woundbr br the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedingsbr br the actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukesbr br if you havent seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot 8510 for devils experiment
