my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season 5 the show took a different focus  still good but differentbr br the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egyptbr br the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great scifi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictablebr br the characters on which the show rests are also welldefined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watchbr br starting somewhere around season 5 the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the goauld then the ori the plots become more complex a lot more politicalstrategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in naturebr br one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes they are simply cantmiss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasonsbr br if you are a scifi fan watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and youll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to
