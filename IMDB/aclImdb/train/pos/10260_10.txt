the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of blackclad men who torture her for several days before finally killing hershe is beaten savagelyspun around in the chair endlesslyhas her finger nails pulledanimal guts are thrown at herhot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needlereally sick and nasty scenethe makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tapeof course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesomei have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadisticbut less disturbinganywaythis one is a mustsee for horror fans
