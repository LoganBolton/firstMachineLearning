this movie should not be compared to the sting or other caperheistcon game films what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships deceit and trust its also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy highly hugely recommended
