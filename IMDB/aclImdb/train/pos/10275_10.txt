get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time i am relatively unaware of david mamets writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen timesits always a joy to watch i can say without hesitation that he is a genius this film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit conartistry and back room hustles the feel of the film is very similar to the sting 1973 and it also pays homage to film noirbr br its quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watchbr br generally the acting is superb especially joe mantegna but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that its not a good idea to have a heroine lindsay crouse who is not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80s hairdo i agree but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the rolebr br the less you know about the plot of this film the better just like mamets most recent film the spanish prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance
