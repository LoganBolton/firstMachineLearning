house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that were dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate so it stands to reason that we never really know whats going on even though we think that we do but thats what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessitiesbr br it has a definite hitchcock slant to it the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort marnie considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the masters more thoughtprovoking works one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouses character being the same as tippi hedrinsten year later perhaps both are strongwilled loners both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool as crouses repressed uptight character says whats life without adventure put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks
