im not great at writing reviews so ill just spout my opinionsbr br i loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama i thought it was all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis i loved them all davis it seemed was the fifthmost important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and andersons character colonel oneill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff i dont know whether its because hammond was more important that i realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to br br the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasnt the original intention a brilliant setup to the series i recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again youll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv seriesbr br the last three seasons of the series arent nearly as good as the first seven but that doesnt mean they arent good it just means theyre a letdown if youve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasonsbr br after you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is a worthy successor to this brilliant seriesbr br edit on 71808 i just found out that don s davis died a few weeks ago it is a great loss
