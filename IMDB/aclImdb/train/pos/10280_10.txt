house of games is spell binding its so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens there are few movies ive seen that can grip you so quickly from the opening scene this movie just gets youbr br im trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so dont read anymore if you dont want to knowbr br i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seenbar none from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayedbr br lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately joe mantegna was also wonderful the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices i also loved the way the movie was filmed in that grainy surreal type of way it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it wasbr br there were a few movies ive seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really house of games is completely different in its way margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters ive seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying you know somethings going to happen but you have no idea what and just when you think youve guessed what the something is you realize you havent even scratched the surfacebr br house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to its conclusionbr br in closing id rank this 10 of 10 call it although not my absolute favorite film pretty high on the list most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists ive ever seen as well although i love all types and genres of movies when it comes to movies of the human psyche it really doesnt get much better then this see this movie
