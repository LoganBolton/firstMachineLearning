heres my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well br br the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the allencompassing con its like the grifters but without that films level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouses lines  the way she reads them  sound as if theyre inner monologue or narration which they arent with the arrival of mantegna things pick upbr br the dialogue here isnt as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ringadingding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones dont it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words hes far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality whats more strange is that other than this the film doesnt look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowedbr br i wouldnt mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines  or even play characters speaking play lines  but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines its a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesnt work that doesnt mean the movie is bad  it isnt its often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middlebr br its standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is shes a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room ill admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting shed write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end howeverbr br and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones  the little learner ones  to be the most fun were getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is br br we see the ending coming and then we didnt see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didnt see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true callingbr br im going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the halfhour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again  james foley did him betterbr br
