i have to say from the beginning when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasnt blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of potential though the movie wasnt as erm amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though im not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i dont remember one line from either of those movies im not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you dont have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end in 2006br br though i didnt like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasnt for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 and im glad he did other wise i wouldnt have seen the brilliant shows like sg1 which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isnt better or as good as sg1 its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you dont watch this then you have no idea what you are missing
