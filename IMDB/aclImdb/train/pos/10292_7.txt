let me start out by saying im a big carrey fan although ill admit i havent seen all of his movies coughthe magesticcough bruce almighty was enjoyable none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end i dont know what the writers were thinking somehow i couldnt help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at recreating liar liarbr br on a positive note the daily shows steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast see bruce almighty if youre a big jim carrey fan or if you just want to see a lighthearted que soft piano music somewhat funny comedy
