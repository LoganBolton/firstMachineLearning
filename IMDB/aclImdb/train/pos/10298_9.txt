i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasnt the goal his character is like all of us wanting more  better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliverbr br morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itselfbr br i thought jennifer anistons character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carrys basically selfcentered tv anchorman wannabe but thats the way it was writtenbr br i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happenedbr br i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heartbr br a funny film
