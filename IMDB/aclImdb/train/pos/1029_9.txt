i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 br br the final episode of the 10th season unending where it would certainly appear that the asgard have been killedoff in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief br br from the extremely rushed end of the series its obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg1 franchise for the two upcoming directtodvd movesbr br unless the asgard return in a future sg1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor cleanup of looseendsbr br poor end to an otherwise brilliant scifi series
