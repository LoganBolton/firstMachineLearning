i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i dont remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over itbr br about 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasnt was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organiclooking film not that thats a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including handtinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the films scenes filmed off of a video monitor giving it a more distressed lores lookbr br dont get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972 thats why its still one of my favorite shortexperimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well
