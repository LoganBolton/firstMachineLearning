bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan an average man who feels god is messing up his life god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways of course giving someone gods powers could take a turn for the worse bruce almighty is a good comedy jim carrey is good as always morgan freeman is firstrate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well the jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carreys facial expressions i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as a black man i thought this quite well especially with the brilliant freeman there are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film 67 out of 10
