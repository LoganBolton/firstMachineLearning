as someone who lives near buffalo new york this movie scored points with me before i even saw it since the story is based here there are even some bit parts with reallife newstv anchor people from buffaloand for once it doesnt knock the area hallelujahbr br theologywise puhleeze god is still made to look and think like humansand of course be a bit on the liberal side being the lightweight comedy it is its nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes br br there are some laughoutloud slapstick comedy scenes and hopefully audiences  from christians to atheists got something out of this besides a few laughs such as what prayer should really be all about kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good messagebr br overall its a goodhearted film that should offend very few
