i really do not know what people have against this film but its definitely one of my favourites its not preachy its not anchored by its moral it shouldnt be controversial its just god any possible god no matter the religion and its really funnybr br jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final straws are executed hes quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until hes guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous groundbr br ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the stepbystep fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly wellbr br as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place carreys pitchperfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a its a wonderful life wannabebr br jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you dont think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget youre watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couplebr br the movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carreys career which wasnt goin anywhere
