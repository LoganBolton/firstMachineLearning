i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television scifi series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters if you look at the original star trek and star trektng they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes in many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring this was less the case with deep space 9 with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other trek shows as there was more of a larger story that unified them this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg1 the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funnybr br and speaking of funny i loved that sg1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasnt so dreadfully serious in this way i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5 jack oneill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpsonits really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasonsbr br to truly appreciate sg1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power and if you dont like sg1 after giving it a fair chance then scifi is probably not the genre for you
