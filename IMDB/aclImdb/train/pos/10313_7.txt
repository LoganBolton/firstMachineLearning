china obrien 1990 was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or hes lost his touch because hes not that great of a director the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms rothrock and richard norton if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straighttovideo action flickbr br china obrien returns home to help out her dad hes having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help so she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil croniesbr br if youre a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movies catered for you i only enjoyed the fighting scenes everything else is rubbish why didnt raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action directorbr br recommended
