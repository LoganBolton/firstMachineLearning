this one and her pilgrim soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series theres something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned its a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serlings version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite i remember i wasnt surprised by the korean movie il mare later remade into the lake house i think its because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film
