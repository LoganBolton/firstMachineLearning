this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge tvlooking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain ageand the examination day a point where 12yearolds must undergo a governmentrequired iq test the kid is this story dickie jordan david mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades his parents christopher allport and elizabeth norment on the other hand say he shouldnt have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe hes capable and he should have no need to worry its pretty obvious they are worried i wont give anything away in the ending but i will say this  theres a point where we get a glimpse of whats to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask dickie whether hed prefer to watch tv all night by todays standards wed be pleased hed say hed rather read and not just because theres nothing worth watchingbut why would his family ask this the flavor of whats encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon which i hear hasnt received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they couldve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i havent read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting  a 16yearld boy peter robert duncan mcneill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his massachusetts hometownbut he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne kerry noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since its common for that to happen in 1985 but the connection doesnt go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each others company especially peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college hes been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700 the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lessonwarning that sounds like something rod sterling wouldve cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably 34 of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterlings crew
