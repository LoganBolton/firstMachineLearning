it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseballbr br likewise an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyones house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to worlds events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh realitybr br the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviouslythe newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visualnarrative method of story tellingbr br the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borroughs tarzan and johnston mcculleys zorro the 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g8s battle aces and the spidermaster of men all found their way to the news stands among many othersbr br one other was doc savage a fullblooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super herobr br he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologistarchaeologistpaleontologist etcbr br the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s and were published into the middle 50s then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirtbr br the reintroduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together it was veteran stopaction animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothersbr br when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tvron elys nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this casebr br the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the storybr br from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pals being the producerhis last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the pulp characters worldbr br i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our 2nd child michelle081475 our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre 63rd  kedzie here in chicagobr br having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this camp business but would not have objected if mrpal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulpcomicserial type excitementbr br and yet the cast headedup by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyonebr br and maybe thats just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of bronze
