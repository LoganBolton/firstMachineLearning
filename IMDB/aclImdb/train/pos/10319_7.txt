having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass lets be honest here  this film is just so much funbr br okso i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the characters but lets put this into a clear perspectivedo the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original seriesbr br the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but thats precisely its charmbr br former tarzan ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berrymanbr br best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen  pricelessbr br simply put the film doesnt take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and youll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed
