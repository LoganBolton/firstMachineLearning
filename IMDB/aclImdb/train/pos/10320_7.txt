possible spoilersbr br i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron ely is just right as doc cool calm almost always in controland with an occasional twinkle in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i dont know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derringdo many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark which i dont think is fair the difference in budget is astoundingraiders must have at least 10 times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the sousa music is catchylove that theme song every time i watch the film i end up humming the theme for daysthe best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it 7 out of 10br br doc savage doc savagethank the lord hes here
