i saw a trailer for this on afro promo the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring africanamericans it looked like what it is a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay it would seem that redd foxxs rf wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in phoenix he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angelesbr br so as rf arrives norman wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts gets out of his waterbed to answer the door trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor norman tries to wake his lover who steadfastly refuses to budge it was just to the point where i wrote why wont he wake up when suddenly he does and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed swirlhairdoed garson normans white livein lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 la he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunchbr br norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit garson goes to stay with waylon flowers and madam answers the phone when norman calls br br so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico while he is on the phone garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like were about to hear a very special track by the emotions he realizes that his son is gaybr br his first impulse is ill kill him ill kill him then rf goes on a long walk wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality this it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all br br rf then hires audrey a sixfoot amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melodybr br then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night he commiserates over the loss of rfs wife and tells the tale of his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because she was molested at a luau they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose once more mouths were agapebr br so it seems that wouldnt ya just know it rf and garson have a wonderful evening together you see staid traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer its really just that simple this still does not prevent rf from yelling rape when garson wakes him from a bad dream it ends less predictably than youd thinkbr br there was so much that was just off what is the basis of norman and garson s relationship they dont seem to have any rapport and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never defends garson or talks about their relationship there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexualityand sitting right down on the park bench to read them i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friendsbr br other than that its kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance we could all learn to love and understand one another and because of the whole naiveté of this thing the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by extension convert thembr br  hey check out cinema de merde my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in you can find the url in my email address above
