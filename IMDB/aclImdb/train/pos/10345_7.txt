the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i dont know much about its unfortunate when there arent many comments for a certain tile because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast you dont get an idea of what to expect i read the review before watching this title and i dont know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the greatest i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable it isnt one of the great alltime classics but a pleasant and funny diversionmuch more than you can hope for in most newer movies if you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed
