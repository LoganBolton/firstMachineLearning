i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family hes a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and longsuffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop runningbr br the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decentmaking them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didnt ring true it sounded more like antifascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoyingparticularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accentbr br its really tough to believe that the ultrafamous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesnt sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is goodbut the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent momentsbut thats really about all
