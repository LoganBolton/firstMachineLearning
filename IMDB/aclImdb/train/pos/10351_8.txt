when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock australia lindy chamberlain meryl streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus lindy doesnt help matters either because she wont play to the jury or courtroom shes only herself and shes a tough nut to crack so of course everyone thinks shes guilty because theres a piece of evidence that hasnt come to light sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain a seventhday adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife its good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too because the australian public doesnt believe the story and the media only fans the flames eventually lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor but years later a missing piece of evidence shows up and shes freed but not until after the familys life is basically ruined a heartbreaking story very well done a bit long but well worth seeing 8 out of 10
