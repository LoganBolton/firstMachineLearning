i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters lindy and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their lifes tragic disarray the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip news media crowds mobs and assumptions its not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular its merely an account of a true story that happened there society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we arebr br when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigines dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of ones own unaware perceptions influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround ones life the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the massesbr br the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside suspicion was jetfueled mostly by a virtue of hers to the public eye she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up for tv and the press how much of the downward spiral couldve been prevented had she behaved more to the publics liking in the media meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of filmmaking but she and the screenwriters do understand lindy what is infuriating is that its not that difficult apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situationbr br whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophies choice the devil wears prada angels in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself she frustrates us because we dont know what shes thinking or feeling it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her but this is the movies way of suggesting the reaction of the publics attentionbr br she is married to a pastor and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most initially they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to gods will kickstarting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughters death was some sort of ritual killing on their part whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the medias intake didnt immediately identify so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungrywellbr br meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen but the australian public plays the real leads here like punctuation for each plot advance director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projectionsbr br this golanglobus docudrama is not particularly memorable the settings atmosphere doesnt give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public
