i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself the cast just makes it that much more appealing meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture she nails mrs chamberlains mannerisms the accent and even look she shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that lindy had to endure and in the process its hard to remember that it isnt lindy in my opinion this performance of meryls was better than her oscarwinning turn in sophies choice and should have garnered her her third oscar sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasnt recognized by the academy with at least a nomination in all this movie only receive one oscar nod streeps for best actress however it did receive several australian oscars and nominationsbr br definitely a toprate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast
