this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at its impact on australian society it especially looks at the problem of innuendo gossip and expectation when dealing with reallife dramasbr br one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings its an issue that has to be constantly addressedbr br the leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing basedonfact individuals some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors it reenforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individualsbr br spoiler warningbr br i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an exadventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers it captured the themes of the story brilliantlybr br i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could while this is especially apt for this story i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well
