spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlains guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone  plates dr james camerons certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasnt apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didnt believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azarias clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and ive been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyones guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and dont think it could have been done better ive always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think its not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didnt receive more publicity at the time it was released
