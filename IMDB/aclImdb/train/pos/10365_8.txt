this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears meryl streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isnt particularly likablebr br the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the 50s these reallife situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating why isnt sam sheppard in jail the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and sheppard was tried and convicted only after years in jail was he exoneratedbr br i love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process this is one of those movies other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include hurricane the thin blue line and breaker morant in particular the latter is another australian film which is highly recommendedbr br 810
