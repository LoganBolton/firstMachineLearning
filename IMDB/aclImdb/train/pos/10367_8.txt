when i first saw a cry in the dark i had no idea what the plot was but when i saw it i was shocked at what it portrayed when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class i realized a second point communication issues you see when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlains meryl streep baby she and her husband michael sam neill were griefstricken but didnt show it as seventh day adventists they believed that god willed this to happen and so they couldnt mourn it but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness everyone started believing that lindy did it herselfbr br the point is the wrong message got communicated to the public and it turned people against lindy even though this was a pure accident it still happened it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media regardless of any media outlets political viewsbr br as for the performances streep does a very good job with an australian accent no surprise there and sam neill is equally great you will probably get blown away just by what you see here definitely one of fred schepisis best movies ever
