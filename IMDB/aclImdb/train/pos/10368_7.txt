meryl streep was incredible in this film she has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted she was played realistically too she got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt i didnt expect much from the film initially but i really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events it turned out to be better than i had anticipated sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work ive seen from him and ive really liked him in other movies the piano for example i gave the film a 7 but if i could rate just the acting id give the it a 95 and a perfect 10 for streep
