some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them as i watched this film made in 1988 in 1999 i thought i was watching the oj simpson debacle although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situationbr br the australian news media if this movie is to be believed devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought it was scary to see the scenes of invasive swarming media hordes ridiculous accounts of halftruths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of societybr br equally appalling is the medias depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case the accused are sevenday adventistsbr br today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more importantbr br streep is excellent as usual and this is the best ive ever seen sam neill the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible
