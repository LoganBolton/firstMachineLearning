the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was rebroadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the 20th century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a womenonly section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my alltime great movie moments i dont think of this as a gay movie its an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd
