almost 30 years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender periodically i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd its september of 2004 and i keep hoping  deep sighbr br one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a primetime evening soap the other frances lee mccain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as i recall it on a shortlived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and upandcoming playwrightsbr br i watched it every time it was shown on pbs maybe 2 or 3 times that was before the era of vcrs so i have no record of it except in my minds eyebr br 12312006 addition to above happy new year ladies this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipperorg my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writers own personal copy
