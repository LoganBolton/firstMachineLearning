having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasnt that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy dukes legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment its amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first seriesbr br back to the movie if you watch this film in its own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then its not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and thats really what doh is all about johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumbanddumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and mc gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p coltrane the way he always should have beenbr br if you dont like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldnt be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining caraction movie with a few good laughs thats not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind
