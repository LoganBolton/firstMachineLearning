im a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbustersbr br its funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and its much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slotbr br and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screenbr br while sean william scott and johnny knoxville arent exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasnt too keen on burts boss hogg though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scarybr br and who didnt have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzardbr br folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you wont be sorry its just a great dumb movie
