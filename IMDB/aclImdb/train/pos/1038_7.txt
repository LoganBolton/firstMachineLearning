loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it but for me ms davis very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms davis they would be laughed off the screenbr br i really think she phoned this one in now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much morebr br i guess i just dont get bette davis ive always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role shes in the possible exception is now voyagerbr br im sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this but ill continue to watch the movies shes in because i like the storieswritingsupporting casts but ill always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job
