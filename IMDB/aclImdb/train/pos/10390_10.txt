next to star wars and the wizard of oz this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made its a true shame its not as wellknown as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or scifi settings and that its british meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that its deserved that reputationbr br like all great family films one can be a child an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this film im currently 18 but one must appreciate classic films first i absolutely adore this film it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any john williams star wars score a fast but not flashy pace beautiful sets dialog and use of color both the sets and cinematography won oscars and stateoftheart oscarwinning special effects for the time and some are still stunning and of course june duprezs sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zetajones she even looks like jones in a waybr br in conclusion this is one of my alltime favorite movie next to the adventures of robin hood and it truly deserves more attention it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout and along with robin hood its my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyedbr br stars  excellent
