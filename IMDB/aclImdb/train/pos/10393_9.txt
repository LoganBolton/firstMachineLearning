lets cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true arabiannights style theres an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only quibble the special effects are pretty dated loved sabu with the djinns foot though
