this was usually producer alexander kordas advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out pushing it to sixbr br for john kobals 1987 book the top 100 movies his survey of 81 film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach 55th place a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture but their high placings were enough to take it to near the halfway markbr br the outbreak of the second world war saw the movies production shifted around england and america eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical oscars like citizen kane it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than lovebr br the special effects outstanding for the time are still reasonable and actually hold up if you squint but its not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions among them is an amusing horse constructed out of a kit model which when a key is inserted up its rear end begins to fly theres also a killer toy of the sixarmed goddess kali perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrificlooking giant spider also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as in a superb moment of cinematic conceit a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings and look out for the moment where hes tricked back into his bottlebr br john justin does well as the arabic king who for some strange reason has an english accent and a stiff upper lip sabu the astonishingly muscled 15Â–yearold is nearnamesake abu a likeably cocky thief after they cross paths with the evil jaffer conrad veidt justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmeds justins perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues in truth the second half is someway the better being full of greater incident and more fantastical in naturebr br three small songs pepper the piece though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldnt classify this as a musical its all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads veidt is the boohiss villain and abu is the youthful irrepressible robber it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies but once youve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in quite commendable
