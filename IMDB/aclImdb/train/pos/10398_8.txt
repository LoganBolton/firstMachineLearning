although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is specialbr br if youve never seen this film before youll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disneys aladdin cribbed from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makersbr br ive given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting it doesnt kill the film but it does weaken itbr br still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie
