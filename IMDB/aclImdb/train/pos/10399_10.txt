this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time now that im grown up and have a kid of my own i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie we watched it last friday and he liked it during abus fight with the giant spider my sons hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared is he gonna beat the spider poppa just watch youll see he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so bagdad under the grandson of haroun alraschid might as well be oz under ozmabr br i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derringdo were perpetrated by the boythief and not the grownup king in fact if you deconstruct the films narrative a bit the king is the thiefs sidekick not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys br br its definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time hes eleven or twelve my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely onedimensional  as a cynical friend commented why does ahmad love the princess because the narrative demands it the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless lovestruck deposed king is equally improbable but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fiftyfoot genies and the temple of the allseeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movies climax is tremendous as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last
