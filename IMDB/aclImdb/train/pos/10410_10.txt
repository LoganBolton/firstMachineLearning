the thief of baghdad is one of my ten alltime favorite movies it is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless the casting couldnt have been better rex ingram made me believe in genies and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar he set the bar very highbr br i watch this movie at least twice a yearand never tire of it this film is an adventure for all agesnoone too old to enjoy it the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent timei was ten years old the first time i saw it and the us was just about to enter wwii conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in casablanca and korda teamed upi believe with justin and dupree again in the four feathersgreat filmmaking
