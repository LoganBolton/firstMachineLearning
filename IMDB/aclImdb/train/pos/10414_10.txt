i first discovered alexander kordas 1940 fantasy the thief of bagdad in the early 1950s on a reissue billed as the wonder show of the century both korda technicolor films the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made as the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the films color in the way it had originally been presented in true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950s both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it  nice but not as it should be now comes the mgm dvd 3 dec 2002 issue the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once i watched it a second time the only extras are a spanish dubbed version subtitles in both english  spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer thank you mgm for this exceptional dvd release now one can only hope that kordas four feathers and a restored version of kordas jungle book to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on dvd
