mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth dorothy kirsten eduard franz and ludwig donath this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even todaybr br the film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten judmila novotna blanche thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film if youre a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from lucia will strike you as odd  even if carusos wife dorothy just had a baby girl also its highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia the role lay too high for himbr br in taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of carusos life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the laundry he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talkingmachine company later rca victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquakebr br instead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a hemorrhage during lelisir damore at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met his last role as eleazar in la juive what killed him the same thing that killed valentino  peritonitis his first role at the met was not radames in aida as indicated in the film but the duke in rigoletto so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy carusos biography of her husband thats what it was  suggested what is true is that dorothys father disowned her after her marriage and left her 1 of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007 however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothybr br some people say that lanzas voice is remarkably like carusos but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point  carusos voice is remarkably unlike lanzas in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a baritone he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic tenor role which lanza definitely was not lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herselfbr br really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same
