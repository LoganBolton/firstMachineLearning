an american woman her european husband and children return to her mothers home in watch on the rhine a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman and starring paul lukas whom i believe is repeating his stage role here bette davis lucile watson george coulouris geraldine fitzgerald and donald woods an antifascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the nazis kurt muller lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy motherinlaw but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him outbr br great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth lillian hellmans liberal point of view it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes the movies big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in casablanca humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick but lukas is transcendent as kurt the monologue he has about the need to kill is gutwrenching just to mention one scenebr br though this isnt what one thinks of as a bette davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as kurts loyal and loving wife sara her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tenderbr br the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions lillian hellman is not everyones cup of tea but unlike the little foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers highly recommended
