i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise 1995 and before sunset 2004 and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain whybr br before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead poets society only 25 at the time of the films release and julie delpy the three colors trilogy then 26 although looking much younger he is a promiscuous american writer touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the budapestvienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on lovebr br the film has 1990s written all over it back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all its hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies celines accent if by mistake or on purpose was half americanhalf french and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the characters credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clich√©d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesnt let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth whilebr br all in all sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future
