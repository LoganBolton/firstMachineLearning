this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that ive ever seen closely followed by none other than before sunset which technically isnt another movie at all since its about the same two people and the same romancebr br this is love in the real world ok thats only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well and this is what makes before sunrise so good the dialog is perfect its so real so engaging and funny its hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love coz you fall in love with them at the very same timebr br my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend its perfect brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your lifebr br i must say that if you have a choice do watch before sunrise before watching before sunset if like me you watched sunset first its hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire showbr br once again the greatest romantic movie in my books wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations young love at its best
