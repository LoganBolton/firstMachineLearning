before sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top 5 favorite movies ever dialog and acting are great i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts of course the romantic vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you wont find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isnt possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if youre a stranger and its your first night in vienna but thats not the point the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring the ending is genuinely sad without being titanic or something even if you dont like love stories you should watch this film im a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer the first part is perfect as it is in my opinion
