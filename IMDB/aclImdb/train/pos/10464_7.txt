for all of you that dont speak swedish the swedish original title of this film rånarna translates into something in the line of the robbers this fact is the main problem i have with the film cause its not really about the robbers at all its about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies a regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers exactly weve seen this before the fact that theres a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesnt really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the filmbr br what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that its masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and dont overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the storybr br one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that its music sets the right mood when its needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and carchases spread throughout the film a nice touch the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that hes not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but thats something you have to neglectbr br all in all its an entertaining film that steals more money in its plot than time from you 710
