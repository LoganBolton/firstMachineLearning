even this early in his career capra was quite accomplished with his camerawork and his timing this is a thin story  and quite predictable at times  but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately the first part looks like a cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that  the rich prince will lose his fortunebr br nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace its easy to get caught up in the clich√©s then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living the ending is very predictable but satisfying i also want to compliment the titlewriting very witty and fun
