ill tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie and it was a whos who of the top canadian bands of the age we got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates we then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didnt care because the headliners were among our favourites at one point early in the afternoon i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics tshirt this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day theres nothing reasonable nor tastedetermined nor really anything except their fandom snotty of me isnt it so i in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is whale musicbr br desmond howl had it all its hard to say what hes lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks inand trite as it sounds breaks him outbr br canadian cinema suffers from several problems generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian leads to lower production values than american or british films and most people dont like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an american film next canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often fullfrontal makes something artistic im sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies especially late at night on the cbc knows exactly what im talking about its almost like a dont do this handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian filmmakers threw it out a long time agobr br in the 90s and 00s however some films such as bruce mcdonalds work and the brilliant crazy have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories whale music is such a film on the surface deeper than just its canadianisms its a deeply moving story of a man whos lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love and that redeems even the rheostatics
