i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music businesswho are now still trying to become adultsno more fansgroupiesmoney etcand they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular lifeas they see the new bands etc getting the spotlightit is almost like they have to begin anewthis film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70s and 80s are going through nowand thats where i find the film sad and depressingbut it portrays the life of an old rock starabandoned and lostin a believable waythe young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren outrageousand she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their 50s who have seen the rise and fall of bandspeople who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps inand popularity fadesthis is an almost perfect moviesad but in a way positivebecause of the whales a must see
