a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movies main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalbr br this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love storiesbr br in general im a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
