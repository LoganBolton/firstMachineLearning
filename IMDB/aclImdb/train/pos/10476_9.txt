my first exposure to whale music was the rheostatics album of the same name that i bought around 1993 i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album which remains in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by canadian author paul quarringtons bookbr br i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it an amazing read i have since reread the book numerous times each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale musicbr br i found the film in 1996 on video i havent had a lot of good experiences with canadian film but this one worked for me the role of claire could have been cast differently but overall i think that paul quarringtons vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screenbr br maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius the movie deals with family relationships love and finding someone who understands i would strongly recommend whale music to not only music fans but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world
