walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema how do you get laughs out of other peoples misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too longbr br well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since those other races used itundoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the worldbr br an extraordinary dvd extra commentarytwo of them in factrun thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take what a hoot dont miss it 910 stars
