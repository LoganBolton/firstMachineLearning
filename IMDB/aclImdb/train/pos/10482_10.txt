i love this film its one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesnt try too hard to be star studdedbr br the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completelybr br the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feelgood factor throughoutbr br it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes no thats not a spoiler
