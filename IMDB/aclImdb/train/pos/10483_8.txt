yes this movie is predictable and definitely not awardmaterial but then it doesnt try to be anything it is not a funfilled romp with real funny oneliners a stellar and very funny performance by peter otoole a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright the bands performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a deft comical manner the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads a good example is the comment about the strange baseballlike game well my dear american that was cricket from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket also no you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said oh yes to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money jeez it seems that every joke must be explained to some people allinall i enjoyed it and had some great laughs well worth seeing
