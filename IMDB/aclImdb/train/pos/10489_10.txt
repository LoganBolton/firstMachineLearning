this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you havent spent any time on that side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it eruptsbr br the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played shes a true lady and my favorite is graces white pimp suit that she wearsbr br i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different
