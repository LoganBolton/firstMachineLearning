i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then its become one of my favorites the plot isnt particularly complex but it doesnt take away from the entertainment its chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda blythen she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if youre looking for a good comedy id definately recommend this movie
