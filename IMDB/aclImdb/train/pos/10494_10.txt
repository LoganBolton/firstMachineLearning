excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town its mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldnt stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstorebr br i love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned devinebr br saving grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it
