its a bit easy thats about itbr br the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d but thats forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realisticbr br the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but its the same for every platform game like banjokazooie and donkey kong 64br br i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 and since then i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times
