i have not read the novel though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book having not read a single word of austens writing i really cant compare this to any of her work what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever witty and welldelivered as well as the biggest source of comedy in this this made me laugh out loud a lot with perfect british and verbal material every acting performance is spoton and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker the characters are wellwritten credible and consistent i did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny it tended to get repeated excessively and it honestly wasnt amusing the first time they appeared the editing and cinematography are marvelous and everything looks utterly gorgeous plot and pacing are great youre never bored it does end in a really obvious manner but maybe thats what the audience of these prefer i cant claim that this did not entertain me it did from start to finish and id watch it again there is brief language in this i recommend this to any fan of romance stories 710
