im a huge jane austen fan and besides being a featurelength film a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a miniseries it was really great gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but wellintentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr knightly with his poise and nobility i wasnt thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didnt feel it spoiled the movie at all like i said as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that werent but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well ive seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one
