well i guess im emotionally attached to this movie since its the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema  helping me through my masters thesis or rather keeping me from working on itbr br but on watching it again several years and many many movies later  what a wellcrafted little gem this is ive never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley  where does one meet such a man sigh sophie thompsons turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest oh napkins sorry and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either  toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming  and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect impossible couplebr br of course the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood almost hobbitonlike atmosphere of the movie  although as far as cinematography and art decoration go its almost a case of visual overload very very pretty but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period but the good thing is the movie doesnt take itself too seriously and there is plenty of fun  and some pretty cool editing  that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england modebr br my particular favorite is the ball scene  some beautiful acting and directing here and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long  cut two shots i can think of exactly which ones and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the moviebr br gosh i just realize by reading the imdb listings that ive seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him  seems hes got a lot more going for him as an actor than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob hmm guess i need to pay my video store a visitbr br lovely movie my favorite jane austen adaptation so far  though perhaps ang lees sense and sensibility is strictly speaking the better movie this one is closest to my heart  and ive certainly seen it many more times watch it if you can  and dont be too hard on its little imperfectionsbr br
