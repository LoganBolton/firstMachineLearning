this is a good adaptation of austens novel good but not brilliantbr br the cinematography is inventive crossing at times the border to gimmickry but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes given that the entire story is dialoguedrivenbr br the acting is competent ms paltrow is aloof as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her matchmaking endeavours some of the supporting cast is guilty of overacting  very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures personally i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton  to no fault of his own except for having left such an impression as a gay trolleydolly in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level
