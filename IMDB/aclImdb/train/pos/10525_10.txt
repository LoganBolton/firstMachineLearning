i have no idea how a texan the director douglas mcgrath and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms paltrow was in the first place i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscarwinning shakespeare in love performance but she gets all the beats right hereshe is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for thisbr br of course shes surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette greta scacchi juliette stevenson et aljeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on ewans hair is a little easier to take than it was in 96 and personally i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays but the standout is without a doubt sophie thompson sister of emma thompson daughter of phyllida law as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn the film is worth watching again even for her performance alonebr br all in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system well worth a rental because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good againbut well always have emma
