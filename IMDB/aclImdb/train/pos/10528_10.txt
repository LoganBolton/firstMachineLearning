i was so impressed with doug mcgraths film version of the jane austen novel emma and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had reunited for nicholas nickleby i immediately rented it without any other considerationbr br i have read the book and for those overlycritical fans of this jane austen adaptation i dont know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austens work especially given the limitations of a two hour movie which some have complained about being too long and as far as gwen paltrows accent is concerned i must confess i wasnt too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actressbr br i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside the films beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker then perhaps you should rent something like death wish iiibr br the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this storybr br this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex violence or even a villainous antagonist the story is often amusing endearing and at times quite touchingbr br i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite
