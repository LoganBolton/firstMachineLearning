whether its a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think it remembers me of i love huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond in a merry sadisticmasochist way  i hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarteàlacrème like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematography the color of cube was black nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of natali
