the only word that sums up this movie is quirky its a lighthearted romp through an existential concept bouncy in more way than one and a bit nutty i wouldnt exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesnt seem quite as memorable as the directors first movie cube but its a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe thats how it was to be written done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension a little like the matrix meets head meets human naturebr br 68 out of ten
