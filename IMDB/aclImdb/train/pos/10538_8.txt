i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the lookout for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and ive been trying to support my countrys movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationshipswithout working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges we cant be dead we have cable what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
