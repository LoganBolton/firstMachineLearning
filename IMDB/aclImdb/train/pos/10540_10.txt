i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good unless its just that was stupid i loved this film you just dont get to see gems like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do
