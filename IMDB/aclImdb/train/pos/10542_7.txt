tweaked a little bit nothing could be a childrens film its a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think ofwhat goes against everything more than literally nothing nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives all thats left is what they dont hate and a big empty white space its hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot it focuses on pretty much one subject but thats prime vincenzo natali territory if youve seen cube you know already that he tends to like that type of situation the nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because theres literally nothing else and nowhere else to go the actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway two actors from cube return here worth and kazan but are entirely different characters they change throughout the story and while theyre not the strongest actors in the world theyre at least believablebr br the reason i say this could be a childrens film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few fbombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isnt very much of it this couldve gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue there is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it i only say thats a shame because not because i support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposurebr br at any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few draggedout scenes but for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film
