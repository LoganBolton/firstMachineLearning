a lighthearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you dont like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didnt like about nothing and they werent even part of the main moviebr br first the postcredits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasnt really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of framebr br second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guessbr br if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades
