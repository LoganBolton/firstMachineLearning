director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for characterbased scifi flicks with his 1997 short film elevated wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building his followup feature project cube released later that year had a very similar premise this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps both were admirable attempts to take the scifi genre a step further by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element how the characters act react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002s cypher natali has come back to his bizarre characterfilm trend to bring us nothing his latest and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of what ifbr br dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller are lifelong friends brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with dave who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature lives rentfree with andrew at his illlocated and illconstructed house where he often takes advantage of andrews neurotic and antisocial mentality despite all this the two misfits are happy together until one day their deep character flaws coupled with some astronomically bad luck land them in the middle of some pretty serious jailsentenceworthy trouble on top of this they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset so in the hazy nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them they wish that the whole world would just disappear and it doesbr br going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the films slow occasionally too slow reveal about whats happened to dave and andrew and how they deal with their new reality natalis fascination with studying human behavior under duress ala the birds is here in spades but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers hes able to break away from the thrillerhorror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level its almost as if hes made the aphoristic opposite of cubebr br of course the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine in keeping with fundamental realism our two antiheroes dynamic often becomes antagonistic sometimes with rather nasty results like the desert island game the film looks at how even best friends when left alone together can fall apart but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence in a very twisted scifi way this is a feelgood flick with good heart and good intentionsbr br however there are a few qualms to be had with nothing while the two lead actors hewlett and miller do well with their parts their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew some background is given but ultimately not enough a generous viewer will sit through the lessengaging portions of the film to see it through to the end but cynics will probably give up pretty fastbr br acting as mentioned is adequate and considering the amount of greenscreen work that wouldve been needed reasonably convincing david hewlett and andrew miller who both wrote cowrote the screenplay have been longtime friends of vincenzo natali hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction nonetheless the story could have been a lot more involving granted it is relatively entertaining considering that no pun intended nothing really happens but you get the impression that in more experienced hands a lot more couldve been done with this premisebr br in all fairness nothing is an impressive piece of work in many ways the concept is interesting the direction is inventive the script works on a human level and most of all it shows a progression in natalis creative mentality for fans of his work this will be a delight and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time its just a shame that the directors fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great fun film it could have been
