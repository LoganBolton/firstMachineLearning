if you want mindless action hot chicks and a postapocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for youbr br the concept of dark angel isnt anything new in fact theres controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finishbr br jessica alba is smoking and max friends original cindy kendra are just as hot br br the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote itbr br in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if youre looking for hard hitting awardwinning drama go watch the west wing or something
