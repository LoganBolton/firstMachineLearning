i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk well actually it doesnt because this film is everything a hollywood film isnt  original creative quirky and humorous it seems that today noone really wants to see this type of movie as in the simplest terms it doesnt conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a filmbr br i havent written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes essentially it is about nothing as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only miseenscene consists of half a house and a vast white empty space this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their rolesbr br id love to write some more but am on quite a time limit however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and wellexecuted fashion with the combination of good performances a strong script nice sound design and fairly impressive visuals creating a very entertaining moviebr br its just a shame so few people know about nothing
