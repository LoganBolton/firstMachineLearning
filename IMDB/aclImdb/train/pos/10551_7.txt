sitting typing nothing is the latest what if fest offered by vincenzio natali and starring david hewlitt and andrew miller as two losers one is having relationship problems got canned from his job because of relationship problems and the police are out to get him because of his job and his relationship problems the other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was molested when he doesnt buy cookies from him oh yeah the police are after him too after the mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest himbr br man what a daybr br what if you could make all of this disappear that is the whole premise behind nothing the two fools realize the cops the girl scout the cars the lawn the road everything disappear theres nothing but white space this is an interesting concept i thought i also looked at the time of this 30 minutes had gone in the movie and i still had an hour left in the movie could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes although the actors try 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie but the two actors whom are lifelong friends with each other and the director have such great repertoire with each other that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do there are lots of supernatural elements but its more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing
