the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now weve all heard or read about it in some kind of context what would you do if you were all alone in the world what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes in fact the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew two roommates living in a rundown house in the middle of a freeway system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed just untilbr br straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them both of them get involved with crime andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesnt dare going out of the house dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues dont treat him very well and with the respect he deserves the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that is exactly what happensbr br the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still leftbr br nothing features an incredibly small cast  in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller in the entire film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of closeup head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well director of photography derek rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we dont see it right awaybr br obviously this cant be an event driven film and its not much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void and thats where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy barbr br now one could be thinking how does nothing look like well it looks like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look this is the weakness of this film after an hour or less its getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure its more interesting to look at thank god there are some for example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of tofu as andrew claims its fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little societybr br one of the best parts of the film is the set production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this all in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watchingbr br however the very best part of the film is the acting both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent oneliners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end  and this really moves the movie away from the lowbudget area to wellcrafted handworkbr br lets talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film theres a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although the drews have milked that scene completely its still fun to watch one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment  they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appearbr br nothing is a bright and welllit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory we dont know where they are or what has happened to them we dont know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that the ending by the way is not as good as it couldve been its rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end its a reasonably satisfactory onebr br take hollow man kill bill cube epoch and lots of other films and you have nothing it really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film at least that i know of nothing is really like for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube he talks about him and andr√© bijelic having been roommates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story and to that end its almost like one of the cube prequelsbr br what can i say i enjoyed nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely wellmade with tons of intelligent ideas still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is maybe if we have a nothing 2 i can answer that question nothing is a great film but not as good as i expected it to bebr br final rating 75  10
