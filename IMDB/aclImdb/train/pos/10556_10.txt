i wasnt sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this a smart slightly twisted comedy that makes you think i wasnt quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to mr natali and the brilliant individuals at core to create another low budget set that looks real as real as nothing can be well worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this please go youll be glad you did
