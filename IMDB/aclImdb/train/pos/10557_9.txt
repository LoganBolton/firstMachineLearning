just saw this at the 2003 vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this rundown house in the middle of a freeway system david hewlett pin cube cypher and andrew miller cube are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a lowbudget flick directorwriter vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and downtoearth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame
