i havent written a review on imdb for the longest time however i felt myself compelled to write this when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film do not pay any attention to this ignorant person nothing is a fantastic film full of laughs and above all imagination arent you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubblegum trash movies sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before i dont even care if you dislike even hate the movie but no one has a right to discredit the film imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that just say you hate it and why you hate it but dont try to tell people that they shouldnt watch it we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank youbr br if my judgment is any good id say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate itbr br treat your mind to a bit of eyecandy see nothing
