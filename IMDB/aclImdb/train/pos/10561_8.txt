089 footlight parade 1933  released 9301933 viewed 5507br br the ice cream cone is invented in new yorkbr br kevin after a long and busy break we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros this time its the ultrafast paced footlight parade starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent i am 100 certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute joan blondell is also excellent as the acidtongued secretaryturnedlove interest the ruby keelerdick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable one thing that baffled me was berkeleys performances themselves which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards obviously busby doesnt let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most overthetop musical numbers he can possibly conjure i liked nearly all of this movie until the end with the shamelessly offensive number shanghai lil which as one can guess is about as stomachturning as racially distasteful performances comebr br doug six movies in three months got to be a new record anywayÂ…this completes warner bros musical trilogy of 1933 preceded by 42nd street and gold diggers of 1933 i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie or if that the role as written was inspired by busby i hope it was it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does the funny thing about cagney was that he didnt really look like a leading man in the traditional sense he was 57 squareheaded and talked with an odd new york accent but the guy was quite versatile going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fasttalking producertypes we see here and he could dance basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor the rest of the cast has some familiar faces joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagneys loyal and lusting secretary dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple but seem to get less screen time than before billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp the movie is typical of the more racy and adultoriented musicals of the precode era as opposed to those of the 50s and 60s that were more family oriented and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year the shanghai lil number not withstanding with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinesebr br last film dinner at eight 1933 next film im no angel 1933
