a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible nonstop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell keeler is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress theres a freshness in the movie that you dont see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted 30s films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies prologues is quite dated
