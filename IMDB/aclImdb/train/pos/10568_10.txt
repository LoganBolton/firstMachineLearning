i loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyablebr br i do as a singer and musical director question one section of roby keelers vocal in by a waterfall the key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tinlike higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocalsbr br does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer it sounds it to me i would love to knowbr br thanks so much
