james cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot soft characters in his career this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star inbr br cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it he plays the role with a lot of confidence he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time so it actually isnt a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him inbr br the movie is directed by lloyd bacon who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre his earliest 30s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as 42nd street his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really 30s musicals never were really about its singing this was something that more featured in 40s and later made musicals mainly from the mgm studiosbr br as usual it has a light and simple story set in the musical world that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch so do the characters and actors that are portraying them sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routinesbr br the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done even though im not a too big fan of the genre itself once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty he often played little boysbabiesmice and whatever more early on in his career including the movie musical gold diggers of 1933 of one year earlier br br a recommendable early genre moviebr br 810
