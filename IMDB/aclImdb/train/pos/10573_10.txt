an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s audiences mustve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle quite a contrast from his public enemy 2 years earlier cagney does add spark  interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline  plot but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back first with the conservative honeymoon hotel numberthen followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling by a waterfall sequencefollowed by the closing shanghai lil sequence cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler the shanghai lil number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown  anti climactic after the more exciting  incredibly mind boggling by a waterfall choreographyif i was the director i wouldve inserted the shanghai lil number in the middle  close with by a waterfallwhich blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak  in my view the best of the 3 numbers the 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake  james cagneys performance is added decoration to the cake an outstanding musical achievementa 4 star movie the ultimate musicalwell worth watchingyou wont be disappointed
