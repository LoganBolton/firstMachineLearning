when it came out this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment to this day its more entertaining than most in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty girl friday played by joan blondell also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knockout as far as that type of thing goesbr br but this is a pretty strange movie i mean in one of those numbers youve got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler doing all kinds of weird stuff ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times but at least shes not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films youd never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney as for cagney his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time after a while it gets a bit too much you expect him to walk out and say hey ive got a great idea for a prologue the women are cigarettes and they come out of a pack of smokes oh no we did that one last month its funny but it gets a bit repetitive in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl ruth donnelly some of the established cagney gangster character comes out in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very street even though the characters arent criminalbr br the musical numbers what can you say they stand alone as entertainment the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling but none of them really mean anything it means honeymoon hotel nothing really more or less and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately since the characters in the show are doing things that couldnt possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper things like that the whole thing could only exist on film so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so because this is a very polished productionbr br its great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well the music i would say is only mediocre but mostly pleasing if repetitive bacons direction in general is very suitable but never interesting the films entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way its a cut above most lets put on a show films of the 30s
