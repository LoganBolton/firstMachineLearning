pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundybr br this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british stalwarts especially stanley holloway makes this more believablebr br there are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to thembr br even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer doesnt mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feelingbr br its amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later the producers must have got something right
