every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state i do not think this is the point of the film at all the film parodies the spivssmall time criminals who ran the blackmarket and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisationbr br yes of course the film sends up the politicalsocial situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair societythey want to be british and muddle through rather than foreignbr br but i dont think they go back to being exactly like they were before
