i commend pictures that try something different many films just seem like retreads of old ideas so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlicobr br the movie is set just after ww2 and the postwar shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners barmy the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico they too are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago with this document they reason they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want since it turns out they really arent british subjects where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something youll need to see for yourselves leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem
