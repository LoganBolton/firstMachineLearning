i love this show its sure to be a winner jessica alba does a great job its about time we have a kickass girl whos not the cutesy type the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots everything is layed out well and thought over to put it together must have taken a while because it wasnt someone in a hurry that just slapped something together its a great show altogether
