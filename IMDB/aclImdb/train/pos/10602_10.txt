i have to say i totally loved the movie it had its funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because its something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting namecalling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldnt really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
