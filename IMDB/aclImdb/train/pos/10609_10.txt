i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and lowkey but deeply heartfelt henry thomas he played the child in et performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that were talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesnt act or have lines but rather just is  is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas mysterious relationship w et was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good babybr br then there is the musicah what music gillian welchs tunes are wonderful  the entire score is gorgeous hill country musicbr br this film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly
