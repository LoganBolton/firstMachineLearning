what another reviewer called lack of character development i call understatement the movie didnt bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory yes there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a oneday snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters lives henry thomass performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action good rental
