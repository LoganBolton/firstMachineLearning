three girls an allfemale mediacrew including cultactress barbara bach no less visiting a small town to cover a festival end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague wellmade little shocker suffering a bit from some redundant dialoguescenes and a rather thin plotline that doesnt do very well in hiding its secrets one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing as in vintage shockmaterial and this is basically what the film thrives on performances  cinematography are pretty much above par compared to many other late 70searly 80s films in the same vein but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climaxscene in the basementsetting from the moment that keller junior character was introduced his performance made my jaw drop open and it didnt close until the end of the film a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick who was funnily wacko in one flew over the cuckoos nest and now utterly demented in the unseen take on one of the leading roles
