hatred of a minute is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years not to say that its a brilliant film by any means but its definitely worth a watchbr br  hatred chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver played by director kallio a formerly abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil sidebr br  hatred is very nice visually the shots are creative and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at this film actually has an element of production value to it unlike other recent michigan releases like dark tomorrow and biker zombies subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this films 350000 budgetbr br  however hatred stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do and thats in the story and character department essentially things just kindof happen eric seaver doesnt evolve at all basically hes always been crazy its just that people are starting to notice the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development also the ending is very abruptbr br  however since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot we just want to see people die and hatred certainly delivers as the body count mounted people in the theater started cheering kill her kill em all when people scream back at the screen its always funbr br  thats the place where hatred succeeds its fun and in the end thats all that really matters
