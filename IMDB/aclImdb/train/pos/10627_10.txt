so what constitutes a real independent film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge im sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploybr br which is why we should be glad that films like hatred of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film love it or hate it hatred isnt afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that kallio the director didnt just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place hes in this to tell stories good ones you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but dont be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that ohsodistant light at the end of the tunnelbr br if you expect smut or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the finer points of the horrorsuspense genres check this film outbr br yes bruce campbell did produce this movie and im sure hes proud to tell anyone that its not evil dead bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and its obvious that he didnt get involved with hatred so that it could do so eitherbr br my advice though to all deadites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr kallio and mr campbell are trying to show youbr br the acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally its good to see compassionate performances in a horror film so often actors in films such as these dont even seem to try with hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horrorfilm campinessbr br technically hatred is about as competent as indie film gets the editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and hatred keeps a quick pace without any bogdown points or bad anticlimaxesbr br all in all hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multimillion dollar fake indies but personally i dont see a problem with that its a film by folks who actually care about the medium people who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good moviebr br check this one out
