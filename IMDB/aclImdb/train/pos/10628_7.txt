despite the occasionally stilted acting and seenitallbefore story this is a fairly compelling moviebr br it has suspense the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy some of the visual effects are superb and best of all no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film as too many wannabe horror films have in them nowbr br honestly this isnt the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character developmentbr br i was glad i watched it
