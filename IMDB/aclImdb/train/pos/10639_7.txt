dolph lundgren is back detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years and that is following the delayed hidden agenda this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips agent red and stormcatcher however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda which was better in almost every respect what this film does have in its favour from dolphs previous outing is a sense of cheesy fun the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role and its good to see dolph doing his own stunts againbr br the films story is ludicrous and prime bmovie material an exmilitary man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching whilst taking a detention class he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy thankfully the filmmakers dont take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability this film has a so bad its enjoyable kind of vibebr br where the film is let down is missusing a fairly decent budget the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent its all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse there are some good moments you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning with plenty of destruction the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen br br as for the cast hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film this however has problems the actors are on the most part bad the bad guys are terrible but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters they all hate authority each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability this movie is all about dolph though while this film is nowhere near his best it is nowhere near his worst it also marks a turning point in his career he is now back in good shape and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action dolph looks enthusiastic here he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slowmo one liners and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one it is good to see dolph looking energised his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary and using doubles a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new streamlined dolph seems up for itbr br overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode theres not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm
