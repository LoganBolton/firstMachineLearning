i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw it was a cool fun moviedolph looked superbly cool on the bikehe also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movieshe is now in a pretty good shapethe story was ok and the other actors were also passablei wouldnt call this movie his best but its still a good moviebr br but it also had its share of problems the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the targetthey shouldve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers there shouldve been more bad guys last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy  but that was due to the small budget overall the movie was a good moviei enjoyed iti would recommend others to watch it ps now u r a dead beat cop some oneliners were also coolbr br
