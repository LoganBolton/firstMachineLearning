jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts  one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budgetbox office ones its a mere 70 minutes and doesnt feature many sets and the only star is barbara stanwyck but what a star of course br br stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help some psychological battling there br br its a surprisingly effective little movie  its short length makes it taut and that stanwyck is great should go without mention but ill still praise her every time
