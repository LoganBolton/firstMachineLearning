i like cheap perfume better it doesnt last as long  ralph meekers convict character lawson tells this to barbara stanwycks helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out wher husband in tijuana this line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film  that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfumeloving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run i agree with some of the other comments posted about helens attraction to lawson even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldnt likely wash away with the tide
