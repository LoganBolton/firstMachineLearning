leonard maltin mustve been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then fizzles when its really the reverse  starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad incapacitated in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear lifebr br good whiteknuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker appearing suddenly the director john sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the films narrative and speeds off with the top down his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying pretty neat huh when hes especially pleased with his misdeeds there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage barbara stanwyck dont go away she fires back where would i go theyre in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcomishly yeah thats right the friction between them is a hootbr br there are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones theres one scene where the police who have been chasing after meeker for some time stop stanwycks car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as shes being questioned a he looks conspicuously unmasculine in this pose and b i think its safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicionbr br still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusionbr br
