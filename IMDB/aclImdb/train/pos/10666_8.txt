when i really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven i had a big list of must see films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts i remember one of the films on that list was a chorus line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come truebr br of course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there i mean take a chorus line a stage play turned into film i know its something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something specialbr br most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places a chorus line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach michael douglas richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the jobbr br everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go bybr br like a movie i saw recently a prairie home companion the broadcast of a radio show atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop again i dont if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesnt look like it and anyway its a great directing and editing john bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting ronnie taylors cinematography finds the way making closeups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new yorkbr br in one crucial moment douglas tells the ones that are left before we start eliminating youre all terrific and id like to hire you all but i cant this made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good its hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrificbr br to tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman which is very touching at times so if its not with a song it will be with a word but in a chorus line its impossible not to be movedbr br during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition cassie a special dancer played by alyson reed takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it the words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics
