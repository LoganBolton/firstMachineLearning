ive long wanted to see this film being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum i agree that the romantic subplot was a waste of time but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s some of the boys are a bit scary i certainly wouldnt want to met them on a welllit street much less a dark one there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly
