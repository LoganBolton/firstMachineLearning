this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpools junior liaison officers the opening title points out that 92 of potential delinquents who have been dealt with under this scheme have not committed a second crime however this becomes merely a pretext to the following teendrama until the films epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldnt feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixedup they might seembr br stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer this hardboiled character is a role typical of baker having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer however as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events back to his original investigationbr br his first case leads him to the home of two young children mary and patrick murphy played by reallife brother and sister duo who have committed a petty theft here he meets cathie satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such innercity estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquencybr br the elder brother of the murphy family johnny is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums mccallum does an eyecatching turn as the americanized mixedup kid who owes more to the likes of marlon brando than any previous british star one is reminded of brandos character johnny from the wild one who led a leatherclad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this films johnny leads his gangbr br thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as the blue lamp is not so apparent instead we are presented with several well drawnout characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefrontbr br the plot whilst at times predictable does deliver some memorable scenes the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children including mary and patrick are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny obviously in the light of the reallife dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences
