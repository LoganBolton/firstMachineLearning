this is a better than average silent movie and its still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents however if you arent yet a fan of the genre i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one thats because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots but despite this its still a good film and kept my interestbr br a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief despite this she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life however the rent is due and theres no money so the lady is forced to look for work she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal unfortunately the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party cant make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the mans date well like cinderella she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her what to do nowgiven that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her well see the movie yourself to see how its all resolved i didnt like how they handled the husband as it seemed awfully predictable and clich√©d however once he was out of the way i do admire how the film also didnt give up a bythenumbers finale and left the film with a few loose endsbr br all in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great
