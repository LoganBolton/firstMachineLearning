i didnt really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet that and it had nicole kidman in it i absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking wowbr br refreshingly down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few suprises at each corner the relationships in the film are believeable with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully the humour is subtle with some great officelike scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being hollywoodbr br overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation its less about heroics and more about delicate relationships britfilmmaking at its bestbr br 910
