i think dark angel is great first season was excellent and had a good plot with maxjessica alba as an escaped x5 manticore creation trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spicebr br the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first the plot kinda disappeared and the series lost a little of its charm mostly because of all the weird creatures appearing dont get me wrong the second season is good but with a little bit to much of the manticores however they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 in which i had a lot of hopes to see more ofbr br so i really wish they could start making new episodes and with james cameron behind this it cant go wrong so as a conclusion i would say its a great series however im still hoping for a third season
