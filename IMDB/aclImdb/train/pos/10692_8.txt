good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman i almost always like the movies shes in this was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy truth about cats  dogs maybe theyre too implausible ebert didnt even post a review for this the great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible bringing up baby etc if youve seen one implausible comedy youve seen them all or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s weird birthday girl is a movie ive enjoyed several times nicole kidman may be the killer app for home video
