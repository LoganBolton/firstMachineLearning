ive had a lot of experience with women in russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately they are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair from the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal ive experienced it all in russiabr br i know what im talking about and here are my qualifications here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met black comedy scams i was privy to and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tvbr br httpwwwhappierabroadcomphotojournalshtmbr br its like reality tv you will love it i spent a ton of time putting it together so check it out the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournalsbr br my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why dont they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia however there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport it doesnt work that way at all so i dont understand why the media likes to perpetuate this there isnt a single russian bride introduction website that works this way and i challenge anyone to find one that does the fact is you can only order the russian ladys contact info email address phone number etc from the website from there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your ins office and wait months after that thats how it works in real life you cant just order her to arrive at your airport us immigration would never allow such a thing to happenbr br wumaster br br  i got everything i wanted by going abroad you can too httpwwwhappierabroadcom
