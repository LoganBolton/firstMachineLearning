i bought dark angel seasons 1  2 two weeks ago after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i havent enjoyed anything as much since firefly also and amazing show ill admit season 2 wqasnt quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes see designate this bag em the berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is great ive heard some of the plans for the wouldbe season 3 and i have to say i cant believe it was cancelled  i wont spoil it for you  but it would have rocked i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie although at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my obsessiveness maxs barcode number is 332960073452 and in the two weeks ive had it i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice its just too good
