the critics didnt like this film it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain which was a great shame because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain firstbr br nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from the graduate and birthday girl has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic despite being a totally different storybr br sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure  but its memorable moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average megabudget blockbusterbr br see it with an open mind
