the trailer for this movie didnt do the movie justice and while the movie didnt know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be this movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be kidman being one of my favorites of course im biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better three out of four stars 9502
