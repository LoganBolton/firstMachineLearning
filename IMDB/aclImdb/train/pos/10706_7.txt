this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching the story is engaging and it doesnt take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention the acting is first class and the characters are represented well sometimes it feels like the director couldnt decide himself between drama and romantic comedy ben chillers portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn sm magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs as does the look in nicole kidmans eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant
