for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good its another one of these modernday british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc its not wild like snatch but its interesting and it has some rough charactersbr br it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show  not late  has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the firsttime viewer basically its about a lowkey british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprisesbr br ben chapin and nicole kidman costar and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidmans russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and wellacted kidman once again proves shes far more than just a beautiful face
