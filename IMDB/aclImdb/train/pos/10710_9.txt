i really have to disagree with guyyardleyrees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant wholebr br this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feelbr br i cant say how much standard films bore me  pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesnt seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish filmbr br ok so the acting isnt in the style a blockbuster thats because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing  and at times unusually beautifulbr br seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around  that really do feed into the endingbr br overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and nonnormal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please
