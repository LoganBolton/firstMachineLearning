this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but its a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here its not the father but his grandfather who tells the storiesbr br the movies narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie its funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldnt expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
