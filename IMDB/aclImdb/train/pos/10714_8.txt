the scots excel at storytelling the traditional sort many years after the event i can still see in my minds eye an elderly lady my friends mother retelling the battle of culloden she makes the characters come alive her passion is that of an eyewitness one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she livesbr br of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldnt guess from the way she tells it the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig a local cut in to give his version the discussion continued to closing timebr br stories passed down like this become part of our being who doesnt remember the stories our parents told us when we were children they become our invisible world and as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir fact and fiction blend with aspiration role models warning stories archetypes magic and mysterybr br my name is aonghas like my grandfather and his grandfather before him our protagonist introduces himself to us and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations it produces stories within stories stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland its rugged mountains shrouded in mists the stuff of legend yet seachd is rooted in reality this is what gives it its special charm it has a rough beauty and authenticity tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hearbr br aonghas angus visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death he burns with frustration part of him yearns to be in the twentyfirst century to hang out in glasgow but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelicspeaking communitybr br yet there is a deeper conflict within him he yearns to know the truth the truth behind his grandfathers ancient stories where does fiction end and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parentsbr br he is pulled to make a last fateful journey to the summit of one of scotlands most inaccessible mountains can the truth be told or is it all in storiesbr br in this story about stories we revisit bloody battles poisoned lovers the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth in doing so we each connect with angus as he lives the story of his own lifebr br seachd the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made like angus i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories but also like angus i forgave this once i saw the bigger picture forget the boxoffice pastiche of braveheart and its like you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man to see a film that is true to scotland this one is probably unique if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough you might even reevaluate the power of storytelling and the ageold question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced
