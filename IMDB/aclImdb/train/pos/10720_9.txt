hurrah a space film that doesnt take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and highfliers mixed together into a dodgy soup but when the going gets tough  the tough get themselves sorted out and its not an unbelievable change in the characters as you can believe that theres some responsibility in their young mindsbr br the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the im right and youre all wrong instructor i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote
