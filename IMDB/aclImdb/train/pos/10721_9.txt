this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies everbr br i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally bitchin belt and stick on rhinestones on her facebr br but anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest i know that the begining drags particuarly if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family filmbr br i wouldnt stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but ill admit it here with the internet to hide behindbr br
