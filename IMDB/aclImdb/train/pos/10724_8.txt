this is one of those feel good saturday afternoon movies its right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up and its fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson not to mention joquin phoenixbr br i personally really like movies like this from time to time nothing too deep or too scary just a nice story line and i would have never known mr phoenix had i not recently read the credits he was just a baby really when he made this moviebr br kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie i agree its not an oscar caliber movie but very much worth watching especially if you have kids in the  lets say 8 to 11 year old range or ones that are interested in the space program
