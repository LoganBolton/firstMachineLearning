space camp is a pretty decent film the plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the timebr br this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster and that really put a hamper on how popular it wasbr br the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a tv it just looks average i remember this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were really up therebr br this would be a good film to see on imax but im sure that will never happen
