spoilers 911 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of itbefore 911 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon changeas one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing planethis is the only footage of the first impacthe rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the buildingas the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accidentin the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possiblein the meanwhile we hear banging soundsthese are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the groundthis is the most grueling moment in the documentarythen the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his lifeyou hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the buildingthen a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns blackhe was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybodys memoryi saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon ofso this makes it even more realistic to watch 1010
