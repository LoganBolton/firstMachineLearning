it took us a couple of episodes to get into dark angel as a story and a series since we were transitioning from the sopranos a very different mentality framework but once we got with the gist of the series we were very quickly hooked its a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the antidiscrimination message from being rubbed in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who dont like to be lectured during entertainment but every event and humansocietal interaction remains relevant to the present we all make judgments face our own prejudices but in the end the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it for those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series empowers them for those whove never had to face the question this series sneaks in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment it is much more wellmade and wellwritten than most tv series im highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear
