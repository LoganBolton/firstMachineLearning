to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed i disagree this is an amazing documentary about a shocking daybr br imdb asks us to rate this movie i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachothers safety to judge whether its nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer i just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the otherbr br i submit a wholehearted 10 this is why the art of filming was created to capture the natural emotion that real life offers you can keep your kungfu junk romance is cute action will never reach this level this movie 911 will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself it didnt have a sneakpeek it didnt have all of the blatant vanities that a lions share of the many movies on the many screens blare it had class composure substance and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera please consider this movie as it itself proclaims a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free beautiful name of americabr br how can you give anything less to a movie that shows not embellishes the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times i love the godfather but 911 is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world it is art without question or questionsbr br jf
