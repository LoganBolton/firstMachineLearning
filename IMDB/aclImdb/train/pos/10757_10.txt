warning mild spoilers aheadbr br yes i realize its tough to spoil an historical documentary but i do reveal some of the backstory and methodsbr br this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage but also due to the story behind it because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of 911 but rather that of a rookie firefighter the mens emotions and the viewers connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective br br in a filmmaking sense 911 is textbook if the events were an actual script they would be superb as the characters are established then thrown a curve to which they must react this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together br br the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans that part alone is quite good and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course it probably would have been solid the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter br br then of course all hell breaks loose the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations seeing not only the attacks but also the firsthand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion br br the aftermath in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found is human drama at its peak life and death hang in the balance unlike many movies the viewer not only doesnt know who will live and die but genuinely cares about them br br the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro whom i like blurbs were uninformative unnecessary and didnt advance the story at all they were probably added just to attract more television viewersbr br bottom line the best documentary ive ever seen nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama 95 out of 10
