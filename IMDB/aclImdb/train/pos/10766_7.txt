a thin story with many fine shots eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the dream team and to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil businesscouple intending to poison the world with antrax original in this movie is the brabomb put on a captured member of the dreamteam of course she is rescued by a comember three seconds before explosion although clearly lent from james bonds goldfinger and you only live twice such a climax always works well all in all a nice watch james bond replaced here by three charlies angels
