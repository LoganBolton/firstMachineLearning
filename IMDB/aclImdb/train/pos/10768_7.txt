i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title until one day i was scrolling through john candys film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named once upon a crime something rang a bell and i clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memoriesbr br ive found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy it is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrillsbr br the movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an american couple who find a womans dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward  only to find her dead body upon arrival from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killersbr br kind of a mix between its a mad mad mad mad world and a lighter hitchcock feature this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends  such as john candy  to star in it the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isnt totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
