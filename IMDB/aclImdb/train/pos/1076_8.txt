superslick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching 1950s at the time rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens but whatever the value of those shadowy downers they reflected a wartime mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era few films of the late40s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedybr br jim blandings cary grant works as an adman on madison ave where in his little daughters words he sells things to people that they dont need at prices they cant afford hes making good money but like thousands of others hes tired of living in a cramped urban cave so with wife myrnah loy they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashionbr br theres hardly a lifeless line in the entire script i dont know if writers panama and frank got an oscar but they should have of course the humor revolves around all the problems that popup when city people build a big house on rural land the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant so its just one wellplaced laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic highpoint instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they dont peak at any particular point thats a real movie triumph for any erabr br reaching back 60 years later we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind with their livein maid the blandings may not be a typical american family but that postwar migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an adman tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ham more than anything however theres the movies sunny optimism oh sure the feeling falters at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day its that easily overlooked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the postwar periodbr br so if you havent seen it catch it next time around
