now this show looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid90s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i cant understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to datebr br my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itbr br anyway i would recommend if you hadnt seen it to find the dvd of all 13 episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
