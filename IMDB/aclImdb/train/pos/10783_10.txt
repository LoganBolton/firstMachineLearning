i enjoyed this movie havent seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly ive associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that hes versatilebr br i wasnt troubled that dottys anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook there are zillions of whateverphobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms she is clearly a sensitive with extrasensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentricbr br although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems also hirams twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle its fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance
