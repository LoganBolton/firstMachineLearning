this incredibly formulaic flick from the walker texas ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie in addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the getgo however its a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains thats all it was meant to do and it does so the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isnt half bad the acting is also decent which isnt much of a surprise because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal if youre a fan of the genre and of walker texas ranger you will definitely love this if not then dont waste your time 810
