there are a few spoilers in this commentbr br contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly seriesbr br i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while ill admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being airedbr br the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed i do fail to see how that many professionals werent able to hit a moving target but the action was definitely there and deke being the hero had to survivebr br as for the comment about needing to get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001 a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the usbr br if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it maybe they would have realized the plot of the story rashid a bin laden like character planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states the presidents man was called in to locate and eliminate the problembr br perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on itbr br
