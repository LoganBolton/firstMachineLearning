ooverall the movie was fairly good a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes but chuck norris did hardly anything except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters the movie was very similar to the events of sept 11 with a bin ladenlike terrorist sending a video to the president urich and threatening to detonate it judson mills had some superb action roles taking out rashids compound and various kickbutt roles but there was a lack of chuck norris judson took over most of the action leaving joshua chuck with que on her computer but overall it was realistic and didnt lack the action but only did it on mr norris part i gave the film 710
