first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when and i must say that after seeing it i could never forget jennifer welles at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film but when jennifer made her entrance the first time i ever saw her anywhere i was sat up and took notice her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene shes involved in ive seen most of the rest of sarnos films and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best sarnos direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see costars rebecca brooke aka mary mendum and chris jordan both frequent costars of ms welles and also frequent stars of sarnos work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives this film is sarno classic
