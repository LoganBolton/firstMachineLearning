im on the opposite end of the previous commentbr br first of all i dont think this was intended to be a straight sequel to the jerk i mean its not titled the jerk 2 its the jerk too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different personbr br think about it virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that its a partial musicalbr br i say give this movie some credit it does have plenty of laughs in it mark blankfield at his prime
