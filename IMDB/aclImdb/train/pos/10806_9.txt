i felt this film  throughout i waas impressed with russell crowes talent in developing his relationship with lillie such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach a bit self depreciating and very persistent really loved the cinematography and direction pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressivebr br gosh didnt russells talent even in 1993 shine  and i have yet to see gladiator
