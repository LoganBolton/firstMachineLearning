japanese tomo akiyamas keko mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequels but i havent seen them since these films are hyper rare some kind of rereleases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizardwhatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed well the main thing about the film is its name keko mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background the most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say keko mask unknown while the actor names are listedbr br the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies she has a gorgeous but lethal vagina yes you read right she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like ive never seen such a beautiful vagina and now i can die in peace this film is totally fantasticbr br there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films japanese censors optically fogblur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc theres one great scene in which one nerd sees girls bare youknowwhat for the first time and says hey theres no fog in it i couldnt help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this also one character says in the end that he will return if japan films allows to make the sequel im glad it allowed as ive heard the sequels are equally outrageous one sequel should include blues brothers yes those blues brothers in it etcbr br this is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find this would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i dont mention here and it wouldnt be even necessary to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek i think youll love this little gem as i do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 810 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal
