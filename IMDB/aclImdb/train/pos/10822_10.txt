i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england ive seen hundreds of films sincebut ive never forgotten this onealthough sinatra was playing a not very endearing characterhe was excellent in the rolea lot of people seem to think that he didnt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in conchothe other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conradid never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this filmi remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his characteralso i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appearsan excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatras blue shirt
