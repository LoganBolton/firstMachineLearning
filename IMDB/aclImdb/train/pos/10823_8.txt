ive always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this onebr br when we first meet frank in the films title role hes the brother of a notorious gunfighter whos out of town at the moment the brother strikes terror in the hearts of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him shes the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adamsbr br two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatras brother and hes coming to his town to take over they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town kirk follows himbr br overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone its a well acted performance almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm pity for some reason this has not been seen for yearsbr br two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen hes a villain of incredible malevolence pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screenbr br however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with lets just say i believe johnny concho was mgms answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order
