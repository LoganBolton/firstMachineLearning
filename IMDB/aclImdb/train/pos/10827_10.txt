still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about washup rr groups actually here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie people who expect spinal taplike attempt on satire would be disappointed by the lighthearted nature of the movie but id take a successful selfironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap
