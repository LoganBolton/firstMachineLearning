an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and its clear that the actors enjoyed filming this moviebr br its not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funnybr br i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i cant help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big  and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later
