this movie maked me cry at the end i watch at least 34 movies a week i seen loads of great movies even more crap  ones but when ending scene  catharsic at its core  came i cried and if you didnt  you have serious problems the story is archetypal  nothing new or original but its real  because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist glam isnt my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70s at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine docudramas never really work very good but this movie really meked us believe it allbecause they dont try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts present musicians that are superheroes groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb they dont glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late once again great movie since leaving las vegas i was never so moved by a movie
