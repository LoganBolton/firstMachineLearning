i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must see for any fan of 70s rock i hope me and my friends arent like that in twenty yearsbr br bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spiritbr br stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding wellbr br if you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you you wont regret seeing this movie i know i dont even my family found it funny and thats saying something
