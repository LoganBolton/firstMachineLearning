i agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings its trippy nighy was fab in his role nail nailed it beano was the typical drummer and rea kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet aubreys performance was gorgeous the scenes between aubrey  robinson killed me perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out they ought toive told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy nails character its supposed to be rock  roll not the phantom of the fg opera
