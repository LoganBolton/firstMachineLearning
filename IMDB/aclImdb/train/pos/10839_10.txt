i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever sincebr br the plot has been welldiscussed so no need in going over it again the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings americans especially arent going to get all the jokes the first time around i know i didntbr br this movie is funny touching sad all at the same time when ray proposes the toast at his daughters wedding its cringeinducing when karen calls tony brian as he attempts to kiss her its heartbreaking when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black its too funny for wordsbr br and the music its as good as any movie soundtrack ive heard in years i was dancing in the living room to all over the world br br every performance is absolutely perfect bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray a man who has had one too many bad trips stephen rea is perfect as tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him but all the actors are equally brilliantbr br ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it its a gem
