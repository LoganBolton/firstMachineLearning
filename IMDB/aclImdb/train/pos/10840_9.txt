in the voice over which begins the film hughiebilly connolly a roadie for the great 70s band strange fruit said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruits set was that god was sick of 70s excess indeed its been popular to put down that era of music and see punk as a welcome antidote to it while i agree the excess was tiresomeas well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it and like punk i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock and this film about strange fruits long strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those daysbr br one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes brian gibson directed whats love got to do with it about tina turnerwhile i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film the music was handled very well writers dick clement and ian le frenais cowrote the commitments and were behind the musicoriented british tv show over the rainbow and the songs strange fruit played were cowritten by foreigners mick jonesnot to be confused with the clashs mick jones so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about also two cast members are musicians in their own rightbill nye i dont know about though the film credits him with his own singing and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was musicoriented though i forget the name and he was in evita and the others are convincing at it and while as i said a lot of 70s bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women the movie doesnt make the same mistakeexcept for the woman who follows timothy spall around as the manager of the reunion juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded characterbr br the other actors are all good as well with special praise to stephen rea who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality there are a couple of plot points which dont work but overall this is quite enjoyable oh yeah and the music is good too
