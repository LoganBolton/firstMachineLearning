what a good movie at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock illusions of fame wellknown rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music and with a good sense of humour have you ever danced on bill haleys rock around the clockbr br anyway still crazy is probably the best movie about rock nroll i have ever seen far much better than spinal tap for instance why because in still crazy people are mature they have a different point of view about rock about love and about life they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams like anyone of usbr br spend a good time watching this listen to the awesome soundtrack and finally thinking of your own futurebr br bye
