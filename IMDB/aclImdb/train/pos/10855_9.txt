looking back over the past 28 years since my first exposure to the show all i can say is once you get itit will stay with you forever i remember my initial reaction being 1 annoyingly overacted 2under produced 3 unlikeable charactersbr br well two years later i watched some episodes again and didnt find it nearly as annoying a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in its bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness yes the show has a style that is not for everybody and im sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now but i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times br br btw i am a married manfor all who think this is a show for females
