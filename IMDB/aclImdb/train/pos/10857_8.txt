johny to makes here one of his best style exercises making a strong film with a good yakuzas story the election of the new yakuzas boss is the beginning of a war inside the organizationbr br in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film i specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the yakuzas family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problemsbr br talking about the technical aspects the film is a good example of paused rythmic and planified way of shooting a film one of the hong kong films of the year is like infernal affairs but without the easy actionviolence scenes and the confused storyline strongly recommended to all asian films loversbr br sorry for my english better do in spanish lol
