this isnt as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effectivebr br there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know whos side a particular character is onbr br the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it followsbr br the violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisationbr br the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable
