personally i find the movie to be quite a good watch it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organizedbr br not only that it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police dont just go all out and wipe out triadsbr br overall the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings  torture nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happensbr br id recommend this movie to any triadmafia movie fan another good watch would be dragon squad that movie has more guns than this as in this movie theres more knives than guns in fact i dont remember seeing a single gun
