this film really deserves more recognition than its getting it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties favours and allegiances within the crime world the film is shot beautifully and delves into all youre classic crime themes such as betrayal and power this film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china it features an arrangement of great characters actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film all in all 810 great plot characters but there are characters that dont stand out enough and the music didnt really get me going and at times i felt it didnt sync well with the actionthere is action by the way so it loses some points for that
