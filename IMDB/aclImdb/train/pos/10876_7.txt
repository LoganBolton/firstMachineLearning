i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrongbr br this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful moviebr br the acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty badbr br when i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream 2 but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good moviebr br warning major spoilersbr br probably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasnt even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror moviebr br dont see this film youll probably be disappointed
