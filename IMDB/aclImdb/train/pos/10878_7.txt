personally i enjoyed cut thouroughly it was the first time ive seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood filmsbr br with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasnt a rip off of anything i didnt even think it was really a spoof of other movies it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief i think its about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genresbr br cut was original scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun id give it seven out of ten and wouldnt treat it as anything serious it did what i expected it to do entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying i enjoyed it
