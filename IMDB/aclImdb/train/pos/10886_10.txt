when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasuretype movies the first thing i think of are 80s slasher flicks really bad slasher flicks the formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get madebr br flash forward to the late 90searly 00s the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996s scream like in the 80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongueincheek parodies of the original slasher flicks of this recent blend of hip parody neoslasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the lowbudget directtovideo cutbr br like most of the other new slasher flicks cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film hot blooded to make its commentary on the genre hot blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the films killer scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupilless eyes now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot scarman returns and someone dies to quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes thembr br this all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick there is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of hot bloodeds original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this wouldve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet its never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about the actors arent great even by directtovideo standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who arent its inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on hot blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman cuts climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the scream films it doesnt have the gimmick killings of the urban legend films what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending but thats par for the coursebr br by any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neoslasher flicks
