a horror movie is being shot and things arent going well its about a masked killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and kills two people hes killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish itbut theres a curse people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens nextbr br the plot is old hat but this isnt badfor what it is a low budget slasher film its wellmade with a young and fairly talented young cast no one is great but no one is terrible either it also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes it moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesnt insult your intelligence also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actressbr br no great shakes but not bad at all i give it a 7
