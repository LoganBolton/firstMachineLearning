whats with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day when i saw that drew ben affleck might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry youll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom james gandolfini and alicia christina applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs however this film did make me smile and feel good inside before i wrap this up id like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit now in conclusion i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasnt seen it
