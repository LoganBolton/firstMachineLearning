cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budgetbr br there are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience as he makes his exit he assures the client grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of 10000 from the totalor at least 5000but certainly 2500 hilarious
