you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a familyless adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine ohara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesnt have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maudes husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drews rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you cant buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene
