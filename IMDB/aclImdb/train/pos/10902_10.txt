i was greatly moved when i watched the moviehow jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing so many people only care about what they want  and fuss about all the things they dont have  and they are such small things like chothesmoney a new car  ive seen people in tears because of a blemish this movie brings everything back to the basics  lovehope the beauty of the simple but so important things in lifeit makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food a roof over your head and your loved ones around you you are truly blessedand the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaningand i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faithstrenghtand humor with me thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above
