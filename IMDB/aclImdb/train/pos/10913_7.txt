william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an exwife in the exmrs bradford also starring jean arthur eric blore and james gleason it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other thin man type movies one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur both to very good effectbr br somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty debonair professional and the exmrs bradford is no exception the exmrs b has mr b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that shes dragged him into and this isnt the first time shes done that it almost seems as though there was a bradford film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films  mr b complains that his mysterywriter ex is constantly bringing him into cases this time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish linebr br the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but its beside the point the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the exmrs b jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny however with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained i suspect the writer had something else in mind  say the wacky side of carole lombard when arthur hears that the police have arrived she says ah its probably about my alimony ive been waiting for the police to take a hand in it its more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her ownbr br definitely worth watching as william powell and jean arthur always were
