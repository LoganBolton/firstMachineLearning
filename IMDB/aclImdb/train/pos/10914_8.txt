ive seen the thin man series  powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthurs chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an offscreen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to schmooze and lock lips with powell there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks powells character lawrence bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too gushy but i cant help myself
