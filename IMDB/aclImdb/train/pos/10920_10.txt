i recall seeing this movie as a kid i dont recall where i saw it i must have been around 14 years old i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again it came on the kung fu channel once but i missed it i was really bummed it is the best specialeffects kung fu movie that ive seen to date i highly recommend it and now that ive discovered where to get it i can enjoy it once more and for years to come i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly
