after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd hence the spin punim a dork the beginning was everything i hoped for a perfect setup along with some quotes that ive heard on various wutang albums to what should have been a good movie but the plot i heard was so great was so predictable every time i saw a character except for the lizard i guessed which venom he was plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie ok so the plot wasnt very good but at least there was some good kungfu right wrong the fights were very short and few and far between granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened in short not much happens the fighting is all pretty routine dont be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot it does not mean its a good one
