this movie is really good the plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are very good theres a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but its only my opinion to watch and its fascinating show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too effeminate at least for me hong kong was always good at kungfu movies especially in the 70s and 80s so five venoms or other its versions is great choice
