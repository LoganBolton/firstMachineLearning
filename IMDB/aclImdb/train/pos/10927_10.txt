this is one of my favourite kungfu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70s the plot is interesting and twisty the characters are cool each with their own style  toad snake lizard etc the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh  venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kungfu styles on display from the various characters i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang chehs films are the same most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts this film is breath of fresh air in comparison
