a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clanhe is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake centipede scorpion lizard toad while the last student was taught a little in each style all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the moneyand soon everyone is battling to get the moneybr br classic martial arts film has title that even many nonfans know ive spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head its a very good movie though im not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example this isnt to sell the film short its not since the film is structured like a mystery our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is were given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think ive ever seen where there are no women i dont think one has a speaking role and im pretty sure that none appear in the background its indicative of nothing its just something that struck me this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couchbr br around 7 out of 10
