be careful with this one once you get yer mitts on it itll change the way you look at kungfu flicks you will be yearning a plot from all of the kungfu films now you will be wanting character depth and development you will be craving mystery and unpredictability you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops sadly you wont find all of these aspects together in one kungfu movie except for five deadly venomsbr br easily the best kungfu movie of alltime venoms blends a rich plot full of twists and turns with colourful and developed characters along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which and who specializes in what venom one is the centipede two is the snake three is the scorpion four is the lizard and five is the toad each character has different traits characteristics strengths and weaknesses therein lies the hook we learn along with the student character finding out who these different men turn out to be we are in his shoes so to speak and we have to pick who we trust and who we dont just like he does we learn along with himbr br not only is the plot the characters and the camerawork great its also fun to watch which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of its kind its worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything thats going on venoms is a lesson on what kungfu can really dojust dont expect many other kungfu films to live up to its gauntlet
