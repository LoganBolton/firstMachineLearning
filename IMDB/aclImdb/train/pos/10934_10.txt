after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism nor any of its eyepopping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his unfinished pupil out to find the 5 past members of his poison clan so they do not seek out a fortune which the masters friend keeps hidden afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training he instructs him to befriend one of the five venoms so as to defeat the other fourbr br i cant say enough about the choreography or the camera work a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made a classic
