most 70s and 80s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few wellplanned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes  like porno films reallybr br but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a style  its really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect worksbr br second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniqueseven by todays measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the futurebr br least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who unfolds the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesnt know who hes seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedynoir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genrebr br the five venoms idea is the template for tarantinos deadly viper assassins from the kill bill volumes
