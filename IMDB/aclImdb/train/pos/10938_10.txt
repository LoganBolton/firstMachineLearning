seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic i happened to see the dubbed version but im on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue still the dubbing didnt get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour poison clan rocks the worldbr br the storytelling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue suspense and interpersonal relationships you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pacebr br the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed its like watching real animals fight each other but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinemabr br the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the films genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution of course if you just want to see people pummel each other along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture be my guest
