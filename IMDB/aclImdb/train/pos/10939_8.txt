the five deadly venoms is a great kungfu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery there are all the usual telltale signs of a kungfu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions however the plot certainly is better than average its interesting and holds your attention throughout the nonfight scenes occasionally its even able to fire up the audience such as when x character receives horrible injusticebr br another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movies morals and themes just about everyone gets whats coming to them the cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out the bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing the good guys use teamwork planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top br br poison clan rocks
