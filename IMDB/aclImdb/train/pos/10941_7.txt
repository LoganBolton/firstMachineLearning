the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy  sarahs character is a true sociopath very comparable to sedaris jerri blankbr br the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sisters character is good funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal sarahs show however the rest of the cast is extremely subpar in comparisonbr br im glad though that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
