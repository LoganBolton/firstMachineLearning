i have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review takes pity on me whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her freakyfunny world but in all seriousness it was good first episode is obviously finding its feet but its got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it its not a laugh out loud sort of comedy but thats good thing too much has a laughtertrack to it and this wouldnt be right with cues when to laugh its to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with its weird characters and incredibly strong central character well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes a very good chance from the usual comedy out there br br ps sarah call me
