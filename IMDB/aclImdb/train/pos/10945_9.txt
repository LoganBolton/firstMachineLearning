best show since seinfeld shes really really funny her total self centeredness the hulking gay stoner neighbors the departures into song or cartoons make this the freshest show on tv one of the few shows i make point of watching the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore oh wait now that youre close you do look old turns face with finger and walks away lol the cough syrup overdose sleeping with god its all so funny or so stupid its just a lot of fun the shows weak points are her sister and the coponly because theyre too darn normal i really cant wait until the next show something i havent felt for any show in a long time
