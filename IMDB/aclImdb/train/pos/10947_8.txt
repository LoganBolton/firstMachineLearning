the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarahs own stand up its so over the top with prejudice that you cant possibly take it to heart the fact is though that while most all people will get it it doesnt mean they will all appreciate it its a very polarizing and one dimensional show so if you dont like it after 10 minutes you may as well give up there if you do like it after 10 minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far has been as good as the lastbr br like all shows though it is not perfect personally i love the program but there are some huge faults with it racist songs are funny but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realizea problem that i had with jesus is magic as well it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesnt need to exist not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good the music well isntbr br another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python upright citizens brigade etc it is nothing like those shows i can watch monty python all day but as much as i like this show i cant watch more than the half hour limit at a time it gets flat very fast the repeat value for this show is low toothe second time around an episode is fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion its boringbr br still that first time around is very very funny give it a shot
