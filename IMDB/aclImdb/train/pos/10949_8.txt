first and foremost i would like to say that im a huge sarah silverman fan and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form maybe not directly funny but the situation and the delivery are what countsbr br if you liked jesus is magic then i dont see how you wouldnt like this it has that same flow and that same rhythm true its only for the true fans but if you are youll be pleasedbr br again only for the true fans theres no way around that if youre not used to her style then you wouldnt get why this is funny however it is and i hope you think so too
