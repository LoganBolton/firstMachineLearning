when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it revolved around sarah like the character sees the worldrevolving around her i got it but wasnt laughing very muchbr br onstage and in her show shes racist crude insensitive and hugely selfcentered i didnt get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie jesus is magic i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me explaining to me just what language shes speaking shes like marilyn manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isnt an assault its a statement and once you understand that you find youre glad someones finally giving it to you straightbr br i dont mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy while i like a lot of smart shows i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm i get the impression that its good but i just dont get it many people will never get the sarah silverman program but im glad i eventually came aroundbr br the creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers these people arent putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together if i was to predict the future of this show id say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks  geeks it will get canceled before its time and live on in fans hearts and on dvd but take heart ssp creators your audience is out there and well be watching for as long as they let you make the show
