big s isnt playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like say mencia or chapelle though i like them both she states the obvious in subtle near subliminal remarks her show wont change the world nor is it meant to but along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewsters exboyfriend jay johnston of mr show fame this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction my sides were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode look i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend jimmy kimmel she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run withit the best kind of comedy around spoofing anything and anyone like mary poppins in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense this one is highly recommended but only for those who still have a funny bone and didnt lose it in their most recent lipposuction treatment or boob job
