sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch shes beautiful sexy funny and talent dark and demonic i read the other comment on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just dont get it nothing that appears on tv is an accident too much money time and work is put into the production of a tv show for there to be mistakes this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre its a lot like peewees playhouse for maladjusted slacker twentysomething glue sniffing future pornstars of america from the valley the cast is awesome the scenarios and action is wellpaced i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didnt let david spade keep his show who plays sarahs sister she not in the cast listing on the shows home page i would love to see her standup does anyone know about her upcoming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there
