this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldnt stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight despite the fact that ive seen all the episodes previously ive always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time i cant say that about many tv shows can you this show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this series and just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just dont get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they dont understand anyone who uses the word bigot in reference to silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark shes exactly the opposite just google her and youll quickly see that shes a huge proponent of civil rights etc if you dont know that shes ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints you dont get it and if you dont get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity
