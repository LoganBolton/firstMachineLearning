i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedys sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women id say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating ie are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though
