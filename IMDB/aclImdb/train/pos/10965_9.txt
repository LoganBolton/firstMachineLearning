little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version big edie says to little edie if youre stuck its only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie wasnt so hard on herself the first time things didnt work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she didnt listen to her moms plea come home edie let me take care of youbr br yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay br br great documentarybr br 910
