grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldnt really look away it was so strange and funny and sad and sick and  really no words can describe the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre i found out about this film reading my uncle johns great big bathroom reader by the bathroom readers institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue this movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits which i am sure include curtains when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie thumbing my nose at normalcy and society
