trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadnt yet seen renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse my son is so jaded with current b science fiction that he hasnt bothered seeing this yetbr br it must be noted i didnt see anything about cypher when it was released in australia it must have been very quiet or i just missed itbr br well this was a really pleasant surprise this is also no b movie its not a blockbuster of the epic variety and doesnt try to be  more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for its plot to be fully savouredbr br the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used  my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view but they get it right at its 2nd appearance  that aside everything else is top notch in any case the affects are secondarybr br i wont give anything away about the plot the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct though with very different contentbr br just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke the actor was born in cambridge england and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect its a tad off key see the final twist of the plot and youll see why that is such a brilliant choice and lucy liu is also just right with her will she kiss me  will she shoot me edgebr br i rarely watch movies several times within days  this is one of them
