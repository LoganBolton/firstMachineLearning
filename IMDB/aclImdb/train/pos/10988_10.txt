dont read anything about this movie especially nothing that could contain any spoilers just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it  and youll have a really great experience if you like to see an intelligent twisted story go get the dvd and youll truly not be disappointed cypher is not really a scifi movie more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business its about corporate secrets how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness cypher is much deeper more complex and  what belongs the story and the ending  also much much more satisfying than vincenzo natalis other movies cube and nothing actually its one of the best movies ive ever seen and thats something i really dont say this about every fifth wellmade flick sorry cant tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience just give it a chance
