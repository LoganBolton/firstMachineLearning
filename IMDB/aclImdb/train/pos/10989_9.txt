cypher is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future while thematically not complex this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty ruthlessness and corporate conspiracy to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalfbr br the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man morgan sullivan jeremy northam who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative after an initial briefing with digicorps security chief sullivan is then given a new identity jack thursby and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies upon successfully completing his first assignment sullivanthursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered however on one of his business trips he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster liu whom he had met on his previous assignment and from there things go extremely topsyturvy the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorps espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorps main competitors thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companiesbr br spoilers end herebr br what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes vivid lighting was used in mainly domestichousehold settings while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and coverup i was also very impressed with jeremy northam not too often have i seen him in the lead role and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant personally i think hes one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasnt been given more challenging roles lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloakanddagger tone additionally the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job however my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated for example i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second wife overall this is a cleverly developed cloakanddagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future im surprised that i had never watched this hidden gem before this is a brilliant nottoooverly complicated spy thriller and therefore im giving it a 9 out of 10
