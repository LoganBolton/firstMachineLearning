cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it it has its obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noirdetective feel than anything else which really adds to the storybr br the film overall plays out like its some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere were never sure of what exactly is going on were never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and were not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i havent seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar terry gilliams brazil going with the eeriness stated earlier cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that theres something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements wellbr br there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually arent people who say theyre helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look despite a lot of switching things around twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if theyre not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy lius character  and shes trying to help out the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents the whole thing plays out like some sort of minicold war something that resembles the usa and the ussr in their war of words heyday and it really pulls through given the black bleak often cgi littered screen that i was glued to br br what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and fosters own motivation this sequence disappears because hes breaking away from the computerised repetitive controlled life that hes being told to live and is branching outbr br cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film to say it resembles the first jason bourne film only set in the scifi genre isnt cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year like i mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film
