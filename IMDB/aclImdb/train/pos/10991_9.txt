cypher is a movie well worth seeing because its not the runofthemill scifi flick the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of whats going on the closeup camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive the scifi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie the technology used in the movie isnt overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props br br the character development is intentionally shallow the main character jeremy northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage its up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and its the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end
