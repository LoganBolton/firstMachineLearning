damn ive seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still dont get bored watching itbr br the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mindblowing to mebr br the cgis are quite bad imho but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just just a genius perfect combination for such a movie the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable the plot is so goodbr br however although the movie had little flaws like eg sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too slow but i dont mean the scenic parts by that i totally loved thosebr br also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story like when he is in the underground bunkerlike thing of digicorps where all their data is saved and has this conversation with the guy down there but that may also just be me d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized they should have made the gettingbacktruememorypart a bit longer and louder but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again
