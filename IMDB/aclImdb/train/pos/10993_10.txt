this movie is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolutionbr br i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace its not about explosions car chases or flying bullets you must be patient and instead note the details here its sedate because thats what the main character is the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfoldsbr br i will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching the plot is what youve read from the other postings an average whitecollar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data br br take it from therebr br this movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoiabr br then it begins to acceleratebr br the acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters but they all fit and they entertain and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginningbr br and at the end all is not what it seemsbr br get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen
