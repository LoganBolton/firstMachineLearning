this is my first comment this is a fantastic movie i watched it all by luck one night on tv at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this wasbr br i suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad b movie how wrong superficial critiquesbr br i think that the movie is almost a product of genius the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time
