ive seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell its one the best movies ive ever seen in my life  br br what you need to know is that you dont have to miss any minute of this movie if you dont completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end br br the end is what makes this movie so good you cant expect itbr br congratulations to the producer
