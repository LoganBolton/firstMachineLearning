who can watch a movie look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed that woman is amazingly beautiful  a talented actress thats a tough combination to find now a days and jeremy northam i heard his name plenty of times but i never really noticed him my advice to hollywood is  use him morebr br now about the movie i watched it in one of my graveyard shift i dont recommend that to anyone its a bit to complicated  mysterious for that i still cant believe i didnt see the ending coming im not gonna say what cause thatll spoil the hole movie although saying this is spoilment enoughbr br now im suppose to cast my vote about this movie i love the dark mystic story the actors did a good job  i love the directors natali work in the past theres not a big audience for this kind of thing thats also pretty risky you know what im just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this then again 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement
