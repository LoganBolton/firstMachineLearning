its actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond as im sure he wouldnt be able to keep up in the nowadays spyingbusiness where fast cars have been replaced with hitech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment cypher is a pretty inventive scifi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright  claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible you know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again the events in cypher supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world where the major companies dont really do a lot apart from trying to steal each others thunder company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor the sunways corporation sunways on the other hand constantly tries to unmask the digisoftrats and recruit them again as doublespies in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan a seemingly colorless thirtysomething employee whos been selected by sebastian rooks the überspy to diddle the secret policies of both companies trust me its actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali the dude from tube carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem seconds  starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60s film with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless theres also plenty of great action and suspense most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashingtechniques during boring conventions the middle section of the film drags a little mainly because you already realize that its all just building up towards multiple misleading plottwists and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the notsodistant future jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side regular directors choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c dunn cypher is well made and adrenalin rushing scifi entertainment highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time
