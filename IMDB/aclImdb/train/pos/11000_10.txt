if you came into the film with expectations throw them away now because no amount of hype will do this film justicebr br to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal its a spy thriller has elements of noir bits and pieces of action science fiction and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative mindbending plot twists and gorgeous cinematographybr br a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative both in good and bad ways of other movies but as they say every story cribs from shakespeare so once you can get past that youre in for a hell of a ridebr br you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points and while the set never becomes unbelievable there are portions read the elevator which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals dont misconstrue that to mean its on the same level as cheesy scifi channel movies though because this is on a much higher levelbr br if youre looking for action you should turn away this is pure psychology but if youre willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience by all means do it now watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it
