youll notice by the stars ive given this great film that before you see it the first time is implied i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in im not sure how this movie slipped past me i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too still it didbr br this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you dont have a large budget it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough the entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns i would have given this film 1010 however some of the shots were pretty fake looking i dont hold that against this film too much but i dont think it deserves a perfect scorebr br lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious as always i think shes pretty underrated as a serious talent nevermind her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesnt rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as wellbr br jeremy northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any maze to prove himself however as he changes throughout the film its like night and day i know some fans of clive owen jude law or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this but northam wouldcouldshould fit that bill hes suave and cultured hes got a great bond posture and voice i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather downtoearth as wellbr br great film and definitely this moviebuff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films
