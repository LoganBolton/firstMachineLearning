 having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city jim blandings cary grant finds a property in the country for his wife and children hes hoping to find the simple life but building a house proves to be anything but simple as the headaches and the bills start piling up so do the laughs will mr blandings ever get his dream house br br  what makes this movie so special is the three main actors  grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own so when you combine their talents almost every scene is special grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role he is so good at playing the put upon husband loy is a always a joy to watch the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years douglas also appeared in the old dark house a particular favorite of minebr br  the movie is definitely a product of its time i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a twostory three bedroom four bathroom house on 15000 income a year throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a livein maid and it becomes almost fancifulbr br  however for anyone who has bought or built a house many of the situations and predicaments the blandings find themselves in are easily relatable to today and thats where the comedy comes in how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected  the biggest complaint i have about mr blandings is the whole wife in love with best friend subplot its really not necessary to the plot and feels outofplace and very uncomfortable as presented
