when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration that didnt really happen surprisingly and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discreditbr br the story is of a morgan sullivan who applies for a job with a highflying technocompany called digicorp his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company while under an assumed and false identity his homelife is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what hes actually doing however things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows whats going on he starts to question who he actually is this is not helped by a strange woman who turns upbr br twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievablebr br its an enthralling journey through a nottoodistant future and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seatbr br highly recommended
