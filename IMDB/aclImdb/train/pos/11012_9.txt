i wasnt sure at first if i was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all threebr br admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipmentbr br where this movie came together for me was closer to the end the scenes had a realism at least as i perceived it that i havent encountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarcebr br the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years
