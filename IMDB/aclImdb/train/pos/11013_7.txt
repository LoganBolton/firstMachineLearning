there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public seen today some might dismiss them or just see them as propagandawhich they technically are but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genrehaving a pretty realistic script and good production values pat obrien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films you know the toughtalking harddriven but swell guy randolph scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews the film is wellcrafted enough to make it interesting and not too farfetched that it perhaps except for the very endwhere the film is a bit overthetop but also very satisfying about the only serious negative and this is mostly for nitpickers is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and nuts like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice thisall others probably wont notice
