while the prices have gone up a lot and some of the details have become dated any homeowner whos struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie i know i didbr br mr blandings a new york ad executive decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there he gets into one hilarious jam after another from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water they dig down hundreds of feet but never find water yet only a short distance away a few days later the basement of his housetobe floodsbr br cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the harried blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined and melvyn douglas is even better as blandings lawyer and family friendbr br the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 mrs blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble shes causing and theres a black maid horrors so dont watch this movie through the social lens of 2003 and youll enjoy it all the morebr br
