this movie is just great its entertaining from beginning to the end youre always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the criticsbr br sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountainrescue guy gabe walker together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker and then john lithgow one of the best performances ive seen of him as a villainbr br and the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action br br brilliant movie
