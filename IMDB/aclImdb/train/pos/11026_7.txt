was this based on a comicbook a videogame a drawing by a 3 yearold br br there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the dialog not the plot not the action nothing we have hightech international terroristscriminals who bicker like preschool kids stallones manofsteeltype resilience towards icecold weather dialog so dumb that its sometimes almost hilarious and so on even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb tangotango a film that entertains through some suspense good actionsequences and a nice snowy mountainous setting oh yes and the unintentional humourbr br the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our golucky and happy characters who are obviously having a swell time then comes a sweatinducing failedrescue part which should make anyone with fearofheights problems want to pull their hair out and then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell br br stallones melodramatic exchange with turner when they meet after a long time is so soapy so clich√©d so fake and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any selfrespecting viewer soon after this display of awful dialogwriting we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane the entire action is one big absurdity but its mindless fun at its best although the rest of the action is exciting and fun the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film after the landing our mastercriminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker they send stallone to fetch the first case of money but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off so he can freeze and they wont give him the equipment he needs so he can fall off do these gangsters want their money fetched or not very silly apparently they dont trust stallone but surely they know that they can always blackmail him by using rooker as a hostage nevertheless our gangsters make stallones climb difficult if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are  lest there be any doubts and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are they overact brag and snicker in a truly evil manner everyone convinced good youd better be otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystalclear to everyonebr br the old guy who flies the chopper how the hell did he fall for the trap firstly he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals and secondly he must have heard stallones and rookers voices on the walkietalkies a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines get off my back lithgow i havent even started climbing on your back or lithgow to stallone we had a deal but now we only have each other and as for lithgows gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately they are very creative about it they philosophize pretend that they are playing football with your body and so on br br stallone cowrote this thing i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it id hate to think the script is this bad because of a low iq
