since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite since then ive seen it countless times and i never get tired of it the setting has a lot to do with it the colorado i know would be jealous but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes there has not been a movie i can compare this too john lithgow plays a smart villain but i love how he is completely out of his elementhe has to follow tucker around and thats what keeps it interesting this is an action movie at its best i dont think ill see another that is so entertainingbr br you dont need 50000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie it just has to keep you captivated not shellshocked
