now this is what id call a good horror with occultsupernatural undertones this nice lowbudget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene this proves you dont need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror moviebr br the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmatesbr br i wont say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen there a few flaws though the fx are not that good but theyre used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but malefique redeems itself by the time its overbr br i thought his was a very good movie 810
