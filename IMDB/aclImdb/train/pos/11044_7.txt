good horror movies from france are quite rare and its fairly easy to see why whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film he emigrates towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the bigbudgeted remake of another great film classic how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigydirectors leave the country after just one film haute tension was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre aja a oneway ticket to the states to remake the hills have eyes which he did terrifically i may add eric valettes longfeature debut maléfique was a very promising and engaging horror picture too and hes already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miikes ghoststory hit one missed call so there you have it two very gifted frenchmen that arent likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon maléfique is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start but once the plot properly develops it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters were inside a ramshackle french prison cell with four occupants the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud the elderly and wise inmate sadistically killed his wife and then theres a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome they find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920s who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book only to realize the occult is something you shouldnt mess with eric valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of wishmasterdevice maléfique is a dark film with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals
