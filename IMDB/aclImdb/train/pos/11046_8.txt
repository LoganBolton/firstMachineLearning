maléfique is a very interesting movie it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures the central concept is great three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth who the audience identify with and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cellbr br the atmosphere is wellwoven it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes in the château dif prior to becoming the count of monte cristo the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell particularly the character we are meant to identify with carrère  a whitecollar criminal whose crime is not specified but its obliquely suggested might be fraud on one occasion carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell the claustrophobia is unbroken there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall so even though the film appears to be very modern it has a very old world feel of incarcerationbr br the characters are intriguing we have marcus a violent preop transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pâquerette french for daisy a heavily retarded young man pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and unfortunately this included his baby sister hence his current predicament i like this comment on internalisation very primitive lasalle is a withdrawn possessed elderly man in for brutally murdering his wifebr br the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you and theres a ritual that goes with that i think thats what disturbs me the most seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically it has a real life ring to it the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong im actually hearing the gong now every time i do something selfdestructivebr br i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters dont really reinforce the message consistently particularly with carrère also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film not in terms of a successive revelation either i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish more by design than execution such as the famous vagina eye and the sodomy of lasalle for me totally hollow imagesbr br at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with and some things dont seem logical for example weve been clumsily led to believe different things about carrères child this doesnt change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird a pure horror movie there is no comedic dross or genre segueing like cube 1997natali the obvious movie to compare it to its a total immersion experience where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters this last comment i make about it being a pure experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous pointbr br on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge this prompts lasalle to go insane that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge its something i myself have feltbr br one final comment is that two of the quite wellreceived comments on the board have confused the characters names to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character simply click on philippe laudenbachs page and you will see he was born in 1936
