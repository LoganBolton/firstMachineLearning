maléfique is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a wellexecuted plot and a lot of heart its cast doesnt have recognized names it doesnt have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and wellwritten script an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills eric valette may not be a wellknow name yet but with maléfique his feature length debut he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet gans or ajabr br the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out carrère gérald laroche gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multimillionaire fraud his cellmates the violent marcus clovis cornillac the intellectual lassalle philippe laudenbach and the mentally challenged pâquerette dimitri rataud are all convicted for murder and give carrère a cold welcome their personalities will clash as carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magicbr br written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier maléfique is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barkers stories the movies strongest point is the way it builds up the characters they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities the storys supernatural element is very wellhandled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel despite being a movie about four men locked in a room the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust claustrophobia and specially paranoiabr br director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere mood and his cast to give life to the plot despite its obvious lack of budget he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original fresh and very attractive his subtle and effective camerawork helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot the very few displays of special effects are very welldone and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gorebr br the characters are what make this film work and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit gérald laroche is excellent as carrère a man at first sight innocent but who hides a dark past philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too specially rataud in his very demanding role however is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of thembr br the movie is terrific but it is not without its share of flaws of course the most notorious one is its the lowbudget some of the cgieffects are a bit poor compared to the effective makeup and prosthetics used in other scenes however it is never too bad for it probably the bad thing about maléfique is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of viewbr br anyways maléfique is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately and one that deserves to have more recognition valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest albeit complex tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities personally this film is a new favorite 810
