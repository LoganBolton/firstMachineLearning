the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shellys ill take you there is not overt but clearly has ties to his work shelly has acted in two of hartleys films not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyperstylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light though this film is not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies ill see you there is a great indiefilm that doesnt stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotionbr br the film begins with bills life falling to pieces not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat all washed up bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy played by the director adrienne shelly brings him all kinds of surprises a selfhelp book and a date for her traumatized brotherbr br the unwilling bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice no doubt bernices initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her however her pseudohippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedybr br aware that bill desperately wants to see rose bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun a pinkerton detective no less an imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with a few stops along the way
