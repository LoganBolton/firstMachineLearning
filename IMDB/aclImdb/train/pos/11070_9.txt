i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 52br br not only does guy bring together a b listish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imaginationbr br far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plateyet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictablebr br this film is special get it now
