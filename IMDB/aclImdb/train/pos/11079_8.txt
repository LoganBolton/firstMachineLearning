i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and dont just dripfeed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesnt compare to other mindmucks like the usual suspects or memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thoughtprovoking film br br another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it youll know what i meanbr br so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well noone ever said revolver is for everyone and thats my 2 cents
