first of all when people hear guy ritchie they immediately think of snatch yes snatch was a good movie but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch they dont expect him to explore new frontiers this movie revolver is different than snatch its much darker and is very complex the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because ive had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything so this movie toys with your head its very cleverly writtenbr br this movie is different than snatch it was done wonderfully the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize guy ritchies personal touch style of directing in itbr br what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers
