ok this movie so far has been slated by critics and boardposters alike although playing devils advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didnt make it for themselves as filmmakers and board posters are often people who didnt make it for themselves as critics so i wanted to sit in guys corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people whove decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at itbr br the films biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is this has been described many times as as making the film inaccessible to the viewer the films chronology is relatively nonlinear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle or not so subtle hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory ie ray liottas character brandishing a gun saying the words fear me is portrayed as both tragically pathetic from stathams pov or interrogating and bold from liottas pov this is but one example of ritchies far more mature approach he has taken to filmmaking with revolver we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal the strong but silent gritty antihero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption i mean its paint by numbers film noir here guys all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voiceovers but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex pointsbr br take the scene where jason stathams character runs afoul of a car this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and deathbr br so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling id be taking the pss if i said i didnt spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going uh wtf but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand and even easier to say well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film in my humble opinion revolver is a stylish complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers if we choose this opportunity to collectively say ah sht i wanted a film about a load of bleeding cockney gangsters innit loll guy ritchie is a tit then the day will come when filmmakers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow crappy people just because guy made a name for himself with funny cheeky cockney romps doesnt mean he cant be deep without being pretentious funny people can be thoughtful too
