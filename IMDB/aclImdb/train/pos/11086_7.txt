i saw this movie when i was little  it was called glacier fox i was totally traumatized by it it follows a cute little fox family around the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics i wont tell you what happened but lets just say it doesnt end well for all of the foxes i was used to disney type nature films where the animals dont really die oh man this movie made me cry for hours it was a good moviei think  i was really little and truth be told all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die rent it if you can but dont show your kids
