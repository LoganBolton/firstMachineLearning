some of the acknowledged altman masterpieces seem sadder to me now maybe its me like the last reviewer i even like this lesser altman shown recently on fmc although i dont think he was aiming at a wide audience organization politics as a microcosm for public campaigns some of this satirical docudrama is now dated like dick cavett watching the tonight show but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful eg you are for real that means youre no threat to anyone the story isnt profound but i liked it and the performances are funny especially cavett as himself lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead glenda jackson who actually became a member of parliament as a left wing ideologue in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics and carol burnett as a basket case all in the inimitable altman style although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual but pretty inimitable
