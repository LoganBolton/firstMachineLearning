lifes going not to badly for harry mitchell hes an exair force major plus nifty little pension i imagine whos raking in the cash for a patent hes developed fusing titanium and steel via explosive process creating super metal fit for nasa and his wife of twentyodd years has kept herself in pretty good nick hes got a nice little pad in la i like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver jag a series 1 etype roadster for him and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her as well as im sure other trinkets and boys toys theres always got to be more though hasnt there so harry lets himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans youre only as old as the woman youre feeling as in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise blotchless life leads to a downwards arc for harrybr br three blackmailers leech onto him these are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles bobby shy played by clarence williams iii is a black excon who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish doublecrossers hes reminiscent of pluto the vicious black excon psychopath from carl franklins wellregarded neonoir one false move 1992 theres a similar character motivation i believe both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in extremis robert trebor plays leo franks a fat lilylivered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at 25 for half an hour and 50 for a whole hour did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount hes in over his head and its great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown john glover wins as alan raimy who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui hes a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what i believe is a pretty wellimplied rape pay attention to his rap sheet readout its easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with slimbr br in common with one false move though not exclusively i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violencebr br so far so good but i think theres a real problem with the film harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his tit in the wringer my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider roy scheider protagonists never lose theyre selfsure and smooth but not in an annoying way i feel im being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however i didnt believe it for me its like being asked to believe that sandra bullocks character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or stephen seagals character is going to get taken down by the baddies did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value roy scheider doesnt convince as an adulterer either you dont feel any annoyance with him at all his character is tefloncoatedbr br it also felt like a movie that took some cuts at 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped harrys wife ann margaret is pretty much a cardboard cutout an extension of harry her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention the effect that the affair has on harrys marriage isnt properly communicated this could be a frankenheimer problem hes not known for character development i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs br br there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better no disrespect to the great roy scheider the film felt short even with the long running time and i think could have taken some more fleshing outbr br but you really cant forget the sleaze like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour
