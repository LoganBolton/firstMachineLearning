this slick and gritty film consistently delivers its one of frankenheimers best and most underrated films and its easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date and if you are scratching your head thinking but i loved get shorty you need to be punched in the face in my opinion no one captures the feel for leonards characters better then john glover in 52 pickup the relocation of the story from detroit novel to hollywood film elevates the storys sleaze factor to amazing heights be a man have a few beers and watch this movie for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag rum punch cat chaser city primeval and 52 pickup my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate i also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for dead bang and black sunday
