ive always liked this john frankenheimer film good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasnt just another thriller is because of frankenheimer his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made ive always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and hes excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped a guilty pleasure to say the least vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance a classic exploitive thriller that shouldnt be forgotten
