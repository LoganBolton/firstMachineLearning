based on elmore leonard this is a violent and intelligent action film the story a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credits got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting  something that is very rare for an action film also features some beautiful and sexy women  most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieders character vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers im glad to say that annmargaret still hasnt lost it  this lady is a true babe dont look at the rate of this film i really dont know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and underrated film you will enjoy it thats a promise recommended a
