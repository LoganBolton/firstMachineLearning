chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rocksolid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show everbr br all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmys anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him  mesmerized by himbr br many people that ive spoken to about the sopranos who havent seen it yet will say im just not a fan of mafia moviesshows whatever run  dont walk  and get it those same people usually love er but i bet they dont much care for hospitals its not about the context
