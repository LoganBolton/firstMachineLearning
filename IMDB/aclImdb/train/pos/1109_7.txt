having only seen two of his pictures previously ive come to terms with altman before though i always labeled his style of filmmaking boring you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy geniusbr br health is fairly underrated and very questionably out of print in fact i dont think its ever even been issued to vhs why is that when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily this one is left behind for no good reason honestly i had no real problems with this film it was for the most part consistently amusing and funny almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances there is real skill herebr br and paul dooleys stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinatingbr br if you can try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem its not perfect but its much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases hell id be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thingbr br its often on the fox movie channel though so look out for it
