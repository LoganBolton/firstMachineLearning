i cant add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here  great acting balanced writing multifaceted characters a great antihero in tony great commentary on millennial american life the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous several other characters add a lot of depth  heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in ralphies total irredeemable viciousness chris dual desires in life and so onbr br i have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the it glorifies violencebelittles italianamericans onemost of the writers and actors are italianamerican would they attack themselves there are several positive italianamerican characters  artie bucco the chef dr melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos indeed dr melfis exhusband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of italianamericans have ever had mob connections certainly smaller than the proportion of africanamericans involved in crime dare i say it in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causesbr br most of the characters dont really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it outsiders even of italian stock who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends  matthew and his friend in season 2 for example if you criticise this show i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or will  grace made you want to go homosexual presumably you wont listen to rap music that discusses gangs or rnb which discusses promiscuity or rock music which discusses drugs or any other combination people arent as stupid as some of you make outbr br not everything is perfect however a lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes  tracee the dancer meadows friend ally uncle juniors ladyfriend supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1
