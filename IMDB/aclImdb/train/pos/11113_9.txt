ive only watched the first series on dvd but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantinolike script the series is as good as goodfellas and casino and almost as good as the godfather hence not a 10 and far better than any of guy ritchies efforts although theres plenty of action some of it pretty bloody the story is character driven even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines eg the priests relationship or lack of with carmilla and the restaurateurs wife and christopher and his dimwit friend who didnt last very long a darwin award nomineebr br apart from the plot the script and the acting the other reasons i liked itbr br 1 it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce 2 the music 3 it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
