not only do the storylines in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james gandolfini who plays the leadman tony soprano has become in this viewers opinion one of the hollywood elites as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldnt go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since 1999 gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and its not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco edie falco michael imperioli dominic chianese and the late nancy marchand who played tonys dreadful mother at this point in the shows existence its being considered a cultclassic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didnt quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 season 4 which wrapped up right before newyears was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dryspell i still found it season 4 of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and thats saying a lot because lately ive been noticing a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close id like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer 17 and above who enjoys drama and doesnt mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time
