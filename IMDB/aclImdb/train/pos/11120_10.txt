wow i loved the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4  5 while remaining better than anything else on television but 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons br br 6b started with such a sombre mood and janices always keen insight into the family angst  that doomfilled line about knowing tonys penchant for sitting and staring anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony melfis discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopaths selfdeluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with tonys panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phils wave byebye line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into chases dark humourbr br i could go on and on but ill just add that i thought the final show  starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow you keep me hangin on to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like ajs suv or phils head were utterly utterly perfect the best tv ever br br pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the jackoff fantasies aj derides and then into which he promptly subsides a tip of the pork pie to mr chase
