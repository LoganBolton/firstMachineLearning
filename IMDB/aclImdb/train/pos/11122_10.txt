when we started watching this series on cable i had no idea how addictive it would be even when you hate a character you hold back because they are so beautifully developed you can almost understand why they react to frustration fear greed or temptation the way they do its almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of christophers learning curvesbr br i cant understand why adriana would put up with christophers abuse of her verbally physically and emotionally but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior carmella has a dream house endless supply of expensive things but im sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband  or maybe not thats why i watchbr br it doesnt matter how many times you watch an episode you can find something you missed the first five times we even watch episodes out of sequence watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language ae with language censored reruns on the movie network  whenever theyre on were there weve been totally spoiled nowbr br i also love the malaprops an albacore around my neck is my favorite of johnny boy when these jewels have entered our family vocabulary it is a sign that i should get a life i will when the series ends and i have collected all the dvds and put the collection in my will
