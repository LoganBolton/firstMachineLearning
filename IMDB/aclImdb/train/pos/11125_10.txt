what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude the sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it it has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting watching this show youll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano or any character this show is also very versatile some people dont watch the show because its violent its not all about the violence its about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see for me i dont like when people refer to the show a show about the mafia for me its a show about family a family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together a show that defines excellence and dares to be different
