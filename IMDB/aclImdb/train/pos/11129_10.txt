i didnt at all think of it this way but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title midnight cowboy was a gay porno at that point all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that seinfeld episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramers all sick and with a nosebleedbr br the movie was great and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i cant even remember because theyre all crapbr br the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler a male prostitute basically thinking itll be easy pickings only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him charging him for their sexual encounterbr br then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo called ratso by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time you think of him as a scoundrel but a lovable one like han solo or lando calrissian and surprisingly he and joe become friends and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad pitiable man whos very sick and very depressed and selfconscious hates being called ratso and wants to go to florida where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved and hell learn to be a cook and be famous therebr br its heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida along with many hilarious moments like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party and getting caught by the woman who says gee well you know its free you dont have to steal it and he says well if its free then i aint stealin it and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi and screams hey im walkin here im walkin here and the acting is so believable youd never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman its not the first time theyve worked together in lead roles but the chemistry is so thick and intensebr br then theres the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it depressing ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie can barely walk barely eat coughs a lot is sick and reaches a headpoint on the bus on its way to florida hes hurting badly and only miles away from miami he finally dies on the bus the bus driver reassures everyone that nothings wrong and continues on sad but not in the kind of way thatd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though youve just lost your dog of 13 yearsbr br all in all great movie and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of everybodys talking played all throughout the movie at appropriate times an odd move but a great one as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly go see it its great go buy it
