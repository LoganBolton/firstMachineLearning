although i love this movie i can barely watch it it is so real so i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers i remembered it vividly but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadnt seen beforei didnt thats because its so real to mebr br another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary im all for that  its absolutely obvious that most of these people whove made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time ill be just as ruinously frank i am 82yearsold if youre familiar with some of my other comments youll be aware that i was a professional femaleimpersonator for 60 of those years and also have appeared in film  youd never recognize me even if you were familiar with my nightclub persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film  you bet i do br br and am not the least bit ashamed if you havent runinto some of them its your loss  but theres a huge chance you have but just didnt know it so many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actorsactresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge  i can name several current bigtime stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and werent the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are  love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks likebr br the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem  he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles  how do you think he gets his input i can also name lots of malestars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was worldfamous and legit i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our backstreet looking to make a pickupbr br this should be no surprise today although its definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wakeup and smell the roses they smell no less sweet because they are of a different huebr br some of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didnt find any incidence of that believeitornot kids havent always had their own rooms  because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be goingon in the masterbedroom whose business hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users pointout that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy  his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed  no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hipbr br i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe  they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship  true friendship if you didnt understand that at the end of the movie then youve wasted your time joes bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role  one that john wayne could never pulloff and he was as handsome in his youthbr br hoffman is hoffman  you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined  if you dont think they are still around you are mistaken the party   attend some of the raves younger people attendif you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs  youll see every outrageous personalitybr br brenda viccaro was the epitome of societys sleek women who have to get down to the nittygritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isnt real look at todays ladies who live on the brink of disreputeand are admired for itbr br the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you dont have to condone it but its not too much different than any violence joe pointedly named his purpose  in that situation id have handedover the money quicker than he asked for it thats one of the scenes that makes this movie a breakthrough one which i do not watch i get heartbroken for bothbr br john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eyeopener waldo salt didnt write from clairvoyance anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other moviemakers make no compunction in presenting it to the public not looking doesnt mean it isnt there  give me the truth every time bravo to all
