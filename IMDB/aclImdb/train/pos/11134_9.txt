acidic unremitting and beautiful john schlesingers masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago when american life was even more disorienting the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s final dissolution of the great american west the intensification of war in vietnam and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in varietybr br midnight cowboy is widely known as the only academy awardwinning film to garner an x rating but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art while this film from the novel by james leo herlihy has much to say about the erosion of american life it transcends 60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras the two main characters in fact are standard antiheroes  men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our worldbr br the initial focus of midnight cowboy is on 28yearold joe buck a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight in the opening scenes we follow joes bus trip to new york city where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents  the ability to pleasure women  and earn his fortune as a hustler we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as one hell of a stud the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx ratso who is short thin and with a limp proves of little monetary help to joe they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous oddsbr br throughout the film joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas including life with his grandmother sally ruth white who served as guardian his harried relationship with crazy annie jennifer salt a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair very much of its time midnight cowboy strings together a wild array of flashbacks dream sequences and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso more questions about their lives are generated both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive this revelation pushes midnight cowboy to its conclusion a rather hopeful one in a very grim storybr br while joe and ratso badly need some luck the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salts screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast which features sylvia miles brenda vaccaro and members of the andy warhol clique offers itself as an essential part of the storyline the flashback sequences involving voight ruth white and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lostbr br any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender the boy who could fly smoke and editing by hugh robertson shaft the visuals of midnight cowboy work with its soundtrack assembled by john barry as a cohesive unit sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades the lead song everybodys talking is sung by nilsson which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean toots thielemansbr br midnight cowboy has been released in a twodisc collectors edition by mgmua which contains expanded features and commentary also available is a 1998 dvd release used for this review which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 51 dolby digital sound enhancement threelanguage subtitles and closed captioning french dubbing a theatrical rerelease trailer not the original as advertised and an eightpage production booklet both dvd editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film showing its original brilliance welldeserving of its three oscars best picture schlesinger waldo salt and additional nominations voight hoffman sylvia miles hugh robertson midnight cowboy will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classicsbr br  ½ out of 4
