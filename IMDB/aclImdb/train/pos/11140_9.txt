john schlesingers midnight cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only xrated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didnt really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didnt consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybodys talking at me i dont hear a word theyre sayin make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever releasedbr br young joe buck thennewcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new yorkbr br joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as naïve as joe ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbecks classic novel of mice and menbr br shot largely on the streets of new york midnight cowboy is a grittilyrealistic look at life in the slums watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside ratsos squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultrarealism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role im walkin here im walkin here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his muchlauded debut in 1967s the graduate both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was sylvia miles for an appearance that cant have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in true grit midnight cowboy eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo saltbr br midnight cowboy is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joes past rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the achinglybeautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty gritty thoughtprovoking and intensely fascinating midnight cowboy is one for the ages
