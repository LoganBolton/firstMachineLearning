midnight cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know its a classic the moment its insistent theme song everybodys talking starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck naked and in the shower we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us hes one helluva stud whos to doubt him this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish anaconda is a source of pleasurebr br the film became famous and infamous almost overnight it was a crowdpleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably real it was the tailend of the sixties and all the characters rang true it was also the first x rated film to win the oscar as the years best picture adapted brilliantly by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first mainstream commercial american movie to deal with taboo subjects such as homosexuality and drugtaking in a matteroffact manner everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically voights joe buck is an innocent abroad a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy hes a cross between a gigolo and a social worker but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little conman called ratso rizzo dustin hoffman fresh from the graduate and hes a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipedreambr br essentially its a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other voight with his physical prowess hoffman with his streetwise savvy they are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others though straight voight isnt beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself the whole film posits a strangely christian attitudebr br its also magnificently acted while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangerson beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesingers direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an aliens totally detached eyeview of the american underbelly without rancor and without criticism on second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all
