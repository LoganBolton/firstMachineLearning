just kiddingbr br seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city jon voight is young optimist cowboy almost forest gumplike joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its streetthugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survivebr br while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippievibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warholparty cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultraurban new york city the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his outofplace position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzobr br midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its purehearted and outofplace lead character and to an extent the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour  a contrast between countrycowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommendbr br 8510
