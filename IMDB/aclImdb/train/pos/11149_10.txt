joe buck jon voight decides hes going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tuttifruttis wideeyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homelesslooking man who lives in an apparently condemned buildingbr br there isnt much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe bucks plights in the city but also intercut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semipsychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gangraped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybodys talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he wont and will end up working for pennies in a deadend job  shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like thisbr br a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers  ratsos reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this  but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser
