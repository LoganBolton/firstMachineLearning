at the time i recall being quite startled and amused by this movie i referred to it as the most important movie id seen in ten years and found myself bumping into people who said similar things br br bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had into a corrosive adult worldview the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers hi skip i wish you werent my brother so i could  you br br bernhards search for herself after returning to la from new york results in the immersive tryingon of various personas all of which fit poorly for our amusement but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a black imperative values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her its been a while nina simone comes to mind and she has an impressive solidlybuilt black lover in the movie a pretty black girl attends the shows and seems to be authorizing sandras fauxblackness but ultimately rejects herbr br just as catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for christ here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection its the only value system implicated in the films world outside of bernhards arty confusionbr br for a nation whose chief issues are racism and money its refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way
