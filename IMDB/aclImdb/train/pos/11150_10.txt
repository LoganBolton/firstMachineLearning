i sat down to watch midnight cowboy thinking it would be another overrated 60s70s movie some of my favorite films come from the 70s in the same vein as midnight cowboy taxi driver mean streets panic in needle park etc but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking  unfortunately a vast majority of them dont hold up as well today i sort of feel this way about easy rider although it too is one of my favoritesbr br so i didnt expect much from midnight cowboy but got a lot back its a touching story wellmade and welltold with some of the best performances of all time dustin hoffman as enrico ratso rizzo gives one of his best  its a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks  maybe because of the lennysimpsons connection but hoffman is entirely convincing half of the films budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood opposite him is the secondbilled jon voight as joe buck the cowboy who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ratso  who offers to become joes manager for a certain percentage of profitsbr br the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the 70s because as its been said in easy riders raging bulls the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material going on too long examining charactersscenesetc that arent important just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party  it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug odysseys in easy rider and really harms its flow because its not neededbr br other than that midnight cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture i was pleasantly surprised it does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content midnight cowboy is a truly great motion picture an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late 60searly 70s its a depressing movie yes and by todays standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etcbut i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long timebr br highly recommended one of the best films of the 70s it was technically released in late 1969 but id still categorize it as a 1970s film it also won the best picture oscar being the first  and only  xrated motion picture to do so it was later rerated r on appealbr br 455
