the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the afi critics top 100 for a top 100 it is not a very well known movie indeed i had to look hard to find a copy i got the dvd version for about halfprice surprisingly it was only rated m15 the uncut versionbr br i doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so ill make it briefbr br this is perhaps one of the strangest movies ive seen partly because of the use of montages artistic filming very arthouse and the unusual theme there are many things in the film i still dont understand ive seen it twice and it makes for an emotionally confusing filmbr br the filming and acting were very good and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable the main character is joe buck a cowboy from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute he meets the crippled conman enrico ratso rizzo and of course they become friends going through the usual escapades what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so differentbr br i felt the film didnt really develop the relationship between buck and enrico rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the startbr br i personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes the deprivation of humanity shown by the darkness of the city streets the breakingdown tenements most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law a conman giggoloetc yet you cant help liking them joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the filmbr br i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very groundbreaking for its period at the time and even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite arthouse at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops upbr br on a personal level i must say i quite liked the film the imagery conveyed a dreamlike quality i particularly liked the scene at the party the music images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching however as a movie for entertainments sake it was a bit lacking not really my style of movie in thrills this is a film to be savoured and appreciated rather than a cheap thrills action flickbr br although i would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film the characters and their motives were quite interesting from what i understand from the flashbacks joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother although it still doesnt seem to be relevant to the story he is a happygolucky young stud who suppresses his darker memories the religious connotations in the film are also puzzling some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso although i fail to see where they have got the idea from the theme of homosexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation and later in joe bucks encounter with a lonely old man but it has little to do with the main storybr br certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do while it has a simple sentimental story to it disguised by a hard edge the beauty of the film is in the strange often psychedelic sequences
