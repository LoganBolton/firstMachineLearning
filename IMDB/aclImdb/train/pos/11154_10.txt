in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and its place on the afi top 100 list though its shamefully too low on the imdb top 250 list at only 183 as of this writing if you enjoy acting of the highest calibre voight and hoffman are a superb match welldrawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography youll love this just as much as i did schlesinger paints a vivid always credible picture of the late 60s new york city scene and its many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality poverty and hopelessness of 42nd street new york citybr br the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling ive seen many ideas including the rapidfire editing the handling of the voiceover flashbacks the drugtrip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakersbr br the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having its homosexual underpinnings i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or notbr br midnight cowboy is a brave moving film of magnitude influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of its impact over the years so if you havent seen it youre really missing out on a true american classic i recommend this film to everyonebr br score 10 out of 10
