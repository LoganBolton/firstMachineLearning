i typically dont like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of american idols success but this one i can live withbr br comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do survivor style competitions using comedic tactics then one will be determined as last comic standing i do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden ralphie may and josh bluebr br my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama at first they lived together in a house like big brother but now theyve done away with that thank godbr br and there are a lot of comedians i felt were only chosen not because theyre funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc when other comics clearly shouldve beaten them out but overall its a wellmade reality show which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron
