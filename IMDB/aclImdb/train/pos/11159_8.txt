this is a wonderful film first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and womens baser motivations diverge vive la difference  br br you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses human beings are a bit rubbish really but we have big hearts and we try our best despite temptation its not our fault when sometimes temptation cant be resisted thats just who we arebr br there is a consistent stylishness from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content well suited music and laugh out loud scriptingbr br watch out for the very young lone wise voice brilliant wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition
