probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet not surprising since king himself wrote the screenplay the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house one of the other residents is jud a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard the other is a path leading to the pet sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway soon enough ellie creeds cat church is found dead luckily this happens while the family with the exception of louisthe father is away for thanksgiving jud takes louis to another burial ground beyond the pet sematary where church is to be buried later louis is greetednot so politely by church hes returned appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in maybe he was buried alive maybe not nothing more i can say without ruining the storybr br of all the king adaptions ive seen this would be the most terrifying the characters are real and the situations are normal mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever then of course we have the conclusion easy to determine whats going to happen but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing momentsbr br overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption if you enjoy being scared and dont mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then pet sematary is just what youre looking for non horror fans will want to avoid this
