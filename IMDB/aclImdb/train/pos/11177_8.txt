spoilers hereinbr br what really scares you killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopathbr br maybe but those fears dont even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or considerand that is the death of ones own child pet sematary taps this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explorebr br ive read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc i disagree the acting is actually first rate for a film like this maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario but the films events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible this is the true horror of pet sematary it isnt that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does despite warning or even past historybr br the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect and the results are horrifying in fact when the film dives into slasher territory near the end its almost a letdown although i believe its perfectly logical how it got therebr br i am a true horror fan and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made if you dont think so see it again after you have children
