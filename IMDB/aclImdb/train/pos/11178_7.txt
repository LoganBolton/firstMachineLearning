minor spoilerbr br underrated little stephen king shocker its not perfect by any stretch of the imaginationeven if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better thered still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with the old micmac burial ground rachels terminally ill sister and the jacobmarleyan victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed but few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock pet sematary may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda its politically incorrect its tasteless its gratuitousand yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer horror movies never can add to that one of fred gwynnes best performances and mary lamberts witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movieeven with the hokey ending highly recommended for genre fans 75 out of 10
