pet sematary succeeds on two major situations first its a scary horror movie those that just arent produced in these days second its an emotional clever movie overall so if you are looking for chills scares creepiness and visually stunning settings great acting dialongs and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan br br probably the best adaptation to any of kings novels the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel but that doesnt means that this underrated movie isnt a complete horrordrama accomplishment br br stephen kings novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time the movie captures the same feeling mainly because theres a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between its members then when everything seems to be happiness technically happy because the title pet sematary does not offers appiness a tragic event changes the movies atmosphere now it turns very dark the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad gray creepy dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a familys entire life and pet sematary proves it dramatically br br the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot sadly enough the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time its something much much worse what will happened with the lives of our all american family could pascow prevent this tragedy what is it with the surreal nightmares br br watch pet sematary to witness one of the most touching emotional horror movies of recent times you wont regret the acting is very good although i didnt dig the actor who portrayed the father he didnt seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation but thats just my opinion denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble tender mother baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts shivers overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches peoples deepest fears the loss of someone you love the dead returning to life and a feeling of desperationbr br something is for sure i dont wanna be buried in a pet sematary
