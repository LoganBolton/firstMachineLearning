making a book into a movie by following the story pagebypage is never a good idea when people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress and everybodys mindseye opus is different which is why when the real movie finally comes out youre always going to have a tickedoff segment of the moviegoing audience who are disappointed that it just doesnt measure upbr br all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to seebr br there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying carrie salems lot the dead zone or they can be what fans consider to be a gawdawful mess kubricks version of the shining the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers br br although its not even close to being the perfect king adaptation pet sematary has so many moments of just skinandbonedeep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings for that we have music videoturnedfilm director mary lambert to thank she also directed siesta not exactly a horror movie but another freakyashell mustsee you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the manster himself and probably one of his better onesbr br since the majority of you know the story i wont put you to sleep with too many of the details dr louis creed dale midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a sonwell even if you havent read the book do the frickin math it is a king story after all so no mystery where this is headed br br its not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery screaminducing life here rachel creeds star treks denise crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister louiss encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow brad greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery and that third actif it doesnt give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulsebr br good performances by all here especially the late fred gwynne as the wellintentioned neighbor jud crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up sometimes dead is betterbr br about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louiss son gage miko hughes knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately hughes at the time was just too damn cute to sell his intended role as an evil demonpossessed zombie this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where hes featured are still masterfully staged especially gwynnes death scenebr br other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as im concerned but sematary is right up there in the top fivebr br still will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story not bloody likelyfor now
