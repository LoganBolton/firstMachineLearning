i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen kings books  this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorablebr br i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heartwrenching as well as scarybr br the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out and the no fair uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliancebr br
