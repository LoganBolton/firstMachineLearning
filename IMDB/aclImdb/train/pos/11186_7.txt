in the trivia section for pet sematary it mentions that george romero director of two stephen king stories creepshow and the dark half was set to direct and then pulled out one wonders what he wouldve brought to the film as the director mary lambert while not really a bad director doesnt really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of kings novel of which he wrote the screenplay there are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes mainly involving the sister zelda likely more of a creepout for kids if they see the film and the casting in some of the roles is deadperfect but something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably kinglike atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as youre going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in who knows if hell save that for his final novel br br as mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably miko hughes as gage creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80s horror movie to being a little monster i say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of underplaying and doom in tone and applause goes to whomever did the makeup on andrew hubatsek but there are some other flaws though in the other casting dale midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure creed and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just didnt work for me at allbr br in terms of setting up some chilling setpieces only a couple really standout a certain plotthickening moment not to spoil it does involve a cool ramones song and the first visit to the pet sematary the bigger one including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining for the most part its a very polished directing job though it couldve been made even darker to correspond with the script if thought out in logical terms albeit in king terms it is really one of his more effective works of the period but it doesnt add up like it could or should still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie
