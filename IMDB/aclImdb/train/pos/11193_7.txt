i kind of liked the lonely lady give pia a break she looks great and she has really nice eyes whats not to like the scene where she gets raped by ray liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel actually a lot of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel but its a trashy movie a lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad i liked this better than valley of the dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well at least this wasnt boringbr br pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer watching her talk about pushkin and byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable im sure pias a nice person in real life she just doesnt project the writer vibe she looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from saturday night fever and wearing a glittery disco dressbr br a couple of the scenes are funny the one where she tells the twotiming actor that shes pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to stop hanging around all the while hes practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces bybr br pias nervous breakdown scene is good it was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it the vortex of floating faces and freezeframe scream  whoa and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdonebr br the acceptance speech is a hoot though i want to see someone do that speech in a drama classbr br but again this is trash were talking about you could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties
