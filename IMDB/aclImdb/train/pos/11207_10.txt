this documentary was nominated for an oscar and its easy to see why even 45 years later it is quite an impressive piece of work why it isnt inprint is a mystery that only disney can explain good use of live footage and animation in tandem this used to run as part of vault disney every few months or so but i havent seen it listed in quite a while sigh most recommended
