oh where are you going my little one little onebr br turn around and youre two turn around and youre fourbr br i remember these shows when they were first broadcast on disneyland i remember sitting there electrified by werner van braunes explanations of rocket science i watched as history science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilitiesbr br that was fifty years ago and the shows are back in the disney treasures series and what a treasure they are i watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter who at first would not even come in the room but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated as she watched i watched her and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as i had beenbr br turn around and youre a young wife with babes of your ownbr br sure some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong but there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive i found myself thinking my daughters teacher might want to show them to her class not only as a 50 year old artifact but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in historybr br turn around turn around turn around and againyoure wondering how much has really changed in 50 years
