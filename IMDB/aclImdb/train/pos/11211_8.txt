i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike its even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a strawman villain but the only adversary is the gorilla its an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really cant treat them just like people because they arent not many films venture into this territory and its worth seeing if you want to contemplate the humananimal similarity
