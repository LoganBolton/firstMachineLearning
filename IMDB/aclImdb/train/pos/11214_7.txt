this was the first walking tall movie i saw i think in a 2 movie theater along hollywood blvd  so i didnt have any reference to the first installment done by joe don baker i remember being shocked at the corrupted system of mcnairy county and the brutality of the redneck gangs i was also amazed at the fact that one man decided hes not going to let it slide and went out to do something about it courageous  i thought so  to a point where it sent shivers up my spinebr br i think this movie is a great story about american courage to stand up and do something about a system thats only serving its own interest i was pretty blown away about it and think this is still one of the best movie of the heroantihero genre which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the the punisher but even more so because its a true story the recent remake starring the rock just doesnt do any justice to the real fire in the story of buford pusserbr br a classic that im sure will resurface again in the future
