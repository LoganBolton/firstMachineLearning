the story is extremely uniqueits about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidlythe whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of timefriendsand mentorsbr br the ending could have been fantasticit started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very badbr br the animation is decent for 89 but cant compare to nowadaysi have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudityi actually found it to be somewhat decentthe nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excessbr br overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic
