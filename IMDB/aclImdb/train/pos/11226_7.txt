star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways first its a fan made series available only on the web and it features mainly friends  neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to as mickey  judy once put it put on a show its definitely friends  neighbors to you can tell a lot of these people arent the most beautiful looking folks youve ever seen or the youngest or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like theyre walking on marbles some of them have thick accents or simply dont seem to speak well in the first place whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that theyre saying still you have to admit for everything these friends  neighbors have put together its actually fun to watch yes some of the dialogue is hokey yes its a little odd though admittedly a little cool too watching two starfleet males kiss although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on yes you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from sttos tng other shows and the movies or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show okay we can get by that why the graphics are first rate better than almost anything youve seen and sometimes a show or two really stands out storywise some of them are actually real tearjerkersbr br hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude people sets costumes graphics its a huge effort on a lot of peoples parts we watch we return and we thank them
