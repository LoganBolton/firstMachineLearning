this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering its made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen its story lines are complex and twisting and its characters show realistic depth and dimension the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking while its first season might be a little shaky its final few are well thought out and well shot some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise but these fans dont take no for an answer i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike 1010 hidden frontier crewbr br make it so
