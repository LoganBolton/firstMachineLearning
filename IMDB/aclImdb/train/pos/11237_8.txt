star trek hidden frontier is a longrunning internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of trek the production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that theyre greenscreenin it this doesnt take away from the overall experience however the cgi ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes on the negative side i could tell in the earlier episodes and even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the actorsactresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesnt take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a wholei would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9
