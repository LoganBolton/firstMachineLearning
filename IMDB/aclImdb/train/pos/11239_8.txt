hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internetbased star trek fan series while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter or new voyages hidden frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeedbr br hidden frontier has no physical sets instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally one of hidden frontiers greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in postproduction while this does save a great deal of time its also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in postproduction though it still serves its purpose br br while it may not be everyones cup of tea hidden frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride
