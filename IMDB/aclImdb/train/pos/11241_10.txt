i acquired this one of my alltime favourite films on dvd recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me awaybr br i am a massive fan of hazel oconnor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the will you track its a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth this rates second best to quadrophenia which also starred phil danielsbr br a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80s in which i grew up the ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering babybr br i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing i can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack alonebr br hazel sorry to hear about your dad darling god bless you all xx
