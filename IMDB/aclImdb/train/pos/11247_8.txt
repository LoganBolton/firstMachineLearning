i first saw the film when it landed on us cable a year after it came out it blew my little head away i was only 16 and it was the first new wave music id heard having been a strictly folky classical kid growing up the music mesmerized me as did hazel oconnors amazing look and charismatic vocal performances and phil daniels tough but soft cockney manager just stole my heart but i think my favorite character was jonathan pryces drugged out sax player he was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic he just begged for sympathy favorite scenes the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the trainbr br okay so the movie isnt the rose but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80s exploding with rebellious youth looking for a way out of the dole queue i went to britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere i found when i was therebr br if you get a chance to see it it is a great movie with some wonderful performances and the music will blow you awaybr br
