as a fan of author john le carre ive slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them i found this 1987 adaptation of le carres masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect i was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human dramabr br peter egan gives a great performance as magnus pym the perfect spy of the title carrying on in the long tradition of le carres strong main characters pym is also quite possibly the best egan plays pym who in fact contains many shades of author le carre as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming a perfect spy egan plays pym to perfection as a man always on the run if not from others then from himself egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alonebr br surronding egan is a fantastic supporting cast ray mcanally gives one of his finest performances as pyms con man father rick who as le carre has said is based strongly on the authors own father mcanally plays a man who comes in and out of pyms life and is one of the those responsible for pym becoming a perfect spy in fact if it wasnt for mcanallys performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short careerbr br the rest of the supporting is excellent as well from caroline john as pyms mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to r√ºdiger weigang as the young pyms friend turned controller to jane booker as pyms wife the supporting cast is fantastic special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger pym jonathan haley nicholas haley and benedict taylor who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter eganbr br the production values of the miniseries are strong as well as the miniseries adaptations of tinker tailor soldier spy and smileys people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris edwards the cinematography of elmer cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the scriptbr br screenwrtier arthur hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently the novel was largely at least in its early parts autobiographical in that pyms early life echoed much of john le carres life the script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of magnus pym from young boy to a perfect spy never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight fist fight or james bond style car chase this would be the proof while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for itbr br though it might be overlong for some for those who dont have very short attention spans here is a must see from the performances of peter egan and ray mcanally to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that it is also a trip down what john le carre has called the secret path the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy isnt to be missed
