this is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathiesbr br if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heartwrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak if you can love a monster youll cry for magnus pym the spy who betrays everyone  notably his country his friends and family  a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same peoplebr br there isnt one truly likeable character in the entire story not one loyal moral personality to sympathise with but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkablebr br i really enjoyed it in the end well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character
