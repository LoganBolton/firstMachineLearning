the devils plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production  and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats it is still a little slow and unexplicit for my tastebr br this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle that want to resurrect their previously murdered leader in order to do so the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff  and of course drink some blood too when a doctor and her brothers car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging  they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampiresbut they may not be as helpless as they seembr br the devils plaything is a pretty good example of early 70s exploit sleaze lots of nudity  including some fullfrontal some sleazy undertones  including incest and of course lesbobloodsuckingbut these scenes are still pretty tame by todays standards some pretty hot women in this one would have benefited from some more explicit sex but i guess ya cant have it all also would have benefited from some heavier violencegore being that it is a vampire film but i think the purpose of the devils plaything was more to showcase skin not blood still a little slow  and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden  but thats to be expected from something from this era and of this budget worth a look to exploit fans  others may find it a little too dull for their liking 710
