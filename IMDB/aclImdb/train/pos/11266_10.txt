i recently watched this but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about what the topic wasin short  i had no idea what it was was it a documentary was it a comedy routinewell it was bothbr br it started a little slow but i think thats because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing but it quickly sucked me in the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history mainly how we americans learn history that isnt really true  and how we got to learn what we did he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can bebr br i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics  especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode
