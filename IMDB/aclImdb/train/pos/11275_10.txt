i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd fully restored editions  i never tire of watching them my personal favorite is tarzan and his mate due entirely well almost entirely to maureen osullivans costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front before anyone claims that a  it wasnt really her or b  it wasnt really what it looks like let me say that i have watched it numerous time in high zoom mode and trust meit is her and she is completely naked underneath that costumeseveral times especially during the lion attack at the end careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labiathere is no mistake about that at all as to the swimming scene being a body double in a skin suit yes it is a double but she is not wearing any skin suit or anything elseagain slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it now that controversy out of the way lets move on the actual moviei thought the script was really well thought out and written tightlythe action sequences were simply great although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lionthe use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio  us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which dont complain too much though remember that 90 of all films is phony anyway so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn some cold beer and a fresh pack of smokesa sexy and willing girlfriendwife isnt out of line eitherlol ohone final word about nudityat the very beginning while the white hunters are speaking dialogue keep your eyes on the background extrasthere are several good shots of nude african girls obviously shot on location behind them one more thing the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930s until the 1960sthats the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then shaft hadnt even been thought about at that time nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their headsand tinys character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane as a matter of fact it wasnt until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so
