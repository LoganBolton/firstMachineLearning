tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her backeven if that means killing tarzanbr br this is a raritya sequel thats better than the original tarzan the ape man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult there is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blankand no one really cares but this was 1934 theres also plenty of blood gore and violence for a 1934 movie and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude theres also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and its implied they sleep together and have sexwithout being married this wouldnt bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extremebr br that aside the movie is welldirected very fastmoving and full of adventure and excitement seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and janes outfit is pretty revealing too i still think maureen osullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan everybody else is okbr br this is easily the best weismullerohara tarzan out there well worth seeing but not for kids
