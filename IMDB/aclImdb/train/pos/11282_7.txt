this was the second of the series of 6 classic tarzan movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen osullivan as janebr br as usual this was a wonderful film in this series and perhaps stands out as an in between film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s as such it displayed good pace though not as good as subsequent films likewise the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series the stock i saw was of uneven quality containing some grainy scenery and some underexposed and overexposed scenes the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here on the other hand there is one scene very early on in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle was really almost modern in its style and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the moviebr br regarding plot one interesting feature here was janes nearfickleness and inconstancy when she was being subject to martins flirtations the kiss  and janes stunned and partly guilty reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films compare for example in tarzan finds a son janes duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong here nothing quite so explicit but we have jane returning to the jane parker of yesteryear and in an almost repentant series of actions stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzanbr br there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewingbr br for one thing the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here as later a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experiencebr br i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by todays standardsbr br there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants graveyard tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo and then nursed to health by the apes cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log the final battle scenes of savages  lions on the ground and savages  apes in the trees jane showing us that she is truly of tarzans world now quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions awaybr br the final series of scenes is splendid suddenly tarzan is on the scene flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions and summoning the elephants to the rescue that final cry of tarzan in triumph holding a happy jane in his arms with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and janebr br all in all this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone
