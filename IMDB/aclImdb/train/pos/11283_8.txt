tarzan and his mate the second of mgms tarzan pictures picks up a year after the events of tarzan the ape man tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle and harry holt one of the expeditioners in the first film returns this time accompanied by the lessthanhonorable martin arlington in quest of the ivory from the elephants graveyard naturally a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the waybr br the first film romanticized everythingthe jungle adventure romance itself wild animals and even death the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences but a more serious tone underlies the action the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation it creates a certain amount of somberness that isnt always as much fun as the throwcautiontothewind attitude of the originalbr br one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and janes relationship tarzan still speaks very broken english but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate additionally their love for each other has really blossomed and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the junglebr br most people consider tarzan and his mate superior to the original tarzan the ape man personally i liked the first film just a little bit better the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt  martin arlington team isnt nearly as likable as holts relationship with james parker janes father from the original the mr arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him also i dont want to give anything away but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him jane never finds out about those events so the ending isnt quite as satisfying as it could have been all of these detractors are relatively minor however and its still a great moviebr br like the first film tarzan and his mate has amazing action scenes wonderful wildlife footage and one of the screens alltime greatest romances if you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see
