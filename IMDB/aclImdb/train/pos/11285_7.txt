like tarzan the ape man 1932 only more so theres more of everything more animals more varied african tribes and scenes in which the thought must be if this was good with three or four lions forty would be better tarzan wrestles with crocodiles혰the the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin around and around jaws flapping tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals his friends are real chimps people wearing larger ape costumes and elephants in fact they use indian elephants혰far more friendly and trainable than african ones혰with costume ears attached to their heads the human story another white man worse than the rest shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard tarzan wont show them the way so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed tarzan intercedes and the bad guy shoots him혰but of course he survives and returns to save jane everybody else dies holt and the bad guy and every single one of their boys people are expendable especially africans and there doesnt seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing apparently one of weismullers friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes and not maureen osullivan she however moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears plus a bikini top showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip they still dont need to talk a lot they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities no wonder theyre happy
