i recommend watching this film with your significant other if youre planning a romantic evening with himher the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen osullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screenbr br after the original film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other janes skimpy jungle wear and tarzans protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in lovebr br ones imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan  jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually and janes student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexualitybr br the skin show in this film is off the charts in addition to janes twopiece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan although it is not osullivan but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell  with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hipsbr br its a shame that the overprotective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie
