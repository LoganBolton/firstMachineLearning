considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films i have no argument with that although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining one thing its the longest of the series that ive seen at 105 minutes ive only seen six of them but this was longer than im used to and with the drawnout action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too longbr br nonetheless it is a good mixture of action suspense and romance the only things missing are color and stereo sound the primitive specialeffects dont bother me as that was all that they had back in the 1930sbr br among some this film is most noted for one thing skin jane never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made her outfit showed what a great figure maureen osullivan possessed the nude underwater scene however was not her  by a longshot the woman under the water didnt have a good figure at all whoever it wasbr br there is plenty of action in here up to the finale it was not overdone either the ending went on for 15 minutes though and was so intense that it was almost too much to watchbr br still this movie offers about everything  except boy their adopted son  youd want to see in a tarzan film even osullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times with her pair of lungs that was no problem
