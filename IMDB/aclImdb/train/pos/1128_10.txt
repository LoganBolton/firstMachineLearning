although the recent retelling of part of homers epic troy with brad pitt was entertaining once iphigenia with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity a chance encounter with this film on one of directvs many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems there is no glitter or bling in this movie just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil i think even homer if he really existed would be proud of this tellingbr br jlh
