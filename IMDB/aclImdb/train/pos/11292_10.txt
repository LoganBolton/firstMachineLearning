i saw this movie once as a kid on the latelate show and fell in love with itbr br it took 30 years but i recently did find it on dvd  it wasnt cheap either  in a catalog that specialized in war movies we watched it last night for the first time the audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels even so it was better than i remembered it i was also impressed at how true it was to the playbr br the catalog is around here someplace if youre sincere in finding it fire me a missive and ill see if i can get you the info cartwrightbrideyahoocom
