this movie is a ripoff of james cains novel the postman always rings twice apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this storyperhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties despite this the movie isnt really just an italian version of the hollywood movie in some ways its a lot better and in other ways it is definitely notbr br the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people in fact the male and female lovers are a bit ickylooking the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive they are a very very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version and the illfated husband is really really obese and loves to walk around shirtlessand his counterpart in the american film cecil kellaway is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two italian leads actually and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian filmsince i just could not imagine a finely coiffed dish like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellawayi am 100 sure she would have had dozens of better offers whereas the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believablebr br part of the italian films believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway they never actually get around to sex this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic in addition to the casual sexuality of the film its also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of lifewith lots of sweaty people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bathbr br the movie is also pretty fastpaced compared to the overlong american film and what you get due to brevity isnt all good the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american filmwith grainier footage relatively poor orchestration and sets it sure aint a pretty film but the neorealisticlike style makes the film seem more realistic but it cannot make up for the shortcuts in the plot many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american filmand misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the american filmbr br so which is the better film well a lot of this probably depends on you as for me the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitlesbut it packed a great ending and the italian film was much much more realisticuntil the crappy ending that seemed too rushed so neither film is exactly great but id give my nod to the italian one being a bit better its too bad they couldnt have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film
