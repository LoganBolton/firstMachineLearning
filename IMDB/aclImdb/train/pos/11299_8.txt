well id heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the giallobut actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy the two have pretty much no relation in the sixties and seventies italian filmmakers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released theyve not done that here but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film the postman always rings twice without giving the books author james m cain so much as a credit anyway the plot focuses on gino costa a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a caf√© where a woman named giovanna bragana works he soon learns that shes married to giuseppe a big fat annoying man whom giovanna cant stand to have even touching her he wants the pair of them to run away together but shes not so keen on the idea however fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successfulbr br despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story its based on it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics the story is as you would expect extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film but its not a great film the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters heads theres not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know whats going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reasonalthough its not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m cain classic
