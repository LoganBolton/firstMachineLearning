audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out the structure of the film really divorces from saphappy hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light films of this naturethe neorealist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during postworld war ii times ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war including adultery conspiracy murder pregnancy etc aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty shot onlocation uses natural lighting and most likely nonpopular actors all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film yielding the following theme negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorallybr br the two leadsgino and giovannaare polar opposites yet both carry the mentality were bored and we want to be entertained gino is a drifter a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations giovanna is a bored housewife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence she doesnt want to leave her home and husband but would rather remain where she is because its safer ginos lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves the only difference is that shes too afraid to live it herselfthats why she falls in love with gino he represents everything she wants but doesnt have the courage to get she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandgino is the perfect ticket into that world the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40s feeling somewhat uneasy i mean films prior to the neorealist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before to say the least it was probably a bit alarmingbr br in conjunction with the theme the neorealist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior succinctly put adulterous behavior as shown in the film leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to eliminate giovannas husband karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done they return to their home the atmosphere is dark and biting as can be expected from the neorealist style they are not happy theyre actually more depressed they thought that by eliminating giovannas husband that theyd live happier lives but they were duped the film ends with giovannas deathit being in karmic similitude of her husbands death i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons heres whybr br theres a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen and if so to what extent i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have as the subtext of ossessione asks is adultery and murder evil i think the film eagerly responds yes the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are ironically though towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each others arms inside the car the author of the film shows that their happiness is in fact a façade the car crashes off the cliff and into the river killing giovanna the police arrest gino i think it was the authors intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior in the end karma will come back to haunt them i agree i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship he cant handle the pressure of living in giovannas husband shadow so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl such is typical of the insatiable hedonistic personalitybr br all in all the film seemed very risky for its time the audience however was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought those prewar happygolucky films were no longer being believed moviegoing audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in socalled sin because it was a reflection of their own life problems ossessione then acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading that is a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neorealist film movement
