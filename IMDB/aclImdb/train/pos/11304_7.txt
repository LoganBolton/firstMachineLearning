im not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cains novel the postman always rings twice im not even sure if viscounti acquired the books rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cains story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to viscontis excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i dont think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cains muchpraised book
