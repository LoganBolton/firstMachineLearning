a masterful treatment of james caines the postman always rings twice as luchino viscontis first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless wartorn italy the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neorealist work today a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe 1941 star as the sensuallycharged and illfated lovers who plot to kill her husband unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime excellent direction script acting and cinematography reportedly not as good as the french le dernier tournant 1939 but probably better than the us version 1946 featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles highly recommended
