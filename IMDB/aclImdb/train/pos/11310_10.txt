ossessione adapted loosely or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m cains the postman always rings twice with jack nicholson and jessica lange i cant be certain by first time director luchino visconti is no less outstanding with usage of misenscene music both diegetic and nondiegetic and the acting i didnt know what to expect visconti to do in his approach to the material after seeing la terra trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit but this is a totally character and emotional based drama bordering on melodrama however without the conventions that bog down lesser ones and with the style in the finest path of the budding filmnoir movement visconti creates a debut thats as involving as any other neorealist film neorealism by the way could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather along with de sicas the children are watching us which that would take shape after the war although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neorealist efforts its dealt with in a barebones storytelling fashion and its laced with other familiar themes in neorealism the lowerclass death desperationbr br aside from the story which is simply as it is described on this site the artistry with which visconti captures the images and then layers them with objects a shawl over gino costas profile when in guilt shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film usually over gian and giovanna and the feel of the italian streets in many of the exterior scenes domenico scala and aldo tonti who would lens some of rossellini and fellinis films help in envisioning the look of ossessione which is usually moving in on a character then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly sad and dark and romantic i think ive just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along even as i was in fear of the futures of the two leads the two leads massimo girotti and clara calamai portray all the compelling truthful and nearoperatic emotions and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes br br its a brilliant crushing adaptation and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for visconti in his career
