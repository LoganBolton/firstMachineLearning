wow the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances absolutely incredible if this was viscontis debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film the only other one of his ive seen at time of writing is death in venice  which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than ossessione obsession one of the most beautiful films ive ever seen but its story was not as involving as ossessione if you click on miscellaneous on this pages links there are stills from the movie on those websites they wont really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from james m cains the postman always rings twicebr br i cant believe this was made in 43 eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire 1951 the actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i dont know anything about it  but theyre some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema also eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen ossessione was electrifyingly sensual the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema yes im being superlative but ossessione was just that terrificbr br the reason ossessione didnt cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini and recut in america american audiences didnt see its full glory till 59 eight years after streetcarbr br i wont say any more about it  just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies ive ever seen and tell you to go out and see it like another reviewer im going to buy it as soon as i can find it
