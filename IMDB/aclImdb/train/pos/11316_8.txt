some spoilers i have not read the james m cain novel the postman always rings twice on which this movie was based so i cannot compare this film version to it but i have seen and love the 1946 us version also entitled postmanbr br even better is this gem from italy which i have read was mutilated in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime well no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the forerunner of the neorealist movement in filmmaking one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on a pervading sense of societal and cultural as well as personal oppression remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in lifebr br consider gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and resorting to stowing away stealing and conning people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually uselessbr br in giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the trattoria for her husband slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex in the past she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurantgas station owner giuseppe bregana played by juan de landa anyway knowing that he would not make her happy she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches herbr br on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact pocketed gino wins breganas favor promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life or lack thereof and is left alone with giovanna they immediately start a heated passionate yet volatile love affairbr br gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband wanting no part of it gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsytype man named spagnolo a fellow train passenger to gino spagnolo represents a sort of freedom and they become friends spagnolo also symbolizes ginos morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together finally gino has steady employment to his dismay he is not yet over his love for giovanna a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go back home to live and work with them again as he is handy to have aroundbr br too weakwilled to resist knowing this will reunite he and giovanna gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple after a while he gives in to ginas demands to get rid of her husband once the evil deed is done giovanna becomes more coldblooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequencesbr br i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into ginos life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the storybr br while the 46 us version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters especially the cops and the lawyers ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone this gives the final outcome even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must livebr br a minor quibble the amount of time hardly any that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no botched first attempt as in the us version ginos very quicktoescalate relationship with the dancerhooker  they quickly profess their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met  all rather unrealistic isnt it i found this timeframe problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere otherwise well worth the viewers time the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout recommended
