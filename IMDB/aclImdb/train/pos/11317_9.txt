viscontis first feature ossessione is an adaptation of james m cains the postman always rings twice now im not familiar with that book or the other film versions but i am a big fan of cains double indemnity much more so than i am a fan of billy wilders film version of it in fact the two novellas seem like they must be very similar both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her giovanna the woman in this italian version played very well by clara calamai is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity but she seems very spoiled her husband a great performance by juan de landa is a bit cruel to her but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him hes older than her and unattractive so shes rather fickle when gino shows up a young muscular man it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed she sweats she wants to be with him forever but shes stuck with her husband they break up at first but when they meet again they apparently although this is intentionally vague plan to murder the husband they are successful and they move back to the womans home town to run the bar that her husband owned gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea he wants giovanna but the one thing that he certainly doesnt want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life their relationship quickly crumbles ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters its always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long at two hours and twentytwo minutes i cant for the life of me figure out how it took that long this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film it was after all the first film that won that label we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life without any hurrying to the next plot point ive seen many of viscontis films and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers 1960 his direction is as great as it ever was with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect i also feel the need to point out the films best performance by dhia christiani as a young exotic dancer and parttime prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna shes only in the film for maybe five or six minutes and she has only a few lines its shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time shes absolutely heartbreaking 910
