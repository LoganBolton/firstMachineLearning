i have to agree with everyone else that has postedbr br i watched it quite a while ago but ill tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me crysuch a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didnt explain things properly but it didnt ruin any part of the viewing experiencebr br i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some researchand watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot moreive always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this animebr br i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely id recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characterssome mysteriousand a bit of fantasy actionbr br also even though this was based on a hgame it doesnt have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this wayi have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it
