i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessary to share my point of viewbr br krisana or as it was titled at the theater i saw it fallen follows matiss a lonely latvian archivist as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didnt try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so thats the plot in a nutshell but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act as a detective who investigates the incident tells him we usually dont bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they diebr br comparisons to michaelango antonioni and his blowup will most likely abound in any review you read about krisana the influence of antonionis philosophical and austere style and the story of blowup are clear and in fact writerdirector fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge or at least who he thinks didbr br the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the college film class look and sound of the film he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely faces but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of matiss the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film whether or not that was kelemens intention the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money but this constraint is used to the films advantagebr br krisana succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too selfserious it could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt if you are more concerned with plot this film and its ending may frustrate you otherwise take the time to be engaged by it it is wellworth seeking out
