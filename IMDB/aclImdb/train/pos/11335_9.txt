jakes closet has the emotional power of kramer vs kramer combined with the imagination of pans labyrinth even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pans labyrinth but this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today jakes closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart its a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense a horror movie for the thinking person if youre looking for a slasher movie this wont be your cup of tea but if youre looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you at the screening i saw i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed i highly recommend catching this film
