answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is creepier nastier and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earthbr br the acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the lessthanwonderful script it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten clich√©d line and make it sound vaguely believable young anthony de marco as jake puts in a particularly good performancebr br fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog try it especially if youre not a monster fan this is not a horror flick even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film jakes closet is suitable for mature adultsbr br the whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts
