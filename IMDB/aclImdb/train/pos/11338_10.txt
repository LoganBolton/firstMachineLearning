i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but theres a monster after you br br it was both heartfelt and scary  there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually goodbr br and thats what separated jakes closet from the usual indy film pabulum  an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of bothbr br if its not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd
