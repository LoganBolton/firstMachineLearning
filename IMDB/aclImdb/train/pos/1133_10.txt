this is a delightful movie that is so overthetop that my wife daughter and i found it irresistible the plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities br br i particularly enjoyed kevin klines and sally fields performances i dont anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded fields characters truly desperate need for attention and affirmation  and her almost bipolar swings in mood  played nicely against the background of fields famous infamous you like me oscar exclamation people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world br br i think this is the only movie where i didnt find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization i thought she was spot on in every note she struck robert downey jr teri hatcher cathy moriarty and elizabeth shue were also firstrate as well just a great movie if youre in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh
