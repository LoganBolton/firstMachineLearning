every child experiences trauma growing up and every childs active imagination has gotten the best of them but for jake anthony de marco  of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling  who resembles henry thomas circa 1982 the combination may prove deadly br br a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter sean bridgers late of deadwood and jules brooke bloom cbs miami suddenly decide to divorce leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant  a zombie in his closetbr br jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon matthew josten who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re zombies jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before its too latebr br indie newcomer shelli ryan  who wrote and directed  blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former smartly outweighs the latter with a decent story buoyed by fine actingde marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not acting  all his nuances are very evident of the awkward shy introverted child that many can relate too i certainly can bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality  it doesnt help when dillons mother ruth monette magrath who resembles laura dern is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i wont go into detail but shows why she is the way she is and more importantly how she has also affected her own childbr br the fillmmakers subjective camera is also well employed many angles shown form jakes pov at waistlevel or somewhat skewed ie the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard and the editing is relatively flawless br br ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears anger and stress onto their children here the film is very successful in getting its theme acrossbr br however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a romeros zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan jakes mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavyhanded but again the childs fear of a thing under his bed is universal
