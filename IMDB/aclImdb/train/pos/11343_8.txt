i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s  and it stayed with me its charming loud colourful  a great kids film i put it on for some friends at a party recently  and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la meet the feebles but no  its wholesome clean funbr br jack wild is in fine form as is mama cass and the somehow attractive witchy poobr br if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30s this will recreate that surreal childhood saturday morning vibebr br even if ive realised now that puf himself is a bit crap  as all he does is get captured and run away quality tv movie  if like me you are into death metal  youll love it
