the only part lacking in this movie is shues part as the daughter wanting to follow in her aunts footsteps as a daytime soap star otherwise it would be a perfect 10br br it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script  i have to wonder if a little ad libing wasnt taking place in parts it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with youbr br its a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once id recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nosebr br youll definitely want to watch the last scene closely nurse nan has a little secret shed rather not have shared with youbr br if you love daytime soaps or despise them this move pokes fun in all the right places
