this movie was excellent it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80s i give this movie high marks for its noholdsbarred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated thanks to the regime community this is a graphic movie it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and its tragic remains nothing is candycoated with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo im familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film its not a comedy but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor this movie is a mustsee
