citizenx1995 is the developing worlds answer to silence of the lambs where silence terrorized our peace of mind citizen exhausts and saddens us instead this dramatization of the chikatilo case translates rather well thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equalsbr br citizenx may also argue against the death penalty far better than kevin spaceys the life of david gayle2002br br humans are machiavellian mammals under which lie limbic brains lizardlogic why did two kids who knew better stone to death a toddler they kidnapped why do bloodthirsty women yell lililililililii at acts of obscene terrorism my own term for this is limbic domination the lizardlogic urge to dominate an enemy if you have the words enemyvengeance in your vocabulary youre easily capable of limbic dominationbr br in wwiidevastated 1980s rostov located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea nothing suppressed andrei chikatilos urge for limbic domination from overpowering his layers of civilization chikatilojeffrey demunns easy victims were paupers usually children who rode the interurban train for fun since they couldnt afford anything elsebr br citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such lambs rostovs serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years after the police arrested and let him gobr br the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world in the west votegrabbing by politicians can set up chronic interagency rivalries stymieing a more coordinated response to crime in the soviet union of citizenx however viktor burakovstephen reas killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracybr br geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authorityto the point of complete obscurity in real life too chikatilo had a lifetimes experience blending in and evading capturebr br his pursuer on the other hand sticks out as a strange bird given to unheralded naive outbursts perhaps by design stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov reas russian accent is impenetrable and his burakov is humourless and sullen at odds with everyonebr br so its donald sutherland who walks away with the picture sutherlands colfetisov burakovs boss and at first his only supporter is an overly restrained patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations his reawakening as a logicdriven yet still passionate cop becomes the films cornerstone idealismbr br joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk overseeing the investigation naturally he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect a communist in 1984 a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag supposedly going home andrei chikatilobr br soon he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik detective gorbunovjohn wood insisting that the investigation now focus on known homosexuals the funniest scene of this sad sad film comes during bondarchuks  gorbunovs institutionalized harassment one stupid cop earnestly reports as i suspected comrade its fornication ive made some drawingscue howling laughterbr br 5yrs after the bodies began piling up in 1987 the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovskymax von sydow who termed the unsub citizenx he later also observed to fetisov  burakov that together you make a wonderful person we concurbr br the drawnout pace spread over a decade perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnostopennessthat wasnt the contrast with perestroikarestructuringcouldntve been greater for the case although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations police plans were about to bear fruitbr br in 1990 colfetisov was expeditiously promoted to general his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference staff communications publicitysuddenly all were available in just one night of telephoning around fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbis serial murder task force at quantico where fetisov discovered staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigatorsbr br fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief now colonel burakov of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movies powerhouse watershed scene fetisovs is the most tender apology ive ever seen on film privately i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance he almost whispersbr br a hbo production citizenx is a film of the highest caliber not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak shot exclusively in the most rundown parts of otherwise spectacular budapest but randy edelmans soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelmingand frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and creditsbr br chikatilos actual murders are depicted as bleak aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world this makes the murders seem notentirelyoutofplacebut of course they were as president kennedy reminded us we all cherish the futures of our childrenbr br citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply serial rapists rape to dominate serial killers kill to dominate so do some soldiers such limbic dominators make poor humansbr br warningspoiler the real andrei chikatilo was the worlds most prolific known serial killer convicted he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all soviet union death sentences one shot in the back of the head foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after deathbr br conclusion the best outcome is always the prevention of killings not their prosecution executions merely guarantee societys failure to learn from the complex reality of victims deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of howwhy they died nor do killers learn regret if theyre deadbr br vengeance doesnt unkill victims baying for the killers blood constitutes nothing better than counterdominationonce its too latebr br vengeance on behalf of the grieving isnt justice for the deceasedits appeasement of the living1010
