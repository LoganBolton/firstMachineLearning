i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was the performances were extremely good especially by rea as the compassionate nononsense detectivebr br despite a low budget no big fx or flashy camerawork citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just telling the storybr br true stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and thats the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn
