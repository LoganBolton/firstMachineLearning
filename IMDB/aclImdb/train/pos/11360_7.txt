chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a jackthestripper type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results perhaps mostly due to stephen reas excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov supporting actors especially max von sydow carried out their parts really well good directing the photography was good too needless to say the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations but frankly given the depth of the storytelling and interpretations we can completely forget these little trivialiabr br for once a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps recommended especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which i hasten to add are never exaggerated
