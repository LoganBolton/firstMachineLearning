okay lets start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of andrei chikatilo while it may have been official policy in the politburo that the ussr had no serial killers in actuality the legal system had handled others and killer x as he was actually called was already being sought when fetisov brought burakov onto the case in fact as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters its good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only based upon actual events for a docudrama this aintbr br spoilers followbr br that said this is a damn good example of a fastpaced hollywoodstyle thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened it is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing yes chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults both male and female yes shoddy labwork set him free to continue killing for years yes innocent men were accused of the murders and confessed to their crimes at police urging yes the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed albeit with burakovs committed assistance and yes chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor gorbunov but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named bukhanovsky though gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film quibbles about truth and veracity aside all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fearbr br it doesnt hurt that director and cowriter chris gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast stephen reas growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in detecting clues donald sutherlands snarky manipulation of the soviet party hacks and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed jeffrey demunns seething undercurrent of rage hidden by a fearfilled demeanor max von sydows boyish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be underestimatedbr br taken for what it is citizen x is almost pitch perfect the almost due to one moment of selfcongratulation at the end that just does not fit highly recommended as fiction welltold not fact being presentedbut considering the junky serial killer movies that hollywood usually spits out thats good enough for me
