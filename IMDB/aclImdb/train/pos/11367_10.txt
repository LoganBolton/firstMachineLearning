caution may contain spoilersbr br ive seen this movie 3 times  ive liked it every time upon seeing it again im always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this wouldve gotten oscars for its performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tvbr br as im sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer andrei chikatilo he murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former soviet union 3 victims were buried  couldnt be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain  frustration according to this acct burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion 3 years later in this scene his superior general fetisov played by donald sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he shouldve given him a break soonerbr br reas performance is so well done he doesnt overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but doesnt show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he doesnt need to overact he just is  his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says hed rather find 3 at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futilitybr br a mutant to be sure chikatilos childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn he somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well donebr br donald sutherland as colonel fetisov later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesnt seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping burakov there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking forbr br although this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events  place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the factsbr br 9 out of 10 stars
