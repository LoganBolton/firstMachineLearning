a surprisingly complex and well crafted study of the first serial killer in the ussr set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of stephen reah and donald sutherlandbr br this examination of cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and by hinting at some of his behaviors while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic not for the weak of heart however as its subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to its full development of the main participants in this fact based storybr br hbo has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner congrats to the director and editor of this great piece it is in my top 10 must see list
