there i was sitting alone in my flat on a saturday night with the choice of watching citizen x or the eurovision song contest  and for the benefit of americans reading this ill explain that tesc is an annual event where musicians from countries all over europe and asia minor have a song contest at the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was  its a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when i say that singing and songwriting isnt of the calibre of lennon and mccartney  and i should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word  choice  is misleading because being a music lover i wasnt going to watch tesc under any circumstancebr br so i sat down as the credits rolled for citizen x expecting a run of mill serial killer whodunnit  but id be misleading everyone calling it that its obvious within the first 10 minutes of citizen x whodunnit  what the film does is point out the failures of communism   a serial killer comrade  this is the soviet union  serial killers can only exist in decadent imperialist capitalist systems  this farcical attitude goes far beyond denial  theres a scene where an undercover cop sits in a freezing train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because its the only warm coat hes got  and of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without interrogation something which will affect the final death toll  all this is very well done as we are shown that its the communist party system thats on trial but about two thirds of the way through citizen x we find ourselves in 1990 as communism is on its last legs and reforms to the police investigation have taken place  its at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film descends into an average manhunt film  but dont let that put you off  citizen x is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially donald sutherland as a paternal police chiefbr br strangely enough a few years ago i read something written by the famous criminologist colin wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight  and i found myself almost sympathising the party chiefs denying there could be a serial killer in the soviet union after all media is controlled by the party and anyone whos old enough to have listened to radio moscow or read english translations of pravda will know that the ussr only reported news stories like potato harvests  coal production and thank you letters from afghanistan  cuba etc for soviet assistance  the concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical  but i guess if a tree falls in a remote siberian forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it
