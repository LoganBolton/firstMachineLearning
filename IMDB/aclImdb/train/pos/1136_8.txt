im not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler but im playing it safe so dont read this if you havent seen the moviebr br i adore this movie and so does everyone i work with  and that is the point i spent a large part of my working life in cinema without being an actor such people are the sung heroes of this movie the gaffers the pullers the onair directors the lighters and writers the costume people etc etc and the whole thing is told from their point of view at least to a great extent most actors are nuts and selfabsorbed to the point of absurdity which is what this movie spoofs so well but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is reallife drama possible spoiler alert in one great scene the two leads both actors are discussing how to discuss something personal something entirely outofscript with another actor and they start making up lines rehearsing them and critiquing each others performancebr br since this movie appeared in what was it 91 it has become fashionable to do this especially on tv but hardly anyone has done it so well
