heres an oddity a modernday film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noisesand it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrificbr br the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and its very interesting all the way throughbr br rea is outstanding as the determined harriedlooked detective jeffrey demunn is downright scary as the killer donald sutherlands russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmthbr br once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorishcrudebigoted yadda yadda yadda br br otherwise its an intelligent and refreshingly lowkey crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not wellknown but is wellliked by the people who have seen it since its based on a truelife account of this killer its all the more chilling dont pass this by just because you havent anything about it
