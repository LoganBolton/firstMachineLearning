this has to be one the best movies about serial killers that ive ever seen and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved silence of the lambs hbo has hit the jackpot here this film is compelling from the first moment until the lastbr br this film has so many underlying themes its hard to tell exactly what it is about it chronicles the decadelong search for the russian serial killer andrea chikatilo stephen rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation and donald sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him both of their performances are subtle masterpiecesrea begins naive and unwilling to compromise while sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation towards the end rea becomes more worldweary and beaten by the system while sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealisticbr br in any other movie i would have said that sutherlands performance stands out above the rest but here even it is rivaled by jeffrey dumann as the serial killer himself dumann brilliantly creates a character here who inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would findhe is a monster but he doesnt want to be and we get the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are he is tortured ashamed but vicious as wellbr br if you can take the incredibly dark subject matter and it is very disturbing then you should see this movie
