citizen x tells the story of andrei chikatilo the ripper of rostov who killed 52 people in 8 years time mainly women and children it shows how the investigation was obstructed by soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave noone untouched in the beginning its perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds i can only say that next to the silence of the lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer ive ever seen br br it is very hard to say which actors performance stands out above the rest in this movie stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation donald sutherlands performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as reas and what to say about jeffrey dumann playing the serial killer dumann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his coworkers he is tortured ashamed as well as extremely viciousbr br i can only recommend this movie to everybody whos interested in a wellmade docudrama where the actors are still more important than the special effects it deserves at least a 910 perhaps even more if you ask me
