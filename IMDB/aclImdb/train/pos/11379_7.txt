blood castle aka scream of the demon lover altar of blood ivannathe best but least exploitation cinemasounding title and so on is a very traditional gothic romance film that means that it has big creepy castles a headstrong young woman a mysterious older man hints of horror and the supernatural and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term it also means that it is very deliberately paced and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement if you love films like robert wises the haunting 1963 but you also have a taste for late 1960searly 1970s spanish and italian horror you may love blood castle as wellbr br baron janos dalmar carlos quiney lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional unspecified european village the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman she soon after ends up deadthe consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy appetite for women at the beginning of the film yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilatedbr br meanwhile dr ivanna rakowsky erna schürer has appeared in the center of the village asking to be taken to baron dalmars castle shes an outoftowner who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry of course no one wants to go near the castle finally ivanna finds a shady individual who becomes even shadier to take her once there an odd woman who lives in the castle olga cristiana galloni rejects ivanna and says that she shouldnt be there since shes a woman baron dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay she ends up staying but somewhat reluctantly the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns which the barons brother igor is suffering frombr br unfortunately the barons brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre blackish liquid and furthermore ivanna is having bizarre hallucinatory dreams just what is going on at the castle is the baron responsible for the crimes is he insane br br i wanted to like blood castle more than i did as i mentioned the film is very deliberate in its pacing and most of it is very understated i can go either way on material like that i dont care for the haunting yes im in a very small minority there but im a big fan of 1960s and 1970s european horror one of my favorite directors is mario bava i also love dario argentos work from that period but occasionally blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times there are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castlebr br but the atmosphere of the film is decent director josé luis merino managed more than passable sets and locations and theyre shot fairly well by emanuele di cola however blood castle feels relatively low budget and this is a roger cormanproduced film after all which usually means a lowbudget though often surprisingly high quality quickie so while there is a hint of the lushness of bavas colors and complex set decoration everything is much more minimalist of course it doesnt help that the retromedia print i watched looks like a 30year old photograph thats been left out in the sun too long it appears washed out with compromised contrastbr br still merino and di cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals for example a scene of ivanna walking in a darkened hallway thats shot from an exaggerated angle and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only there are also a couple ingmar bergmanesque shots where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the framebr br the performances are fairly good and the womenespecially schürerare very attractive merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres with english titles such as sex life in a womans prison 1974 naked and lustful 1974 strip nude for your killer 1975 and erotic exploits of a sexy seducer 1977 blood castle is much tamer but in addition to the nudity there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage and of course the scenes mixing sex and deathbr br the primary attraction here though is probably the story which is much a slowburning romance as anything else the horror elements the mystery elements and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses but in the end blood castle is a love story about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms often with physical threats or harms to be together
