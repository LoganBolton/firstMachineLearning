although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show in american in paris he choreographs some outstanding numbers some which stall the plot but are nonetheless amazing to look at check out gene kellys getting out of bed routine for startersbr br gene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris he stayed there to paint soon he is a rich womans gigolo but he really loves someone else hoary story sure but the musical numbers save the show here i really loved georges gu¨¦tarys voice work in this one his stairway to paradise and his duet with le gene on s wonderful is s marvelous oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave all in all a pretty good but not dynamite movie
