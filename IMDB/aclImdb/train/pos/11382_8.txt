what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasnt because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative mindsbr br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscarwinning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner dont have to tell or even relate to the stories whats important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the filmbr br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words dont fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasnt even got a girl yet but the way its done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rulebreaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie carons characterbr br and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasnt really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnellis colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetarys meeting in the café a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the pictures colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tralala he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animatedbr br the achilles heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you dont mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin in the rain which doesnt really have as many great routines or memorable setpieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an allencompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tearjerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show
