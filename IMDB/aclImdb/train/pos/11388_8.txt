if i remember ira gershwin the lyricist and brother of george offered the gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers in many respects it was a typical 50s movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by vincente minelli with a lot of help from gene kellybr br the gershwins were of course among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but in my opinion george himself was among the greatest of all american composers period gene kelly was of course one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical one guess as to the other and i dont imagine his casting was ever in doubt but i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation oscar levant was a noted personality in his time and as an actual friend of george gershwin he had to be in this film he was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here as always he plays himselfbr br leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french gamin type a talented dancer she was never a real beauty george guétary who plays the part of maurice chavalier oops i mean henri baurel was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french boulevardier even if a little too young for the partbr br genes hoofers voice is serviceable here but guétary has much the better vocal equipment though gene was better cast elsewhere as obviously in singin in the rain where his character is much more calculating even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times he was not for nothing cast as the original heel joey in pal joey the broadway musical i was not so enchanted with his i got rhythm scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinionbr br i also found nina fochs character milo to be rather irritatingbr br but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french impressionist paintersbr br i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar as struggling artists and i dont think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but on balance the gershwin music is very well served in this filmbr br the dvd is welldone with fine clear graphics when they are supposed to be and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow
