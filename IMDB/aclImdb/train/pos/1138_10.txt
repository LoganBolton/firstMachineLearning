when i was a kid of 8 i always watched movies and television that i wasnt supposed to and this was one of them br br its one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they dont make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomitinducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny nonactors like seth rogen barfbr br this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades
