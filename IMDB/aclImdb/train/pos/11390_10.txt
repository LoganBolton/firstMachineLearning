the story and music george gershwin are wonderful as are levant guetary foch and of course kelly one things missing and that thing is a good leading lady im sorry leslie caron bothers me anyway despite her the plot moves along nicely with the famous and deservedly so ballet oh the colours the dazzling reds blues greens and yellows musnt forget the beiges as well   i just adore the contrast between the beaux arts ball completely black and white costumes and the eversobrilliant balletbr br so i suppose what im trying to say is this please by all means see it and enjoy it because though it isnt the best it is marvelous but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward
