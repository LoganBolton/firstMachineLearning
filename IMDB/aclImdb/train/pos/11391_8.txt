an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely majestic others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before singin in the rain he is definately one of the all time greats it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kellys characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in labr br some have said that leslie carons acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levants short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesnt look like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isnt an easy task yet levant did it with as much class as any other leadbr br the song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasnt much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if youd spent four hours with them ingeniousbr br i would have to rate this film up with singin since it is very similar in story and song singin would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performancebr br full recommendationbr br 810 stars
