okay so the plot is on shaky ground yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song andor dance sequences for example adams concert and henris stage act and leslie caron cant really um you know actbr br but somehow an american in paris manages to come through it all as a polished firstrate musicallargely on the basis of gene kellys incredible dancing talent and choreography and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron he needs to because she seems to have a problem with emoting br br the most accomplished and technically aweinspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16minute ballet towards the end of the film its stunningly filmed and kelly and caron dance beautifully but my favourite number would have to be kellys character singing i got rhythm with a bunch of french schoolchildren then breaking into an array of american dances it just goes to prove how you dont need special effects when youve got some real talentbr br not on the classics level with singin in the rain but pretty high up there nonetheless worth the watch
