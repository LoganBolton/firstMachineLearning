i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this films page because some of it was slightly misinformativebr br originally i posted quotes from the original poster but i wasnt sure if it was proper given that this is the comments index and not a message board though we used to use em that way back before imdb added the film message boards so i will edit this to make it unnecessarybr br well first of all you may not be aware of this but gene kelly first became famous for playing pal joey on broadway in the original production when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin panorama film he wanted kellys character to be more sophisticated than the goody two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of for me and my gal alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of pal joey this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to pal joey in my opinion the wb film pal joey is a wreck though sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction br br you complain that kellys pictures are not well done even citing your art education to prove the point but you miss the fact that kellys bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the storycharacters the pictures are so bad the audience knows that kelly isnt ready for an exhibition even he knows it though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her but its important that the audience not be sitting there saying but hes a great artist if he only had the chance you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficienciesbr br then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story he refuses because he doesnt want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows hes not really ready for the exhibition his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as joeys enthusiasm to start a nightclub but it serves the same function in the plot remember its essential in pal joey the play that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesnt deserve it same with the art show if kellys paintings were actually good it would undermine this whole point br br then you complain that caron and kelly have no chemistry i guess its in the eye of the beholder i agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in the pride and the passion br br when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film it just shows that you havent dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism its about finding love enjoying love then losing love he looks around and his love is gone the movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships if you didnt see that its not the movies fault its certainly not a load of crap
