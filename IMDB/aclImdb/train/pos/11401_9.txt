an american in paris was in many ways the ultimate mixture of art and hollywood musical made at the height of mgms powers as a musical powerhouse the film features memorable music from the gershwins who rightly have been called the 20th centurys equivalent of beethoven and mozart br br gene kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warmup for his best work in singin in the rain 1952 the two films are actually closely linked aside from the arthur freed connection the broadway melody segment in rain owes its existence to the incredible american in paris ballet sequence in this film this might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film and it deserved to be as it showcases gene kellys skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degreebr br the films cast is uniformly excellent leslie caron incredibly making her film debut shows a maturity that makes you think shed been making films for years her introductory dance sequence and later her work on the ballet provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in mgm musicals only by cyd charisses work in singin in the rain and the band wagon oscar levant is hilarious as kellys stoic pal who gets two of the films best moments during the end party sequence which i will not give away for anyone who hasnt seen the film and one of the films most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with stateoftheart for the time special effectsbr br less memorable are georges guetary as kellys romantic rival though he does get a few musical highlights and nina foch as leslie carons romantic rival the maydecember relationship between kellys character and ninas reminded me of the same kept man relationship seen between george peppard and patricia neal in breakfast at tiffanysbr br there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than singin in the rain the ballet though lavish and wellproduced doesnt really fit with the rest of the movie without giving away the plot the ballet just happens with no real rhyme or reason and unlike the broadway melody sequence it really doesnt have anything to do with the plot  and in the best musicals the songs always have some sort of raison detre br br making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the ballet although the ending shouldnt be a surprise this is an mgm musical after all i was hoping for a bit more  movie after the ballet ended its as if director vincente minnelli felt that he couldnt follow the ballet with anything else the film literally left me in the lurchbr br that negative aside an american in paris rightly ranks alongside the best of hollywoods musicals it doesnt quite reach the heights of singin in the rain but it comes close and it remains a testament to gene kellys skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time
