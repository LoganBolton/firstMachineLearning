parsifal 1982 starring michael kutter armin jordan robert lloyd martin sperr edith clever aage haugland and the voices of reiner goldberg yvonne minton wolfgang schone director hansjurgen syberbergbr br straight out of the german school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and ingmar bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of wagners final masterpiece parsifal written to correspond with good fridayeaster and the consecration of the bayreuth opera house this film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avantgarde and no other parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography syberberg is known for controversial films prior to this film he had released films about hitler and nazism richard wagner and his personal antisemitism and a documentary about winifred wagner one of his granddaughters this film is possibly disturbing in many aspects parsifal sung by reiner goldberg but acted by michael kutter is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of kundrys kiss is transformed into a female this genderbending element displays the femininemasculineyingyang nature of the quest for the holy grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through christs blood in the pagan sorcerer klingsors fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as hitler nietzche cosima wagner and wagners mistress matilde wesendock the swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film the tempting flower maidens are in the nude kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary magdalene or eve from genesis played by edith clever but beautifully sung by mezzosoprano yvonne minton ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre germaniceuropean symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of wagner opera indeed the singing is grand and compelling reiner goldbergs parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater parsifals of the stage  james king wolfgang windgassen rene kollo and todays own placido domingo yvone minton is a sensualvoiced dramatic and exciting kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly while the production is certainly unorthodox and as unwagnerian as it can possibly get wagners concept was christian ceremonial pomp with grails spears castles knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical wagnerian themesit is still an enjoyable arthouse film
