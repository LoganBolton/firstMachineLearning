this very peculiar setting of wagners last opera definitely grew on me when i first saw it i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story however if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch√© gimmicks i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange otherworldly atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments which are particularly finebr br personally i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her her performance a lipsynchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton is nothing short of dazzling from end to end and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the filmbr br another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times and the lusciousness of his voice and the warm fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved as did his performance in the characters two major monologues the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act 1br br the version i have seen was a videotape made for america and so there were subtitles which alas could not be done away with this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagners clear avoidance of christianity and his very deliberate attempt to generalize the christian elements of the story see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review i find it nearly impossible when viewing a film with subtitles to keep from absorbing them and strongly recommend that if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off you do so and instead if the opera is unfamiliar to you that you read the libretto carefully beforehandbr br the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike and would just as soon have seen done differentlybut it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and againbr br br br footnote containing a spoiler a good example would be kundrys famous line i saw himhimand laughed this gets translated in the subtitles for reasons which escape me as i saw the saviors face it is especially irritating to me because throughout the libretto wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as der heiland ie the german for the healera reference to the wound of amfortas and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing
