updated january 1st 2006br br parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner operas or music dramas to be more accurate meistersinger is the other though its hard to imagine it as the top of anyones pops the libretto by the composer as usual is a muddle of religion paganism eroticism and possibly even homoeroticism and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint drybr br wagner being a famous antisemite klingsor may be one of his surrogate jewish villains naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted not for want of rws trying hermann levi who was his favorite conductor go figure kundry a most mixedupgal and another likely jewish surrogate is both villainous or benevolent depending on the scenebr br considering that many video versions of parsifal seem on the stodgy side this film of the opera is in comparison a breath of fresh air hansjürgen syberberg the director has brought considerable imagination to it but its hard to know why he made some of his choices for example the notorious dual parsifals of each gender the puppets the deathmaskofwagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes if i remember the real engelbert humperdinck wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes though wagner himself died much too early to be an actual nazi many of his descendants as well as his second wife cosima were at least fellowtravelers including their grandson wolfgang wagner who still runs the bayreuth festival at an advanced age in fact wolfgangs son gottfried wagner in complete opposition to his father has tried to come to terms honestly with his greatgrandfatherbr br syberberg too seems politically ambiguous from what ive read in 1977 he made a wellknown film on hitler hitler ein film aus deutschland sometimes called our hitler in english since it lasts all of 8 hours and hasnt been widely distributed most people have not seen it including myselfbr br armin jordan the conductor of the audio cd on which this film is based plays amfortas sung by wolfgang schöne edith clever yvonne minton plays kundry michael kutter and karin krick play the dual parsifals both sung by reiner goldberg and robert lloyd and aage haugland both play and sing gurnemanz and klingsorbr br though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all except kundry have been described as having aged considerably between acts 2 and 3 no one looks a day older by the end of the opera the magic of the grail in this opera the grail is the cup from which jesus drank at the last supper and not mary magdalene as in more recent times an idea i find preposterousbr br the conducting and singing are all quite serviceable and the dvd seems to have improved the sound if not the picture to a great extent yes i agree that knas approach is superior even on the second stereo version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the wholebr br not a parsifal for all wagnerites but i think it works quite well as a filmed opera
