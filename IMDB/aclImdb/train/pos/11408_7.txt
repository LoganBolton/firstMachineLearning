etienne girardot is just a character actorthe sort of person people almost never would know by name however he once again plays the coronerone of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once ive already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot there are many other wonderful character actors along for the rideincluding grant mitchell gene lockhart henry walthal kent smith hb warner and nat pendleton this is quite an impressive cast and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia brucebr br these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old bmovies while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific because of the breezy writing and acting the films really satisfy as for this film vance is played wonderfully by lowe but like i said the mystery itself is only an afterthoughtwith a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides unfortunately you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sorti have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film i would have done it used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets br br overall while not the best philo vance film it was very good and its a darn shame lowe only played this role once in fact aside from william powell who played vance five times the series was hindered by a long long succession of actors such as basil rathbone wilfred hydewhite and warren william and many others playing vance this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond seriesjust too many different actors playing the leading manbr br well worth seeing and excitingthough also quite impossible
