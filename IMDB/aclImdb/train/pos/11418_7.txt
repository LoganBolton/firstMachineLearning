i first saw this film during and international film studies course i am a nontraditional student and perhaps for reasons of yearslived or wisdomaccrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the films narrative languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multilayered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the other in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider made nearly 20 years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered much more lavishly filmedand heavily financed works that have been made since reflect the same themes indochine nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make chocolat seem pale and boring it has no adrenalinepumping action or extreme violence the struggles are mental emotional and subtle but that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing
