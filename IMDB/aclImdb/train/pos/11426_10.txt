i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the 50s and 60s rather than as a story because there is no real story here just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that dont mean much until you have enough to paint a picture the first time i saw chocolat i didnt really get it until having thought about it for a few days then i realized there were lots of things to get including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner just no plot anyway its one of my alltime favorite movies the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry if you like exciting movies dont watch thisyoull be bored to tears but for some of you you can thank me later for recommending it to you
