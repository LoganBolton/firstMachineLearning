my 3rdyear french classes always enjoyed this film very much in a multicultural innercity high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in french in class but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class the most obvious is the relationship between protée and aimée compared to the one between protée and francebr br i always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the sexiest scenes i had ever seen in a movie one year a 17yearold africanamerican shouted yes when he figured out the scene the one where protée is helping aimée lace up her evening dress all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror directors use the mirror technique when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique and it is sexybr br most students had trouble understanding the end of the film one suggested that one theme of the movie was africanism and that no matter how much one loved africa or africans one cannot become african like the driver tried to do one must be african
