i dont watch soaps my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass i made fun of them it when i was ten it was so easybr br but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way i found the story pretty damn funny the fashions of the 80s  shoulder pads sequins and polyester  just top it off the huge hair the high heels and the histrionics  what a combinationbr br and all the actors just go to town chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile sally kevin elisabeth  wonderful whoopi  great robert downey  refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before the tabloids and garry why did we have to wait so long to see him on film leesa gibbons  hadnt been missing her but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for that job anywaybr br admittedly i could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe lucy ricardo did it how many times as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i dont know who and im so done with it now i could spit peanuts if i had them apparently its what you do when youre being funny in a tall building in new york im just thankful they didnt pull out the flagpole bitbr br but it was cute it was funny it had plot twists it had an after credits ending before that was common it had clothes worthy of a second glance it had a great cast and its got personal memories for me really what more do you need
