i went and saw rivers and tides again today its the second time in two days and yes i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthys works this morning when i threw the coins i received 29 the abysmal water goldsworthy has an affinity with water hence the title i received the 5th line changing which moved to 7 the army to blake art was a war anyway i knew i had to see the film againbr br i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner the critic loved the film but said goldsworthys comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film hed rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack so i was aware of that as i watched this second timebr br yesterday i thought that id vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art his understanding of water time stone change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar some of his workwords are zen like his knowledgebr br anyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the bay area be a trend setter go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film youve heard about from the hinter lands its called rivers and tidesbr br
