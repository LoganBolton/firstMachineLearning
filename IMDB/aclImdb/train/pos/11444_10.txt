go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthys sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eyeopening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andys musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artists works and is used expertly in this respect
