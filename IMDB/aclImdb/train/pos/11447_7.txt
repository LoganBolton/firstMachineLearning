this movie is probably for you it had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often cliché things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots if youre familiar with buddhism that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film the impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc however what i did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing i saw over an hour of it was the redundancy of the whole thing you only find out bits and pieces of why hes commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends
