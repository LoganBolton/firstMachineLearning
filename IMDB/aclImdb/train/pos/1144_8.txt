way back in 1955 the british made a comedy called simon and laura with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall to this day it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and more particularly about how television sitcoms become so popular it was and is an excellent example also of selfreferential cinemabr br so also soapdish a film id never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well as you knowbr br however i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv in fact its been a while since i laughed so heartily so if you like satire id recommend you see itbr br the main actors  sally field kevin kline robert downey and cathy moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is as i watched it i kept thinking to myself just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life that is if actors ever do have a real life as you probably know peter sellers for example was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters so that nobody really knew the real person so as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finchbr br is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter lori played by elizabeth shue and in an emotional moment repeats the fictional lines shed used on a prior episode of her daytime soap when confronting her fictional daughter in that show are you confused well its not all like that but the dialog is stunning for originality comedy bitchiness anger depravity duplicity and evenlovebr br the story well there are many stories in this film all interwoven and which all come together at the end of course  but not like a robert altman film okay and not all of them are resolved finally lifes not like that anyway right the pace is almost frenetic and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it you wont regret the time usagebr br the rest of the cast all perform well although ive never taken much to whoopi goldberg perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and for my money the latter steals so many scenes from others she gets my vote as the outstanding player i kid you not she gives the term bitch an entirely new face
