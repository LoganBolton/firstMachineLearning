a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature his work is made of rocks leaves grass ice etc that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field thus most of goldsworthys works dont really last except as photos or films of what they were now one can argue that goldsworthys works are a reflection of mortality or words to that effect but isnt it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter pretentious often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings goldsworthy seems to be the opposite a stable unpretentious family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland of course im sure those are the same reasons why hes shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial
