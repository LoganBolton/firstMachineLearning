the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks assembling rocks into eggshaped cairns filling riverside rockpools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery near where i live but although i found these pieces intriguing i only realised the wonder of goldsworthys work when i was lucky enough to catch a rescreening of rivers and tidesbr br thomas reidelsheimers film accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snakelike thread set atop a treestump working with his teeth and bare hands goldsworthy crafts a beautiful ephemeral work before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight this scene is among the most beautiful in the film but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthys work is remarkable reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine even if for just a few hours minutes or secondsbr br goldsworthy himself provides the narration speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work he makes plain his need to work with nature to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials even when they seem to be working against him at times he is downtoearth and humorous at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose Â– something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand the rivers and tides of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artists hands flowing from one form to the next the capture of the creation and dissolution of goldworthys work is in itself a striking piece of artbr br although goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across north america and europe the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new a brief interval in which we are introduced to andys family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks nevertheless reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing goldsworthy and his creations locating them in their wider environments from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish hillsides fittingly the film ends with goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist
