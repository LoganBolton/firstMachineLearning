on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when im not out here alone for any length of time i feel unrootedbr br i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists im familiar with his works mainly through his coffeetable books and a couple art gallery installations but to see his work in motion captured perfectly through riedelsheimers lens was a revelation unfrozen in time goldsworthys creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashingbr br and thats precisely what hes all about time the process of creation and destruction of emergence and disappearing of coming out of the void and becoming the universe and back again theres a shamanic quality about him verging on madness you get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didnt do it he would whither and perishbr br luckily for us goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person
