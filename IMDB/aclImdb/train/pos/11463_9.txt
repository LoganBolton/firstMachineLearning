i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastici know it wont but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching im looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it  its very very good very powerful and intensethe end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because its almost too realistic their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable i really hope it gets the attention it deserves its done in the same format as the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film  but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if youve got the chance you really should see it
