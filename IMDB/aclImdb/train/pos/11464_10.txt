what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andrenormal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we arent ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesnt believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you cant believe its really happening and that its really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter
