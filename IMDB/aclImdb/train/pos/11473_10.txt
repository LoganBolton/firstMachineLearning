zero day is a film few people have gotten to see and what a shame that isbr br when i saw the end where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people then commit suicide and it made me grab my stomach i was shaking thats how strong this movie isbr br the movie is amazing its too incredible not to get a perfect ten its sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film it is not a budget which makes a film good it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it goodbr br it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out it makes you realise the true horror of shootings especially if you were to know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these peoplebr br i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it i am fourteen and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words it feels like youre watching something that actually happened
