cutting to the chase this is one of the most amazing most intense film ive seen in a long time the first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered i could barely feel my way out of the theatre i was so overwhelmedbr br ive been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film and just failing highlighting any one aspect of it  the documentarystyle video diary format the unflinching portrayal of the events the force of the characters  just seems to trivialise it all some may find it laughable that any killer could be characterised as normal but then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth many are quite regular unassuming people theyre just wired differentlybr br and thats perhaps the most chilling thought of all
