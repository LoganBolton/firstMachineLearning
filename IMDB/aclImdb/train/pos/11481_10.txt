high school friends andre kriegman and cal gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school as they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their missionbr br there is another similar movie like this called elephant why do i bring this up to compare the two films of course i have to say even though i liked elephant this is a much better film whats the difference you ask well for starters this is shot differently much along the lines of cloverfield blair witch project and diary of the dead this makes the movie all the better because its much more painfully realisticbr br but what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the other side of the story you get to know these two shooters unlike elephant i actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and thats a good thing because its not always black and whitebr br to be honest this is why i almost cried in this movie the characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions you get to understand them its not like they want to kill people for attention overall this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than elephant
