i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero dayand im surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social messagewell mrimareviewer its an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social chargebr br not that i want to expose my life here but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go reject  ignorance on the menu thing isi understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror high schools have became battle fields of conformity its a real ugly sight you need to fight your way into being like the others its hard to explain bit a lot of people dosent realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence meanwhile parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfectbr br the real motive of the movie isnt about what is driving them its about this deathlike calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town cal expressed it well its a wake up call drama is everywhere and it can take every shape in that case little dramaslike andre being called a faggot for wearing a jc penny shirt are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town andre  cal took the most extreme way to express their pain the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be acceptedbr br i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre  cal like if with the pain they communicated cal  andre have communicated their blind rage to their community their refusal to think about the causes of some acts br br it might seemed aggressive as a movie but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating what andre  cal are living is a realityand a scary one that might get to other kids br br disturbing moviehome making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie
