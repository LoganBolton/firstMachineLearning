this is one of those movies  like dave american dreamer and local hero  that holds a viewers interest time and again lightweight movies seldom win oscars but whoever did the casting for soapdish deserves one even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming its still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop true all the drama is melodrama but thats entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg now why cant i write sht like that i think its unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation
