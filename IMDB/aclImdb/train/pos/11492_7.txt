the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia brooke adames  bradley marshall jeff hayenga who have tried for the last five years to conceive virginia has had two miscarriages since then  is desperate to have a child they visit dr richard meyerling james karen for help after he is recommended by some of their friends dr meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child dr meyerling operates on virginia  it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success  virginia is pregnant at first everything seems perfect  the marshalls couldnt be happier but their picture perfect lives dont last for long as virginias pregnancy develops problems she becomes moody  acts totally out of character  she receives a worrying phone call from beth jane cameron another woman who has undergone dr meyerlings procedure who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends  is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of herbr br produced  directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horrorthriller its definitely not a scifi film as the imdb would have you believe that pleasantly surprised me the script by henry dominic tries to be different  it must take some credit for that at least the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares  bad special effects its got quite a clever story that works  plays on basic human fears it moves along at a fair pace although its not exactly an action packed film by any means the climax was good  seemed a fitting way to round things off  the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then maybe flender knew something the rest of us didnt on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements  is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times also i have to mention it what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about ehbr br director flender does an ok job the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but its good enough the atmosphere is good  theres a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her  dr meyerlings sinister plans arent fully revealed until the last possible moment disappointingly the blood  gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt ill remember too much about itbr br technically the film is ok id imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but its well made even if its a little bland  forgettable the baby creature is actually a decent special effect  has fairly realistic facial movement the acting is good  this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends 1994  2004 star lisa kudrow i have to be honest i dont like friends  i dont even know who she was in this so i cant tell you how she didbr br the unborn is a good horrorthriller that deserves to be more widely known  seen its far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves if your a horror fan  are looking for something a bit different something slightly more intelligent  thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii 1994 which i watched straight after this check my review out if you want
