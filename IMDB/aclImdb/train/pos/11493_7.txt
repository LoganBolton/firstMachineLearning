the unborn is a pretty good lowbudget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy its very well acted by the alwaysgood brooke adams and bmovie stalwart james karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a bgrader the music by gary numan of all people is good too henry dominics script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it rodman fenders direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares if youre a fan of adams whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out shes great as always
