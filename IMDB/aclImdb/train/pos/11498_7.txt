kolchak the night stalker is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy sarcastic fortysomething reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural and occasionally extraterrestrial forces based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character this series died a quick death in the mid1970s due to low ratings but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today but will the average modernday viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead br br thats actually a tough question to answer fairly detractors of this series tend to argue that its formulaic and hopelessly dated on the other hand fans argue that its cleverly written wellacted and sometimes genuinely spooky and me ive got a foot in both camps i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently though i can plainly see that the series has major flawsbr br ill address the question of kolchak being formula fiction first now i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas  just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern for example repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself in fact critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and actively seek out repetitive entertainment however the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid  its too repetitive even by the most generous standardsbr br in almost every episode kolchak investigates a murder and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster he tries to publish a story about said monster but his editor vincenzo blocks him always on the grounds that kolchak doesnt have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work and alas kolchak is also obstructed by the police so in the end kolchak does some independent research on the monster figures out how to kill it and then kills it without ceremony or reward or writing a big story about itbr br you can see where this eversostrict formula might get tiresome right im particularly mystified by vincenzo  if kolchaks always raving about monsters and vincenzo never believes it well then why doesnt vincenzo fire kolchak or have him committed thats what any normal boss would do but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists as a result many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable  though they are also quite funnybr br the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula however usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist these select episodes are good enough that i think theyre largely immune to typical criticisms of the series some of my favorites include br br horror in the heights  an episode thats noteworthy for being grimy inventive and socially aware kolchaks dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula the script written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster is remarkably literate and it delves deeply into the monsters backstorybr br the devils platform  a possible inspiration for the omen films this episode stands out to me because the villain  a very young tom skerritt  tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies and in so doing reveals a lot about the reporters character br br firefall  this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans but i enjoyed it because its got a great red herring and a really creepy almost unstoppableseeming monsterbr br though ive singled out these three episodes for praise id say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least for my money there are only two complete turkeys in the 20episode run primal scream which is about monkeymen running rampant in chicago and the sentry which features the dumbestlooking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan br br on balance then this is a good series a little repetitive a little cheesy perhaps but it has elements of greatness even during the weaker episodes darren mcgavins wonderful performance as the caustic worldweary endlessly funny kolchak truly shines he carries the series effortlessly in a way that for example sarah michelle gellar never managed on buffy mcgavin was one great character actor and this series is worth watching for him alone
