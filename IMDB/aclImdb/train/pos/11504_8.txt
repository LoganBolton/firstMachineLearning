there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written seminal tv show the godfather to xfiles and buffy etc as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid or as a wellwrittenacted gumshoefilmnoir it works on both levels the scariness may have been diluted over the years it was made in the mid70s but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak an eccentric tenacious rumpled newsmanmonsterhunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of kolchaks overstressed putupon boss tony vincenzoplayed with tremendous worldweariness by the also late great simon oakland you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like star treks spock and mccoy only more acidic over the course of two pilot tv movies and a oneseason series kolchack fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies government conspiracies aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire 9 yr run of the xfiles in one season and kolchak did it first and as for composer gil melles cool partlywhistled main title music well xfiles creator chris carter calls mike snows very similar xfiles main title theme an homage both themes work well leave it at that and unlike many modern horrorscifi shows most of kolchaks monsters are shown in shadow and in quick cutseffectively and sometimes thankfully as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny but some still do modern horror shows take note less is more one of the few flaws of the show and its a small one is the overuse of sunny california locales passing for windy city chicago night gallery had the same issue unavoidable for a modestbudget la based show and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are now viewed as clichés the effeminate reporter ron updike always used for comic relief sweet old ladyadvice columnist emily but they all do have their moments to shine unlike many supporting tv characters since cliché or not kolchak is a timeless show that serves as a template for many that followed and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show agent mulders real dad and as a footnote i tried watching a few episodes of the new reimagining of the show its an xfiles clone a copy of a copy and a bad one at that carl kolchak is now a modelpretty angsty 30something played dismally by a boring stuart townsend and giving him a scullytype partner is also a lame idea it undermines kolchak as a lone don quixote crusader and kolchak and vincenzo getting along wheres the tension the interplay that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake take a beloved cult series scrape off everything unique about it drain it of all character and color but keep the name need that cult cred and voilà instant rehash it gets an f in reimaginings 101 this new version deserved the axe stick with the shortlived but classic original it truly gets better with age
