its a genuine shame that this spinoff tv series inspired by the superior madefortv pictures the night stalker and the night strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl kolchaks spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and longsuffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the sentry and horror in the heights plus you cant go wrong with such triedntrue fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn john fiedler john dehner severn darden and william daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewerset climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest smalltime chicago illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchakbr br kolchak was the quintessential 70s everyman protagonist a wily and quickwitted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon oakland was perfect as carls chronically illtempered boss tony vincenzo jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster makeup and special effects the titular lycanthrope in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in chopper cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in the youth killer but even the secondrate shows are redeemed by the programs trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavins boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence
