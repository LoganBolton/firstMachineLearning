warning possible spoilers but not really  keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i wont have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and noone else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1  2 plus teri hatcher from tvs supermanbr br every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an oldfashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the shows perennial awardwinning lead nicknamed americas sweetheart the daytime emmieslike awards opening does introduce us to celestes show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because its always such a genuine thrill adam did you watch i won well nguh the reason for adams absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and were instantly off on a trip with celestes neuroses she cries screeches and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee kathy najimi constantly waddling after celeste unseen through celestes fog of paranoia indulges a taste for tammy faye baker for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hiredbr br rosie schwartz whoopi goldberg has seen it all before she is the head writer of the show and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years so when celeste freaks rosie offers to write her off the show for six months well just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama but celeste has doubts i thought that the dalai lama moved to la well then some other lama fernando lamas come on such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas son of aforementioned fernando lamas d 1982br br those who can remember the economics teacher ben stein in ferris buellers day off 1986 as he deadeningly calls the roll bueller bueller bueller will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall in real life mr happy days and brother of penny who gets paid 12 million to make the command decisions on the sun also sets  he says he definitely likes peppy and cheap and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon whos a bitchbr br geoffrey anderson kevin kline is the yummywithaspoon and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes robert downey jr and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character rod randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago somehow they work out the logical difficulties and geoffrey anderson steps off the choochoobr br celeste can now only get worse and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps first her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara but she soon degenerates into a stalker unfortunately she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily geoffreys been promised development of his oneman play about hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise im not going back to florida nohow argues geoffrey you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf  and indeed seeing geoffreys dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as mr loman he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven the shows new ingenue so hes not leavingbr br beautiful elizabeth shue as laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well but of course the course to true love never did run smoothly montana moorehead cathy moriarty is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicitybr br will her plots finally succeed will celeste settle her nerves or will she kill tawnee first will the producer get mr fuzzy youll just have to watch  the second half  of this utterly lovable farcically malicious riotbr br and youll really have to see to believe how the shortsighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter if you are not in stitches with stomachheaving laughter and tears pouring down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental soapdish 1991 is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again because its not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines this is very wellcrafted humor almost all of it in the writing a draw with blazing saddles 1974 for uproarious apoplexy value although otherwise dissimilar watch it and weep a happy source for anyones video addiction 10 out of 10
