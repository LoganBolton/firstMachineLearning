i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13 1974 i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle hey wheres the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level when darren mcgavins carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations he reacts like most people would he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode its rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force hes usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are in one episode he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself hes heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldnt do but that doesnt mean he probably wouldnt much rather someone else did it instead of him hes a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monsterhunter he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesnt want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do if his plan to defeat the creature didnt work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what i would do in the situation thats why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him you were scared for him and for the other characters too the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but its all for naught if you dont care about the characters darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but as an adult i can see why it couldnt go on in that formula for very long i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling determined and brusk but goodhearted reporter for the ins known as carl kolchak i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show its not the monsters darklylit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients the secret to its success is right there in the title  kolchak the night stalker without mcgavins lovable bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just aint a night stalker
