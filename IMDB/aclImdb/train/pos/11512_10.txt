when originally screened in america in 1972 the night stalker became the highest rated madefortv movie in history based on jeff rices unpublished novel it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak  the late darren mcgavin  discovered the existence of a vampire in modernday las vegas when it arrived on british television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning as indeed was i we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen br br i did not know of the existence of the night strangler until it turned up nearly a decade later itv who screened the kolchak movies had apparently decided to pass on the spinoff series they felt barnaby jones starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse kolchak with kojak for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine i could not even purchase the jeff rice novelsbr br then something wonderful happened in 1990 bbc2 put out the show as part of a latenight friday series devoted to the supernatural called mystery train hosted by richard obrian kolchak found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of the brain eaters and earth vsthe spider the opening titles were trimmed removing kolchaks whistling and the closing creditswell there were nonebr br the first episode screened was werewolf i cannot say i was overly impressed but stuck with it and am i glad that i didbr br i really wish id seen it in 1974 my twelve year old self would have adored it creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired chris carters imagination br br the shows biggest asset was of course mcgavin unlike the recent kolchak the original was an everyman figure eccentrically dressed rather conservative he was to the supernatural what columbo was to crime the late simon oakland was great too as kolchaks badtempered boss tony vincenzo the scripts overflowed with wonderful dry wit i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror when the twenty episodes ended i felt bereftbr br the xfiles came along a few years later and filled the void  but only to an extent i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back i am glad that the show was never revived though without oakland it would not have been the samebr br i have the rice books now and have read them several times i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first  in his book danse macabre  as it is as good as anything he has written br br alright so some of the monsters were hardly stateoftheart but so what the new kolchak totally missed the point of the original what you dont see is sometimes more frightening than what you dobr br best episode  horror in the heights worst episode  the sentry
