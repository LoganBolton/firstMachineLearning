im not a john cleese completist although i thought fawlty towers was brilliant but i am a fan and when i saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local blockbuster i decided to give it a try what i got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences ive ever had the writing is typical english goon show schtick in fact as an audio skit this wouldnt be out of place on a firesign theater album but the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates strange case into the kind of jawdropping performance that can create lifelong british comedy fanatics br br the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here cleeses portrayal of holmes seems to owe much to the arkins and sellers inspector clouseau however cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe who plays watson as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film id never heard of lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as im concernedbr br some people might not care for strange case especially if british whimsy isnt their cuppa tea but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it vanished from sight
