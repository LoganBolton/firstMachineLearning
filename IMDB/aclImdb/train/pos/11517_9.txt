if you enjoy cleese  all the british pythonesque humour of the time then this little gem is absolutely hilariousbr br arthur lowe is a real treatbr br i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever i have it on tape and it is continually appreciatedbr br perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriouslybr br i cant believe it is now only available in the us ntsc of course and not in uk where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour
