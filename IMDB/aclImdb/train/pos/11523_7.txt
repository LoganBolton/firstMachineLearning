this is one of the funniest movies i have seen i watched it on dvd and the disc does not have any special features or even a menu but that is not necessarily what i care about br br i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis depending on among other things if it is a big studio production or a smaller film this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things that said i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seenbr br i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin alan arkin has most of the funniest lines the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at lifes decisions as her character does that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humorbr br this is not a movie for children obviously but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity there is quite a bit of adult language though but it can sometimes be very funny in particular alan arkins character who cant even swear correctlybr br also watch for the cameos from known character actors
