well this was one of those films i caught on the offchance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many 80s horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm ie not just another glut of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldnt go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess id give it 65 out of 10
