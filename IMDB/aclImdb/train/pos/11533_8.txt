this movie which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driverless moving vehicle has quite the quirky little personality to boot the cast of seven although one girl doesnt hang around for the bodycount which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is are all superhot as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert an odd but effective choice of setting who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck it predates many of the vehicleinspired slashers to date the trip joy ride jeepers creepers where the killers vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist the killer himself is quite creepy and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire as scanty and stonewashed as it may be director bill crain does some really great things with his camera some neat tricks on screen and the cast tries their absolute best theres enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans and enough ta from a couple of the girls to please ta fans overall this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as its proved quite rare to find on video highly recommended
