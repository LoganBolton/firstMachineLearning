mirage 1990 is a very rare horrorchiller from 1990 released here in the uk on the new world video labelbr br its a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck this film has some creepy scenes and some gore here and there but i have to say that the acting was so lame even by low budget standards but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it and i never fell asleep or turned it off which is always a good sign i nearly gave this movie 610 but seeing as it built up steam along the way had some good moments of gore and suspense had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too ill give it 710
