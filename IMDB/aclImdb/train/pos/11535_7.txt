bill crains rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesnt follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons  a sin thats virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces but theres still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that youve grown to expect just as wally kozs surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down br br it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as im sure youll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that theres certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness gregs older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesnt seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel br br i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i dont even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesnt appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera id have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when its necessary r christopher biggs gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck theres also some black humor thats surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killers boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when hes revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and teds bogus journey i didnt quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadisticallybr br there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and bg steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesnt come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at its freakiestbr br mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately youve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended
