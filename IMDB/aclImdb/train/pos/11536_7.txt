its hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the tv show more but theres a lot to be said for the sourcebr br oscar madison walter matthau is a top new york city sportswriter who lives in an eightroom apartment by himself a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset enter his friend felix ungar jack lemmon needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset the result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a neil simon stage playbr br first things first i love that apartment poker table novelty dart board askew photos of baseball players empty booze and beer containers even a pair of roman columns its a place where men can be boys simon and director gene saks do a great job opening up the stage plays single set oscars living room by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between oscar and felix more corners to bounce off ofbr br neal heftis familiar score was heard on the tv show but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here in several different arrangements that make the onscreen action soar whenever its played real location work and night shots of manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time buddwing the world of henry orient midnight cowboy manchurian candidate rosemarys baby etcbr br are lemmon and matthau too heavy in comparison to tony randall and jack klugman to be fair the movie is meant to be a more serious affair dealing with the thenuncommon condition of midlife divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work simon has more in mind than entering felix and oscar in a game of password or a battle of wits with howard cosell but i dont knowbr br both lemmon and matthau were terrific comedians i enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as i often do in their separate movies but i never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team here in their bestregarded partnership they seem to be acting in two different films lemmon in a comedydrama and matthau in a farce matthau is great in the beginning charming us with his teddybear demeanor around the poker table but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like jack torrances in the shining reacting to felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blamebr br while the ending bothers me the part many see as the most jarring the beginning works fine as i see it watching felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isnt great comedy no but its a good way to get into a great comedy setting us up with some reallife pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city in the middle of the movie this scene would have been a miscalculation but it works as a way of establishing felixs torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see oscar and his poker friends bicker and feudbr br thats where simons lines are so great they are the underlying strength of the film he gets the banter exactly right and real and still makes it funny i dont mind you talking felix you got things to say whats scaring me is im beginning to listen the tv show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better in fact the tv show once made a good point about assuming anything at all but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right
