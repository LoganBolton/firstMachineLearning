neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couplea mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartmentbr br lemmon is neatnik felix ungar bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison matthau with somewhat disastrous results seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the others ways with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact oppositebr br funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date the priceless interaction between lemmon matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters a pair of geese in disneys the aristocats and heretheir comic timing on top of lemmons sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilaritywhere it remains much of the timebr br if youre a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work this one is not to be missed matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and of course its easy to see why it became a toprated tv show later onbr br summing up top simon comedy not to be missed
