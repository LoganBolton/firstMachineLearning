this has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the daytime awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actors jealous costars and producer under phony smiles now that is only in the first few minutes then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way this was the first time id seen the always charming teri hatcher while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives she herself is always watchable  same goes for lois  clark not a huge follower but if i run across an episode id watch it robert downey jr does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic david seaton barnes the producer whod give his right eye to see sally fields celeste talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriartys montana mooreheadbr br moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else shes appeared here all she has to do is scream i hate you i hate you you creep or give one of her anticelestecoconspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles yes cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70mmsized lifetime tragedy of the week movies and were all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you cant believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screenbr br how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher if only for a glorified cameo she doesnt realize what a presence she bears on screen she takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herselfbr br how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this at the time she wasnt really known for much adventures in babysitting was kind of cute yes i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price but she didnt hold my attention   much but here she makes the most of her character  stars niece who falls in love with the stars excostarandlover who of course turns out to be the nieces father and the star turns out to be the poor girls motherbr br ill stop there  i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela if youve seen it then reminisce if you havent youve missed a real classic but not really the dvds are made of a material thatll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell
