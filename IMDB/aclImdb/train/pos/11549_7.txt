theres nothing really to dislike about the odd couple and its no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team but theres something so underdeveloped about neil simons adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a fullbodied film i have not seen the play but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful since simon wrote it so the defects cannot be blamed on a stagetoscreen adaptation there are some interesting ideas in this storytwo recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differentlythat simon never fully fleshes out still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours
