heres another film that doesnt really need much of a recommendation its a classic comedy very funny and entertaining and which of course ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better i enjoy both personally br br for some its hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman or perhaps vice versa but what weve got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own its neil simons humorous material thats key and where the laughs really originate frombr br for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple its the story of a neurotic and fussy neatfreak lemmon who is thrown out of a 12year marriage by his longsuffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy matthau pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments
