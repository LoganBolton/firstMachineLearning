i dont think ive really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer hes certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent costar jack lemmon and i suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene saks the odd couple 1968 adapted from a popular neil simon play the realisation suddenly clicked matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own at the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of course pitchperfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone togetherbr br calling to mind billy wilders screenplay for the apartment 1960 this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise compulsive housecleaner felix unger lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window dejected he arrives at the house of good friend oscar matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friends finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantlynagging wife and oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than hes supposed to this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with felixs exwife who remains unseenbr br the odd couple is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart for all their arguing its obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing oscar how tops he his the pairs four poker buddies john fiedler herb edelman david sheiner and larry haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you cant deny that theyve got the best of intentions their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasnt quite the correct solution to felixs gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by wilders the seven year itch 1955 this film doesnt simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement
