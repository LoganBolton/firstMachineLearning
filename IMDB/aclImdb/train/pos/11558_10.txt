the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious felixbut theyre underselling the film without knowing it this isnt just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy its a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce its also damn funny from start to finish but its the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides matthaus bulldog face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile
