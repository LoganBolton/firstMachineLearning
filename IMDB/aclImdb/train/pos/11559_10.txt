the odd couple is a comic gem one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid  exceeded only by strangelove spinal tap and lebowski lemmon and matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy irresponsible oscar oscars wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude felixs wife leaves him at the start of the movie and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar thats when the fun beginsbr br the entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant oneliners you are probably already familiar with the fu joke but it still works brilliantly due to matthaus comic timingbr br my favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element this one requires repeat viewings
