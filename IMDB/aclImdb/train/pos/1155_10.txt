its very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline its a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vegas i dont like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because its so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion its the best film of 1991
