i simply cant get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is its like the movie doesnt even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these twobr br lemmon had already been in several wellknown films like mr roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie another billy wilder film also with lemmon that particular movie wasnt as great as this one because the story couldnt sustain such a long running time i think it was almost 2 hours however this goes by at a brisk hour and a half even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at matthaus apartment is a tad long so was this sentence thats a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous timebr br i have already written a comment about how the followup to this film sucked and i wont go deeper into that the reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldnt even get a well i never out of the most prudish person out there it is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didnt work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite a few fwords and that just doesnt fit thembr br of course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this i think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john fiedler edelman died recently so there you have it simply one of the best comedies and films everbr br add i have just learned recently that john fiedler has died so to all the fans of him i am deeply sorry i didnt mean any disrespect and i will try to be more careful of what i am blah blah blahing next time
