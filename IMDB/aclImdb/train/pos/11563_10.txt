i saw this many years after the television series and initially i didnt care for it then as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time i watched again and found it absolutely hilarious based on the stage play by neil simon it has not been opened out much for the big screen and thats one of its strengths walter matthau and jack lemmon are brilliant as oscar and felix and the supporting cast are wonderful particularly john fielder as vinnie even now certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter  felix interrupting oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request oscar cracking up and chasing felix around the apartment the giggling pigeon sisters brought low by felixs sob stories and of course the legendary cafeteria scene  later ripped off by nora ephrons when harry met sally  razorsharp dialogue too when the boys think felix has taken an overdose oscar says they could be vitamins he could be the healthiest one in the room fantastic
