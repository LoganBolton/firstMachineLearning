bob clampetts an itch in time milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise elmer fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching the cartoon switches between the fleas progress inside the dogs fur and the dogs desperate attempts to cope with it in a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that cant be scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid it sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only clampett could there are several other elements which make an itch in time pure clampett theres the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dogs flesh theres the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat most notably theres the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dogs behind which causes the flea to wolfwhistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor he momentarily breaks off to address the audience hey i better cut this out i may get to like it with a very limited concept clampett manages to make an itch in time a unique minutiaebased cartoon like an early episode of seinfeld an itch in time is practically about nothing but very funny with it
