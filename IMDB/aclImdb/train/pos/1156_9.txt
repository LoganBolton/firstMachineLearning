years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it its a marvelous spoof of soaps with jealousies the usual actors insecurities and all sorts of lovely excesses but more than anything  an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those topnotch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but its marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes ill throw it on while doing housecleaning and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many congrats to all who made it
