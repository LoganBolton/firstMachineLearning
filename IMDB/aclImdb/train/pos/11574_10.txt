this movie is a halfdocumentaryand it is pretty interestingbr br this is a good moviebased on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germanybr br this movie isnt perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselvesbr br if youre interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie thats worth a look
