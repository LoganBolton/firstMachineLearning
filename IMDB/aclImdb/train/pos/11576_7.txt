it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like sh√¥ kasugi christopher lee and johnrhys davies it really is the perfect badventure of all time its actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cant hate it i think its an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song
