this is one of the best comedy ever  the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and youll understand why it is so great if youre a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you dont laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor
