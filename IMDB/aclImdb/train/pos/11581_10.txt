it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings by using the adjective shocking i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off either with or without a reasonbr br the first part of the film focuses on hannas successful participation in the hungarian resistance maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance due to inconsistent directing but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy her very beautiful looks help of course but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress playing a good partbr br certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hannas war i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan often despised for the gianni versace murder was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene on the other hand i am very thankful he made this impressive and thoughtprovoking film and as i am very positive about it i think he did a good jobbr br the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one it focuses on hannas suffering beware of donald pleasences scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war i receive hannas war especially the second half as a strong antiwar film and for that alone golan deserves credit it is also this second half in which maruschka detmers talent comes out creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking strong and tragic ever portrayed it is also great to see ellen burstyn whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider who had she been alive and cast would have made a similar effective contribution to hannas warbr br the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears and when i realized once more it wasnt even fiction it all actually happened i found myself in even more tears the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever
