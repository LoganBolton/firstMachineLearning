someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschys fury of the wolfman to the great spanish surrealist films lage dor and un chien andelou the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end dali and bunuel probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull offbr br the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c some mishmash about a professor walterman  his first name mind you  who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasnt been the same since which is understandable one of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beastbr br walterman flips out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is electrocuted dies is buried unburied taken to a castle filled with circus freaks wired to various machines zapped with assorted electronic effects injected with potent elixirs is chained up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening gown with thighhigh nazi fetish boots whips him he escapes helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe eventually turns back into a werewolf and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter who did nothing look what a beautiful day it is br br la furia del hombre lobo was written by paul naschy in a hurry original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by josé maría zabalza a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production he was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschys previous movies mark of the wolfman the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie post production was a nightmare nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a prerelease screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curbbr br yet somehow the film works if you let it it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles vaulted catacombs chains whips gloomy moors fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesnt make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and hes howling at the full moon then its raining again and yet you dont look at it as a gaffe its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible opposites are the same and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts sparking with electricity people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness  i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend it is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does its easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it the trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effectbr br paul naschy died last week at the age of 75 he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in madrid spain with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment his rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the wolfman in rapt awe even people who dont like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots you can find it for free at archiveorg or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel its worth far far morebr br amusingly naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but i will say this id rather watch fury of the wolfman in its dingiest most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekendbr br the world lost a great artist this month watch his films and rememberbr br 910
