in the seemingly endless quest to find well made well acted horror films it is alltoorare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark needless to say i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across burned at the stake on a us cable network while i was flipping channels the premise is reasonably simple in 1692 young ann putnam swift is the most vocal witness against alleged witches leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure manipulating her for his own ends is reverend parris peters who also serves as the courts guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and satanism things get complicated when ann starts accusing members of the goode family of witchcraft salem of 1980 or so loreen graham also played by swift begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the salem witch museum a strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building he continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more soon it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann putnam unfortunately further description gets rather involved and would give too much away though the film is not actionoriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the films many flashbacks sounds very convincing the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects in a sidenote the films technical advisor was laurie cabot salems official witch viewers who appreciate a wellmade atmospheric but understated horror film may appreciate this the writerdirector bert i gordon has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and similar works years earlier
