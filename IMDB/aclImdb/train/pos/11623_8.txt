youll know what i mean after youve seen red eye br br overall red eye was a betterthanexpected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over its a thumper br br its hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a runofthemill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lotbr br other factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant 8 out of 10 more like a 75 but thats pretty good
