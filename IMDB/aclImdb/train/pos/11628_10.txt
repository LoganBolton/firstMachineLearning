i didnt want this to get complicated leese i have to assume shes gonna read that fear takes flight at 30000 feet in this taut action thriller an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa  rachel mcadams realizes her seatmate  cillian murphy is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot as the minutes tick by shes in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to latebr br one of the many reasons i love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars mcadams and murphy who are also two of my top favorite actors for example the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy two people keep running into each other i got to hand it to the two as well for making a film like this work especially murphys character jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent yet hes trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally i mean in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisabr br a great thrill ride all the way through a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about but actually i wouldnt mind a prequel to this one which would take place with jackson surveilling lisa favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene because it was so unexpected there was also that nice buildup to the famous pen scene when is she going to make her move there was also that nice change in mcadams lisa where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court how great was murphy with his whole weezing
