red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night intense acting great villain and unexpected actionbr br some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 mins and 88 of the movie is on a plane and just talking dont worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialogbr br a pg13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thrillerbr br this movies strongest point is its cast this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills if they didnt have those actors the film would have been lost and boring we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later rounding off this cast is brian cox from xmen 2br br the pacing in this film was great just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you luckily this isnt a long movie and doesnt feel like it either much better then the other flight movie flight planbr br here is my flight plan comment httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0408790usercomments578br br i recommend not too long and not too shabbybr br 810
