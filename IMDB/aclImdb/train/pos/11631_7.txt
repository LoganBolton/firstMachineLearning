red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert rachel mcadams is about to catch the last red eye flight back to miami where she lives  works while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome  charming jackson rippner cillian murphy  they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other once the plane takes off  they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is  that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe jack scalia  they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel  make it happen or her father will be killedbr br directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left 1972 a nightmare on elm street 1984 the serpent and the rainbow 1989 the people under the stairs 1991  the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short punchy fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed at only 85 odd minutes in length its a very quick moving economical  straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots some may like this approach like i did while others may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick  fast without the film slowing down any  giving you a chance to relax i really liked the plot for red eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell its a film made to entertain  for me thats what it did i really liked the two central characters lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper is a suitably slimy villain with a cold im only doing my job type mentality another plus point is that i didnt think anyone behaved overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings  the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion i really liked this  its one of cravens better more recent filmsbr br craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught  fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action  a gripping plot he certainly doesnt hang about  once he starts the action  tension he never lets up far  away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane  once the film switches to miami  lisas fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but its still good a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it  looks drop dead stunning those who see wes cravens name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since theres no horror in it at all despite the imdb listing horror as red eyes genre i am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some waybr br dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of 44000000 but reduced it to 25000000 although its still a very well made film with glossy production values actually shot in los angeles  florida in california the film was supposedly written with husband  wife sean penn  robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy  is a total babe in this  worth watching the film for on her own oh  she puts in a decent performance toobr br red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely i didnt think i would enjoy it as much as i did  i am glad i decided to watch it this definitely gets a recommendation from me  rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this
