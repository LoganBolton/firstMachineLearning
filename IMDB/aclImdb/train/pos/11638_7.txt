i had fun watching red eye its not a masterpiece but its well directed and structured cillian murphy and rachel mcadams are perfect in the role yes its the same old story with a different setting but wes craven gave it a good pace at least not another scream with the usual college killer its nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesnt stand out as its main character particularly from a filmmaker like craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good tv movie had it not been released theatrically good job
