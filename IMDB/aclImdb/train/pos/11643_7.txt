i find i enjoy this show but the format needs some work first off the good attributes i like how this show will take us through the daytoday life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad theyve allowed their lives to become this is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome intervention doesnt candycoat things and sometimes the outcome often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing is a negative outcome this makes the positive outcomes all the betterbr br another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and dont have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable its actually superior to scripted shows like the shield where the photography is so bad it can induce nauseabr br now for the bad an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show youll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly youre thrown into the story of another get caught up in that story then suddenly youre back to the first addictor are you by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to this constant flipflopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions i once heard the marketing bs reason for this poor design the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what theyre watching oh please clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that arent big enough for an hour show so they mix two together by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block like they should it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing and the commercials if they are interested in one case but not the otherbr br i used to find these blender episodes so annoying that id only tell my tivo to record episodes containing one addict but then it became easier just to record all of them
