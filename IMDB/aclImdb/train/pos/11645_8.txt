i was on france around march 05 and i love to go to this film festivals i knew about this cinémas damérique latine de toulouse but ive never went to it i decided to go and then i caught cero y van 4 br br the film is stunning it doesnt caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was frenchsubtitled but its still shockingbr br this film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis secuestro express with a stunning mia maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kinda connection with cero y van 4 a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is like the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that theres no security on the streets anymore stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances cero y van 4 is a film that you wont forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned
