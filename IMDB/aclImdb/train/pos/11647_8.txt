i can give you four reasons to see this moviebr br 1 four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary mexican cinemabr br 2 four good stories related into a big schemebr br 3 a surprisingly good castbr br 4 a bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country and many othersbr br possible spoilersbr br alejandro gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts br br then antonio serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the italian neorealism with a peter and the wolflike anecdotebr br in the third story the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context carlos carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment but after the recent lynching at tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico this story couldnt be more updatedbr br and at the end fernando sariñana returns to the dark humor in the grand finale in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed reprising the center scene from one of his previous films todo el poder sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme and by the way give us the scene that steals the movie with anna ciochetti making a brief stripteasebr br once the movie has ended you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie and maybe enjoyed it with a very painful subject they say that in mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example this film is a testimony of how mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime stateand perhaps accepted it between two fires the criminals and the socalled authorities full of corruption even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they dont get this unhurt if you had an assault without a scratch then youre lucky meanwhile dont lose the chance to see this movie highly recommendedbr br and its a beautiful life in mexico
