what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you wont regret it its too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it
