when friendship kills in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic anytime lexi katie wright or jennifer marley shelton threw up i wanted to vomit myself its kind of hard to explain why if you ask me they should have been more cooperative about things however i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents before i wrap this up id like to say if you ask me when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a persons body  now in conclusion i recommend this movie to everyone who hasnt seen it youre in for some tears and a good time so the next time its on tv kick back with a friend and watch it
