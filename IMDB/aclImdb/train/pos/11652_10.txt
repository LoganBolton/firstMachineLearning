i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldnt buy a copy for my friendbr br its a touching story about how people with eating disorders dont necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
