i agree with the above comment i love the realism in this and in many movies not just movies on eating disorders the producers seem to forget that they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again which i dislike because its not reality not meaning to say things cant get better and not meaning to say things dont in this movie but it doesnt spend most of the movie creating all these problems and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again when people have eating disorders people dont just admit it and want to get better and then life is peachy it takes time and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters we go through the difficulties with them getting better and worse because it is a very important part of the movie it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way and i loved that i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders it is scary to see how people react when they find out especially if they approve of it i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told and defiantly one of my favourites
