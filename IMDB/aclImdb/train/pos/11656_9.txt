i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesnt automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that ive seen that getting better doesnt just happen its hard work and takes time its a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this
