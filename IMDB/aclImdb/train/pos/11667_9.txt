the secret of kells is a film ive been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny im here to tell you now its been worth the wait the cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as id feared the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination i particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page the characterisation is superb i love brendan gleesons voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling the forest is a triumph such a beautiful place the story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book im a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people i know whove seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that its a lovely little film i will definitely buy the dvd when its released and would like to say well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project may there be many more  coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas everyone loves it and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars such a joy to see this nominated
