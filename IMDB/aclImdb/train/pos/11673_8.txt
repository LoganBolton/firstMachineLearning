having seen charley boorman in long way round with ewan mcgregor i was very interested to see how charley would be in his own show i thought charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness it just shows their human too i dont know a lot about bikes but this show gripped me right from the start the preparation and organising for this event seems immense the event itself seems very dangerous and im fascinated to see why charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music i cant believe he broke his collar bone i really hope its not the end i cant wait to see the next episode
