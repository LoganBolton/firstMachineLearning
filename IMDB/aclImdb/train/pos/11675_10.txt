i always follow the dakar so when my husband bought charlies race to dakar dvd home i couldnt wait to watch it of course wed seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on but that never gives the background and specific teamsbr br if you watched long way round then you wont be surprised by the language which frankly i find more amusing than offensivebr br i think the only thing that annoyed me about the dvd was charlies hair but he had it styled before dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged tho i could have lived without the flame undies lol as with lwr the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself i nearly cried when charlie broke his hand and winced at every bruise he sustained while trainingand of course the death of andy caldicottthat was an appalling tragedy but then every year theres somethingbr br russ drives me nuts although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in lwr its great to see him get along so well now with charliebr br what i learned from this odyssey was  1 never let scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything  they had months to prepare the x5 and still the day before the team left for lisbon scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race 2 the dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their riderdriver retrieval plan  leaving matt and presumably a large number of other ridersdrivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence 3 charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for rough and tough adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as hed like and finally 4 charlie and ewan are planning another of these epos called the long way down in 2007 and i cant wait to get my hands on it d if you love bikes andor genuinely nice blokes having a go you have to watch this i guarantee you love it its very entertainingbr br in conclusion to simon pavey  you sir are a hero i was so impressed by the your quiet achiever manner and the fact that you actually finishedjust incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is and to charlie matt and the rest of the team  full marks for pulling it off to think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable youre all wonderful
