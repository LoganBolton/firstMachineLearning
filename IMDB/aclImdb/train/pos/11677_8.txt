i loved long way round and wasnt even aware of race to dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket i bought it and after a slightly hmm will this be as good first episode i decided that it was charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew great to see him with ewan again there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didnt bother me as for their being no mention of it on the package thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have they should have given it a 15 just for the language alonebr br highly recommended series i want more
