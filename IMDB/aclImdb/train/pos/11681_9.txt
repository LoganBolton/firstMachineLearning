many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the storyline was rather typical of claras later silents i still find it somewhat heartstirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happygolucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she lovesnever mind that this man is married claras lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant storyline quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of claras ability to make the audience laugh
