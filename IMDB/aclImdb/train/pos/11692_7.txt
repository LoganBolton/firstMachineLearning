im not saying that just as a chris rock fan im saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was its everythingworksout ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was subpar with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a headsup scenario watch heaven can wait instead its better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie youll enjoy out he has some good standup in this moviebr br overall 7 out of 10
