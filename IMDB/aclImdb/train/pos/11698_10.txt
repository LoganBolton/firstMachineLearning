i would say for its time this movie was awesomeand yes if you have no desire to become a christian then why bother watching it i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind seriesthey run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people i think in order to actually judge this movie you should see itthere are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistakendont use our comments to judge see the movie for yourself god will bless you if that is why you are watching them
