i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and its awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of whos going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it whats even happened to patty dunning now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s but we havent heard from her since i know for sure about thom rachford who plays jerry works for accounting at rd films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school
