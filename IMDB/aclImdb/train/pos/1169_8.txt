stylish moody innovative revengedriven bloodbath also cheesy of course and sporadically very cheesy it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event and the girl comes around to the good guys side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy its sad theres no gloria grahame but so fantastic that its alain delon and not glenn ford could there be anyone as beautiful as alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat yet hes totally tough and icy cool no one nowadays can touch himthough someone like jude law could try i guess hard for any girl to look good with him the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases and those arent generally my cup of teaespecially one willy nilly one in the woods people also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion for instance in a junkyard cruncher but beyond the cheese the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off more creativity excitement and freshness in that forgotten movie than most of what ive seen lately
