a thief in the night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers i have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting god they just needed to find an excuse and blamed a thief in the night do not listen these movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation but theyre also fun to watch in their simplicity they are in fact lowbudget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing i had no clue because i really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70s included lowbudgets all the timebr br a thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical patty myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about at first the movie isnt all based around her until the rapture happens what it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves no one can ever blame themselves because theyre always rightbr br just like these whiners who complain about the movie these people must be full grown adults im thirteen and you dont see me whining especially since i was exactly like patty before i reaccepted christ into my heart for those who havent seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a christian movie instead of stereotypical everyone else is wrong movies than youll enjoy a thief in the night dont knock it before you try it something new is always good trust your own instincts
