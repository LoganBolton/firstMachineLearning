a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal eventbr br i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian moviebr br the production values hey its an independent movie with a shoestring budget so ya its going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is alist hollywood fare but properly compared with other independent movies this film is perfectly acceptable more important than acting style costumes and music is the narrative itself is the story compelling do the dramatic moments work does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax the answer to all these questions is an unqualified yes as a sidenote the truly important technical stuffcontinuity sound lightingare fine the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanshipbr br content value the message of the movie is superb when you consider how many ideas the moviemaker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes you begin to appreciate his artistry he presents the message of salvation the consequence of unbelief the danger of backsliding the truth of the rapture and the threat of a worlddominating satanic government with flare imagination andmost importantly for an evangelical moviewith biblical accuracybr br the moviemaker is a good storyteller for example he develops the message of salvation in two important ways 1 he shows us through action the reality of jesus christs sacrifice for our sake this is achieved in a subplot where the zookeeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snakepoison the poison is like sin the cure is like christs blood shed on the cross 2 the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ so the moviemaker uses both action and dialog to tell his storybr br as a sidenote the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation couched in explicitly evangelical christian language imagery and theology is also perfectly acceptable to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd its akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sportwear what else would evangelical christian movie makers make if not a film that states their case also the fact that the moviemaker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is again perfectly acceptable the moviemaker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably how do i know i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 it still lived in her memory thirty years later how many movies can you say that about all around a very enjoyable thoughtprovoking show i plan on showing it to my teen group at church
