now for all of the cinematographical buffs out there this film may not rank high on your list of things to see but if you know anything about plot development profound truth and the intentions that this film the series had youd understand my povbr br granted the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end but the film is biblically accurate and justifiably scares viewers into thinking about what may be im a christian not due to this movie but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my savior the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions its not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god but rather a means to get your attentionbr br as a christian i know ill not be left behind and thanks to movies like this i can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment acting and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer this is a movie you shouldnt not only see but feel with your heart and soul
