ms patty dukes story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles i saw myself acting out just like her i was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as childrenbr br i saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and i have loved this movie so much anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for that is not the issue here the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame ms duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hopebr br unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they dont know the hell they have to live with the movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts it was so realso so real it was like watching myself up there on screenbr br i wish i could thank ms patty duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness bocka
