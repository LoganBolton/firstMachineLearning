this is such a great movie call me anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her for patty duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease i have a lot of respect for her as a person the only thing i dont like is i cant get it on tape ive tried looking for it but with no success any one know how to get it
