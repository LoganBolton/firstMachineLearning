this is a cute little horror spoofcomedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sitcom never made it past the pilot stage due to its sexual references this film however is very amusing elvira is the modernday chesty morgan and the queen of the oneliners this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elviras haunted hills which was meant to be a takeoff of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on its face watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience
