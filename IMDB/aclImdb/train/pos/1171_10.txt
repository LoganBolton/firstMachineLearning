i found this episode to be one of funniest ive seen in a long time the south park creators have done the best spoof of a romero film i have ever seenthey have truly touched on romeros underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films i would love to know what george romeros opinion was on this episode im sure it was purely positive keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact most spoofs deal with the pure gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films i think that if a zombie outbreak did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode
