i wasnt expecting much and to be honest i didnt like this film the first time around but watching it again and i realised that its kinda cool sure its a one joke film but its a funny gag br br someone posted that it could be better written and it could be i think this film had the potential to be a overthetop my cousin vinny but with a horror host instead of a lawyer sadly its a wasted opportunity with just a bit more writing it could be a classic the kids are underused theres no reason why they should latch on to elvira apart from the obvious reasons it would have been great to see their relationship flourish i know its a comedy but its little differences that separate the good films from the brilliantbr br elvira herself is always fun and engaging not to mention flirty every time she smiles you will too its hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming and it really is her charm dont let her looks fool you into thinking that shes some sort of tart well she is but shes a nice one the sort of person youd let look after your kids wouldnt let her cook for them thoughbr br id recommend giving it a go br br just dont expect too muchbr br shes more than just a great set of boobs shes also an incredible pair of legs
