since the start of her career in the 70s and vastly throughout the exuberant 80s elvira cassandra peterson has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror  bad monster movies while ms peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures covering a wide variety in genres it was her tvcharacter elvira that brought her the most fame part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous unlike many other big name actors  actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their early work ive seen only bits  pieces of her tv performances but her cameo role in ghoultowns recent tribute song mistress of the dark really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video over the years elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid80s came aroundbr br and in 1988 after films like fright night and terrorvision incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tvwork it finally happened elvira mistress of the dark the motion picture now i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film a few years ago i did manage to watch elviras haunted hills made in 2001 but for some reason it didnt impress me all that much was it really that forgettable or should i give it another watch i actually really do feel like rewatching it now as this first elvira film from 88 really convinced me though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script there really is no way to deny it cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy she also cowrote the screenplaybr br when elvira learns shes one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt she never heard of before she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas out to claim her rightfully inherited money she travels to a quiet new england town but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her often unintentionally provocative behaviour to make things worse her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected a rundown mansion a cookbook and a poodle but what she doesnt know and her evil uncle vincent albot does is that her great aunt was a witch and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable and if you havent turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipebook then rest assured youre going to sit out this ride with a smile on your facebr br its surprising how a script rigged together with boobjokes witty oneliners movie references inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story simple of course but coherent while other movies heavily relying on gaglike situations often make you loose track of the story completely like the naked gun films for example this film doesnt a lot of horrorcomedies were being produced during the 80s but not a lot of them actually worked let alone a horrorspoof that doesnt derail at some point killer party although im grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale or becomes too tedious too quickly saturday the 14th although elvira is more comedy than horror it doesnt loose track of what its doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot including a real honesttogod witch hunt and elviras very own burnatthestake momentbr br im telling you theres no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already when daniel greenes name appeared daniel who oh yes i recognized his name and later on his dimwitted machoface how can one not forget daniel greene once youve seen atomic cyborg aka fists of steel but if you havent seen atomic cyborg then im sorry but you wont be able to laugh with his face in this one and on a sidenote i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better
