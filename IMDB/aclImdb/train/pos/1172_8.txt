and yet another run of south park comes to an end this wasnt as strong an episode as id hoped for but night of the living homeless was a stronger finisher then stanleys cup tsst bloody mary or erection day it still cant hold a candle to woodland critter christmas and goobacks but few episodes canbr br night of the living homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre done in a way only south park would think of instead of flesh eating zombies the entities are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of itbr br randy and other residents are locked in the community center though this time on the roof where they can survey the scene a particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone and becomes homeless leaving randy no choice but to shoot himbr br meanwhile the four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired south park is at its best a lot of the times when it is being ridiculous matt and trey played it safe this week and didnt really critique the homeless problem just lampooned itbr br the shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless this is the first time a suicide on south park goes wrong and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies another inspired south park momentbr br overall the episode was funny but it was kept from being great by withholding any real commentary on the homeless and sticking straight with the zombie shtick the ending is somewhat funny but nothing newbr br now we must wait until october for the next batch of episodes its a long haul but south park must be applauded for its run the show seemed to be running out of steam last season but now its back in full form
