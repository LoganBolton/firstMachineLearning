ok i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i dont know why i havent seen it since but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film  again i dont know why but the fact that i remember it speaks volumesbr br comedy is hard  much harder than any drama doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong  is there anything worse than a bad comedy steve martin pay attention you are falling in this category again for some reasonbr br elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly done at a quick pace with tongue in cheek and knowing it isnt the philedelphia story it entertains from start to finish brain donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokesbr br one point of contention  the ending it seems the writersdirector had no idea how to finish a comedy the ending tries to be a love story somewhat undermining the quirky fastpaced dialogue up to that point then there is the tassle scene whereas this has to be seen male opinion it is so over the top and out of place its like a shock one more rewrite for the ending was neededbr br this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail but if you dont try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you youll laugh i guarantee it
