ok this movie is stupid i mean that in a good way thoughit was stupid on purpose and was one of the better stupid movies ive seen the jokes and gags are purposefully bad but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre there is a pretty weak plot but it works just finebr br elviras character is the focus hereshe is lovable and adorablecassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movieon top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly stunning few men could disagree with that the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the moviebr br i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the lastbr br highly recommended to fans of comedy and to fans of beautiful women i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies
