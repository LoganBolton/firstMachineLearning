mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spallbr br while we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spalls range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertorybr br while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brooks script is wellcontained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into actsbr br were introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldnt tell if this is a private or public school as they gather  the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisors role than the martinets she usually has to playbr br a break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but its much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the us over christmasbr br nathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harveys redemption that could have been played for movieoftheweek preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercialsbr br while it is a bit heavyhanded in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than ive seen in most holidaythemed tv movies
