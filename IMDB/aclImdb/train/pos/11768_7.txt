this movie surprised me in a good way from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller even though it was somewhat excitingbr br theres a lot of nice oneliners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci he does a great job the rest of the cast aint halfbad either and especially timothy dalton is a treatbr br the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things if you dont pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked itbr br louis morneau isnt all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the moviebr br made men is well worth checking out
