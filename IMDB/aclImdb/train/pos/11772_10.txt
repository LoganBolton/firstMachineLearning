in another one of bugs bunnys hareraisingly wacky shorts the famous leporid works in a department store display case when owner gildersleeve decides to stuff him of course this proves nearly impossible as bugs apparently knows the store better than gildersleeve and knows when to crossdress as always they keep everything coming at top speed and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted among other things hare conditioned is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the 40s before the termite terrace crowd polished them but dont get me wrong the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrivedbr br anyway this is a great onebr br leporids are rabbits and hares
