i dont quite know how to explain darkend room because to summarize it wouldnt really do it justice its a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the mulholland drive end of the lynchian spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story its hidden on lynchs website and well worth the search
