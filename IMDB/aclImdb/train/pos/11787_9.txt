its a short movie from david lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the lynchian ingredients its mysterious dark inconclusive eerie and strange and before the blond girl starts to talk its even a bit scary the soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because its also sinister and mysterious br br about the setting itself it hasnt the traditional red curtains but it has socking purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of eerinessbr br the plot is about a girl whos locked in a dark room and she cries for help then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying shes there just because of her fault we dont know what did happen or what will happen next it ended unsolved and puzzling as a good lynch movie must end br br its a great short despite some amateurish acting the girls are professional actresses but i think their acting could have been better in this short
