hello this little film is interesting especially for an artist filmmaker or music creator or a visual artist forbr br one can feel and examine davids touchstyle straight out of a short piece of relative simplicitybr br you can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots the pans and the sound elements br br even as simple film this creation is multylayer for example there are some sounds that drone all along while others appear though subtle at certain points to support certain shotsbr br one can see also several types of pans some go up and down in a gentle backforth way there is diagonal pan zooms also go back and forth sometimesbr br the lightning and the compositiondisposition of elements in the space is as usual and obviously work of a painerartist this can be felt even in this crappy room this is to say one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the lookview and composing the scene then comes the forcelines of the visuals like digonales parallels etc the lights degrad√©es and the colours although without too much research for textures as in big productions are fine too this is an artists sketch of a sortbr br all this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the davids touchfeel to it as with any true artist
