i am going to go out on a limb and actually defend shades of grey as a good clipshow episode which delved into the life and death struggle of commander william thomas riker who was battling a terminally fatal diseasebr br the scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as 11001001 angel one and up the long ladder tragic moments were highlighted such as tashas death in skin of evil as well as elements of pulsepounding danger in heart of glory conspiracy and the aforementioned skin of evil riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as an ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake onceafter 3 days of intense pain the snake died this episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of will riker under extreme duress and yes i am biased in my opinion in proclaiming shades of grey as a solid episode because at the time of its original airing my face was covered in sweat wondering whether or not riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great galactic outerspace adventures beyond the final frontierbr br of course in subsequent years i seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episodebut if an award should go for the best clipshow episode in the history of television then i believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect
