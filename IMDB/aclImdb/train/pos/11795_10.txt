i will never forget this film or the events that lead up to jonestown in guyana it just seems so tragic but needs to be told powers boothe give a commanding performance as the leader rev jim jones from obscurity until total madness it would have won him an academy award easily if it was released in the movie theaters it is the kind of miniseries you wont forget you wont forget the images of the cults brutality control and obsessiveness of its leader his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise the mass suicide is horrifying almost unreal to anybodys imagination as to why so many people 900 went willingly or resisted jones orders they dont make mini series like these anymore where were left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others
