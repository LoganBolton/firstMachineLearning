ive seen this film literally over 100 timesits absolutely jampacked with entertainment powers boothe gives a stellar performance as a fan of actors such as william shatner impulse 1974 and ron liebmann up the academy 1981i never thought an actor could capture the intensity like shatner and liebmann in those roles until i saw boothe as jim jones as far as im concerned powers boothe is jim jonesthis film captures his best performance
