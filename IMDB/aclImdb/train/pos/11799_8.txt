a well cast summary of a real event well actually i wasnt there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film communistophobia and parallels to adolf hitler these should be evident to most independent observers anyway boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other wellknown actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable  and i mean it anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal thats why its so terrible  it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place
