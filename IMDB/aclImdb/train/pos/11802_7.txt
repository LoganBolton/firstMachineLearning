this isnt the best bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the scifi channel this is quality stuff it has some action some humor decent fx and bigfoot cg is used but so are some practical fx which i likebr br overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horrorscifi and need a fix its better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it so dont be fooledbr br the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate expect a bit of a lul as the characters are developed but know that things will pick up if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two
