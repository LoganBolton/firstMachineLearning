love it or loathe it its hard to not find warren beattys take on dick tracy the 1990 film adaptation of chester goulds famous comic strip anything short of a genre classic superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years and may soon become a genre all on its ownbr br beattys film liberally uses goulds source material to full effect shooting in all six of the strips primary colors and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of triggerhappy mutant gangsters and loose seductive women a lush visual style and tonebr br it can be stated that the films strong visual aesthetics drastically shortchange the characters and their acting abilities which i dont think can be any further from the truthbr br dick tracy relishes in its look and ghastly characters and beatty himself who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costsbr br other than the visual treats and oscarwinning makeup there is a plot and big boy caprice al pacino deliciously overthetop in an oscarnominated performance seeks to eliminate tracy in one wellplanned move but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under himbr br tracy meanwhile is juggling his relationship with tess trueheart glenne headly who as her name would have it remains faithfully by his side and cares for the kid charlie korsmo who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crimebusting hero tracys fidelity to tess is tested by the tempting advances of breathless mahoney madonna who is also big boys main squeeze at the same time that all of this is going down things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town and decides to play both sides against the middlebr br the performances are good as beattys focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role thats truly standout from the restbr br dick tracy is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre i think that if chester gould was still alive he would be proud of warren beattys take on his beloved crimefighting detectivebr br 810
