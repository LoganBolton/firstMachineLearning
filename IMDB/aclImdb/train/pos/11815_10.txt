at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15000 votes it has a 58 rating something is wrong with that picture personally i give it a 10 i can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is it is a movie based on a comic book hero this movie won more than its share of awards won 3 oscars another 5 wins  26 nominations  right there tells me its better than a 58 some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come if youre looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times al pacino is great as big boy caprice
