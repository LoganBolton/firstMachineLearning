that was great fun i never read those chestergouldcomics but its not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didnt figure out but what the eye doesnt see the heart cannot grieve over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are goodhumoured all together the setting is similar to that in the Â„batman movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not selfevident and a more or less surprising endingbr br with this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends dont watch the credits at the beginning and then look whos the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their makeup
