most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog the tim burton batmans had it as did in an even more grotesque manner sin city with dick tracy producerdirectorstar warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde dick tracy is filled joyfully with archetypes and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities villains like the stooge shoulders lips the brow mumbles the blank pruneface spud chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriouslybr br if at the time movies like batman and underrated teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comicbook outline dick tracy is more oldschool its a story of cops and crooks or rather a cop detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguably his biggest performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style but with no such luck theres also a little kid called simply the kid charlie korsmo who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than wouldve been imagined and tracys love interest in tess and then theres the nightclub dame madonna who probably doesnt give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesnt have for her then theres convoluted dealings with taking tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voicebr br meantime as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions dick tracy adds on the winkandnod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes its a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers ie sin city which can be justifiably compared to beattys film were driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old im almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences as story music detail and a few big punches and gunshots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isnt more than it needs to and theres a heapload of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of pacinos references to other figures in quotesbr br revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits dick tracy is a hardboiled fantasy to the finest degree its filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comicbook movies ie pg13 fare and for the adults its throwback central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle even dustin hoffman hams it up and he barely says an audible word
