heh if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18yearsold comicsadapted movie rated 59 will you call me crazy thats just to catch your attention everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters its never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values dick tracy is one of those cant be easily outdated in terms of technologybr br the negative reviews mainly complained about dts messed up story but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and i had no problem following it i didnt see the comic books yet i am not a huge us comic fan but i appreciate the topnotch filmmaking and performances maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell but if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together what would you expect i had some scratches on my head and cant help but wonder did we really see the same movie the title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences madonna was more expressless than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself apparently hes bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles we can see a hybrid of scarface michael corleone adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh and many thanks to makeupsbr br to me its not bad at all the surreal feeling really got me
