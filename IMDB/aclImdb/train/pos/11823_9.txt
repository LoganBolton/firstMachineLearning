i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy bw movies then youre sure to get a kick out of this rendition the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as its meant to be i personally find madonnas musical element to be a major part of this filmthe cd featuring her music from this movie is one ive listened to often over the years its just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era in my mind madonnas finest moment both onscreen but especially musically this is sure to bring out the kid in you
