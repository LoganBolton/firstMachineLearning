i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before dick tracy came outbr br i still have the tshirt ticket i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and like that shirt dick tracy has stuck with me ever sincebr br if youve seen the movie the sharp visuals bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain its a wonder to beholdbr br as directorstarcowriterproducer beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here taking a familiar american icon and recreating him for a whole new era still set in the 30s tracy has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do ive lost track of how many times ive watched tracy and i still catch something new every time i dobr br the others are all top notch starting with pacinos big boy caprice a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them even madonnas breathless mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment she can act gasp br br but theres still such themes touched on as the necessity of family keeping true to ones self good versus evil even machiavellian themes are explored odd for a comic strip film but hey it worksbr br all in all dick tracy is a classic unto itself compared with other films of this decade it makes a strong statement its a good strong film that doesnt depend on blood violence profanity or nudity to make its point br br theres a lesson to be learned herebr br ten stars great scott
