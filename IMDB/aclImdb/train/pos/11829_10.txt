ive been watching dick tracy for years and as a result its become a vital part of my life  it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often seeing it now as an adult its still a very good movie  dark satiric and incredibly misunderstood about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received  other than that it is rarely discussed and didnt make much of a fuss when it came outbr br pacino is overthetop but to good effect as hes clearly having loads of fun beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film possibly i have ever seen just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking the lighting velvet overtones and smogsmoke combine to create a great effectbr br there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as mumbles and i dont think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting  even the mandatory kidcharacter is far better than expectedbr br overall a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5710 average on imdb the critics reviews are very positive check out rottentomatoescom and after seeing the film once again its not hard to see why  this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricitybr br highly recommended 455 stars
