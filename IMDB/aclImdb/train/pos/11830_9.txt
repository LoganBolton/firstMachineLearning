this is amazinglooking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors when it came out over 15 years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artworkbr br the characters and the story dont match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all overthetop especially the villains the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing flatop pruneface lips mumbles etcbr br meanwhile warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart and shes as sweet and soft as her name another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing the colorful other characters are played by al pacino dustin hoffman william forysthe paul sorvino mandy patinkin madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here check the full credits on the main page and youll amazedbr br the only negatives i found were pacinos voice which grates on you after awhile madonnas offkey singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun moviea cartoon strip coming to life in an incrediblycolorful fashionlike nothing you have ever seen
