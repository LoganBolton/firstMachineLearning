time for a rant eh i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 im being a little bit generous with the 7br br point 1 matt damon aggravates me i was thinking what a dicky voice they got for the main character when i first heard him narrate  and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad  his performance in the departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but thats another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfullybr br point 2 brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed not once did i find the music to fit and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought id start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the superamerican freedom style lyrics i couldnt help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 911 in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radiohit teenbop 14yearoldgirl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i cant believe no better could have been donei refuse to had it not have been for this id rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok dont bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking  too bad its a shame they couldnt have hired better musiciansbr br i liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thickdark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they tried too hard on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparentbr br ok im falling asleep here so ill sum it up before i start making less sensebr br nice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck
