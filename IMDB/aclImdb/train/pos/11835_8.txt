while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too Â‘cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feelgoodhappystory this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids wont understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the goto guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music
