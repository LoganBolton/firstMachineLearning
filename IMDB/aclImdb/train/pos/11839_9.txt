this movie was highly entertaining the soundtrack bian adams is simply beautiful and inspiring even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well the score is also uplifting and dramaticbr br the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images the result is truly stunning i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it the story is compelling and well narratedbr br i dont understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 definately a keeper in my household
