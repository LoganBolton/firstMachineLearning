i recently watched spirit and enjoyed it very much ive seen it about 4 times now on hbo and will buy the dvd those who gave negative reviews would probably think that vanishing point was just another car chase movie and thelma  louise was just another chick flick although the conclusions of those films are darker i feel the themes are somewhat related that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you the other common trait of these movies is the caring thoughtful guardian angel types who help the main characters to overcome adversitybr br another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone elses home all one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see thatbr br i thought the animation and the story were amazing the animators really got the horses to look act and move naturally spirits emotions were very clear as the story progressed yes im aware they do humanize the horses a bit but this is fiction in a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire in other more quiet scenes which are most of the time youre allowed to savor the backgrounds one of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking singing animals route doing so would take away from the storys power instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack another plus is that they werent afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side which really made this film watchable to me this isnt prevalent through the entire movie though and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappybr br those who appreciate horses will really like this movie but i think its a bit more than a horse movie i dont feel this would be a good movie to take children to if theyre brought up on the inane fare thats offered up today but if theyre the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like the lord of the rings and black beauty theyll likely love this movie hell im 35 years old and still love that stuff
