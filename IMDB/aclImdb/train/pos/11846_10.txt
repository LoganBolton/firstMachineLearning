i liked this movie a lot the animation was well done and the romance was cute i liked most of bryan adams songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent what a lot of people dont realize is how well it relates to the heart of darknessapocalypse now themes what happens when socalled civilization invades someone elses home what does it mean to be civilized etc the opening scenery and music were very stirring the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful
