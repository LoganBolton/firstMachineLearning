well what can i say this movie really got to me its not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isnt first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack bryan adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didnt give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they  but i dont know making animals talk is just so lamebr br one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids  because it is very relaxing
