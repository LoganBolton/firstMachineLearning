spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native americans the film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse spirit encounters during his lifebr br very well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realismbr br the music is fantastic with songs by bryan adams and music by hans zimmer who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 disney hit the lion kingbr br the story is not very deep but the fact that it isnt quite as indepth as some movies doesnt in my opinion detract from the film as a wholebr br an excellent film which i enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for all the family not one to be missed 1010
