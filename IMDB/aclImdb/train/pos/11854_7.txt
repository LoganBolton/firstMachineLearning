i agree with jerry its a very underrated space movie of course how many good lowbudget ones arent underrated if i remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not ripoff of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer and like hal they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with hal it led to disaster there is at least one funny moment when the christopher cary character who cant find any food finds the abandoned pet bird theres a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesnt happen after all
