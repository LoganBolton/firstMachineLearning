wow something of a surprise though flawed it is far better that i expectedbr br the brand new space liner arcturus with some 3000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter without warning the ships cerebral central computer sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate br br soon there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ships astrogators penny the captain cary and the director of the shipping line kenyonbr br it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is actingbr br erratically the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship andbr br avoid personal conflicts in order to survivebr br the film starts out very well the opening commercial is a very nice touch there are obvious parallels to 2001 a space odyssey and to the historicbr br sinking of the titanic the film does slow down at times and has pacingbr br problems but is generally well made and well acted
