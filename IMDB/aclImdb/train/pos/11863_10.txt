perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if its not its certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what brian de palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork first there is the directors touch of brian de palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever there is the superb performance from al pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen tony montana there are the many different violent scenes that you will never forget the one with the chainsaw the one in where tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most peoples living rooms there are the many superb oneliners count how many times the word fck is used there are the superb little details the pan americanglobe that screams the world is yours or the great discomusic from giorgio moroder nothing can be named that isnt sublime here and it easily is along with the godfather good fellas and white heat one of the best gangstermovies ever made
