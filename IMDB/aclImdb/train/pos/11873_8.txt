in 1983 director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles the story begins in may of 1980 when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states 125000 left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hardworking people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted but not all among the marielitos who streamed into florida approximately 25000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cubas jails criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada scarfacebr br now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all wealth and power that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of americabr br lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative cocaine lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the top with a coldblooded iron will montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be the man and he will also know whether or not it was worth itbr br in step with de palmas vision pacino plays montana largerthanlife and he does it beautifully from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him its quite simply a dynamic memorable performancebr br michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montanas dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanorbr br the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic and blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpahs the wild bunch de palmas scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time but the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is with this film i rate this one 810 br br  br br  br br
