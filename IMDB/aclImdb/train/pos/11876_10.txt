ya know when one looks at this brian depalma film today im sure there has been allot of criticism about how dated it is also about the violence when i looked at this film on vhs when i was 20 i thought it was ultaviolent and gritty as well but i didnt get itbr br a few decades go by and man how i know how much i didnt get in this film this is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30s40s how can you improve upon a classic ya dont but you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent 80s depalma stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good filmbr br yesdisco was dying and new wavepunk were taking over but these immigrants from cuba who had to make a new home in florida couldnt tell the difference it was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it to these immigrants there was only one way to get it in florida where they wereby having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empirebr br al pacino was fantastic to me as tony montana the little train that could what an amazing way to have your lead character look at america to fight kill steal lie cheat all to get  the money the women and the powerbr br thats what tony saw as the american dreambr br he wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it tony montanas command of the english language was heavily saturated with the f word but what did you expect emily posts finishing school for him and his cohorts look at how they came to america what they knew what they were exposed to this is the way tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in america it was all about the power tony montana would and did anything to achieve itit all its violent lying stealing crooked thieving glorybr br the part of the film that personified the 1980s to me is the money laundering tonys crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank did those around tony and his crew care at the clubs where he spent and drank nope money was money and with money you get the power tony was living high off the hog he and his pretty blond american trophy he married played well by michelle pfiefferbr br after tony montanas rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there hes riddled with doubt hes drug addicted hes paranoid hes surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody takeover his trophy 80s american blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep atop of his empire becausehes going down and down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again i ask what do you expectbr br this is the quintessential 1980s film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the american dreamto obsession its violent bloody overly sobut it drives the point disturbingly home not all cubans thrown out of cuba who landed in florida in the 80s were anything like tony montana give me a break but the showing of how miserable the 1980s were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the usa to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in americabr br makes you wonder  has anything from then  been learned today
