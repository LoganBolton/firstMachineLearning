this is one of my all time favoritesbr br if the movie has a flaw its that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesnt so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the viewers imaginationbr br moroders languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of tonys inexorable fatebr br not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
