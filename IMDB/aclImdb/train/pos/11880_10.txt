scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its releasebr br it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined overthetop and all bloated up these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies it is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface is way behind the godfatherbr br but it is also true that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like the godfather or goodfellas this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics i have seen the original 1932 scarface and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake br br al pacino has been criticized to be overthetop and loud in this movie but how about considering that that is precisely the way the filmmakers wanted tony montanas character to be he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute he is not the calm michael corleone here he is tony montana a very tacky uneducated individual who doesnt really think much and gets angry all the timebr br there is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie the soundtrack is all 80s i love some of the songs including gina and elviras theme push it to the limit and the title track instrumentalbr br there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the rebenga hit the first meeting with sosa and tonys visit to his mothersbr br about the performances al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes one wonders what scarface would be like without pacino i just couldnt imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities the film wouldnt be as effective without himbr br steven bauer shines as tonys friend mannybr br robert loggia is wonderful as tonys boss lopez so is f murray abraham as omar in a small rolebr br then there is some eyecandy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful and is adequate in her rolebr br the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax without revealing anything i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handlingbr br scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland
