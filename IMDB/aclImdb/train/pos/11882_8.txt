this movie was for a while in my collection but it wasnt before a friend of mine reminded me about it  until i decided that i should watch it i did not know much about close to leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic  aids br br although the person who has aids  is leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which marcel the youngest brother of leo coupes with the sickness of his relative at first everyone is trying to hide the truth from marcel  he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother  the fact that leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young marcel i know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves  with exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from marcel they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness the fact that they allowed the young marcel to travel along with leo to paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families i know will be reluctant to do that there is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends  concern about each otherbr br close to leo is an excellent drama which i strongly recommend
