wellmade but basically dreary lowlife melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert writerdirector pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesnt do him any compliments  and he does seem to have been a troubled man as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot br br the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age huppert and costar gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern french stars  a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this daybr br i have 3 more of pialats films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also loulous oppressive realism  in spite of its undeniable artistic merit  i cant say that im in any particular hurry to check them out now
