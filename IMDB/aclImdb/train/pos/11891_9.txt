loulou delights in the same way an expensive high quality french wine does it leaves you with a very fine aftertastebr br loulous theme isnt new the film doesnt carry an original plot either its colored picturing shows fine but not extraordinary its setting is serious its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mindbr br whatever one further may say about loulou its beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them making the plot alive their acting fully invites you to participate to make friendsbr br for those around at the time loulou also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of 1980
