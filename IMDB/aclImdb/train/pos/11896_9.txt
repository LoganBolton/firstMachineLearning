i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago and fell in love with it it features t√©a leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing one episode after the next i guess it didnt make it so big and was cancelled after a few seasons but i believe it was a good run and would suggest watching itif the opportunity arises
