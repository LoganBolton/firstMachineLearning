this movie is a perfect portrayal of the nutcracker the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and i loved that floating bedbr br oh and the costumes i particularly loved marzipans the tutu was adorable the special effects were very well done eg the tree the bed etc and i quite enjoyed the rats i love how they didnt make them scary but cute and huggable except for the king i supposebr br if youre a thoroughly masculine person you wont enjoy this but this is a very good movie thats good for all ages  just not all levels of testosteronebr br but i have a few complaintsbr br firstly why did they have to put the sugar plum fairys partner in those terrible tights it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked and secondly why on earth did they have to make culkins outfit pink
