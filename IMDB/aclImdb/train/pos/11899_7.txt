those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated george balanchine production live onstage or are letting their disdain for the star casting of macaulay culkin influence their judgement the atlanta ballet was fortunate enough from the 1960s to the 1980s to be the first ballet company authorized to stage this production other than the new york city ballet and i have seen it live onstage several times i can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt dreamed up to showcase culkin it was balanchines idea to use a child in this role just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of marie the heavy dancing is left to the adults in the storybr br this is deliberately a stagebound film in a way it resembles laurence oliviers othello exactly as in that film the sets of the stage production have been enlarged to the size of a movie soundstage but not made any less artificial and the ballet is straightforwardly photographed with discreet closeups and without the distracting music video quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated maurice sendakcarroll ballard version there are only two false steps in this 1993 film one is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects mouse squeaks the children whispering magic to drosselmeyeretc those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any nutcracker and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audiences who may not relish the idea of watching a ballet on filmbr br the other false step is macaulay culkins nutcracker makeup which looks absolutely ridiculous when he is on screen as the nutcracker rather than wearing a huge mask as is always done when the balanchine production is performed onstage culkin is actually made up as the toy  he wears what looks like a bald cap as well as a white wig whiskers and a beard he also has his face rouged up somewhat and the worst aspect of his makeup is that it is still recognizably his face amateurishly transformed in a manner similar to ray bolger jack haley and bert lahrs makeups in the wizard of oz that films makeup results though worked spectacularly as this ones does not and a comparison with baryshnikovs nutcracker in his production shows how wonderfully creative baryshnikovs nutcracker mask was  the jaws actually seemed to move whenever baryshnikov tilted his head backbr br the dancing itself in the macaulay culkin version is excellent of course except for culkin himself whose dancing as i said isnt meant to even be spectacular the sugar plum fairy and her cavalier are the prominent dancing roles in balanchines production of the nutcracker the films colors though could be a bit brighter since this is a fantasy the choreography is also brilliant and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from tchaikovskys ballet the sleeping beauty  as marie sneaks downstairs falls asleep on the sofa and dreams that drosselmeyer is repairing the broken nutcracker this sequence was of course never included in tchaikovskys original balletit is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than the nutcrackerbr br those who have missed out on this film or those who despise or loathe it should give it a chance despite its two big drawbacks it is far better than it seems when one first hears that culkin is in it
