as far as i can recall balanchines alterations to tchaikovskys score are as followsbr br 1 the final section of the grossvatertanz a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is overbr br 2 a violin solo written for but eliminated from tchaikovskys score for the sleeping beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafterbr br 3 the solo for the sugar plum fairys cavalier is eliminatedbr br it seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated tchaikovskys great score is misplaced
