i gave it a 10 since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to the reason im troubling you is to add a personal observation on castles workbr br ive seen homicidal and the tingler the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white a few times and the house on haunted hill many timesbr br even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his showman tricks thus i can appreciate them for their own merit and while most pass him off as secondrate schlocky hammy etc i believe they do him a disservicebr br the end sequence of homicidal is genuinely shocking and works today  and the premise of the tingler while silly was highly originalbr br but the house on haunted hill was a triumph having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior the great vincent price and a solid cast plus a good score and production values  when i first saw it at a packed latenight showing in the late sixties it produced an audience reaction id not seen before and have not seen sincebr br it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement if youve not seen the film stop reading now and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wallbr br with no telegraphing of what is coming the camera slowly pulls back forcing the audience to switch their gaze to im saying no more my spoiler declaration above only covers this moviebr br the point is i believe this ploy was deliberate  not accidental  and when it happened the whole audience screamed including most of the men it took the audience about ten minutes to calm downbr br now that is superior filmmaking a flamboyant showman he might have been but house and the other two films ive mentioned were good movies castle may not have been a hitchcock but he was no ed wood eitherbr br its easy to concentrate on someones quirks and forget to examine their talent so i hope this documentary acknowledged that i look forward to seeing it
