this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive 50s60s environment in which he did his most characteristic worklook at the funny silly people with the ghostglassesbut its also affectionate and lively with particularly bright commentary from john waters who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time and from castles daughter who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft we never find out what became of the other castle offspring the movies were not very good it makes clear but his marketing of them was brilliant and he appears to have been a sweet hardworking family man fun people keep popping up like straight jackets diane baker who looks great and anne helm whom she replaced at the instigation of star joan crawford darryl hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with castle on the tingler and theres enough footage to give us an idea of the level of castles talentnot very high but very energetic a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased and it does make you nostalgic for simpler moviegoing days
