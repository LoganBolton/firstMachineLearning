for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite owning the tcm uk cable channel which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out more disappointingly its still mia on dvd  even from warners recentlyannounced western classics collection box set which does include 3 other robert taylor genre efforts maybe theyre saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this stalwart of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing br br i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60000000 to 3000 in the space of just 30 years as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger  who rallies alcoholic peglegged lloyd nolan who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor and teenage halfbreed russ tamblyn to this end as expected the companys relationship is a shaky one  reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony manns the naked spur 1953 another bleak openair mgm western the film in fact ably approximates the flavor and toughness of manns work in this field despite being writerdirector brooks first of just a handful of such outings but which cumulatively exhibited a remarkable diversity here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra paget also a halfbreed to be contended between the two rugged leads  and granger like the james stewart of the naked spur returns to his job only grudgingly his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realizedbr br the latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself  she bravely but coldly endures his approaches while secretly craving for granger  and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk taylor himself doesnt come out unscathed from the deal like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare  and therefore precious  hide of a white buffalo theyve caught he even goes buffalocrazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species the hunting scenes themselves are impressive  buffaloes stampeding tumbling to the ground when hit the endless lineup of the days catch and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows the films atypical but memorable denouement then is justly famous with winter in full swing a nowparanoid taylor out for grangers blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and paget have taken refuge to shoot him when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a hunched position  frozen to death br br incidentally my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this by milton lott from the time of the films original release actually he has collected a vast number of such editions  it is after all a practice still in vogue  where a book is reissued to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger  who work very well off each other here  had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant 1953which curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that its not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages
