i enjoyed albert pyuns nemesis for its cheesy action and semicomplicated script a lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why nemesis 2 nebula has a dumb as rocks plot with the same superaction to carry it throughbr br this one gives the name of the first movies hero alex to a bulked up superfemale sent to the past to save the future she is raised by a tribe in africa a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that it doesnt take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill herbr br dont get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great there are subplots involving africas political unrest treasure hunting and tribal combat the picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to musclebabe vs cyborg it has its entertainment value just dont expect quality or anything of the first movie
