this is an excellent film for female bodybuilder  female action fans i think that sue price did a great job in this film series nemesis 234 and proved to be a great fighter she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula nemesis 2 though not a film of great value and sue prices acting skills not the best to have met in my life the movie itself was something awesome a priceless gem for fans of female bodybuilder action well some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous scifi films such as terminator or predator but thats not the point the point is that apuyn casted in that film a very talented bodybuilder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 a rather boring sequel and nemesis 4 a much more interesting sequel than 3 what a pity it hasnt shown yet on dvd
