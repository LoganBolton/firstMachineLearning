you know this movie isnt that great but i mean cmon its about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kids dad says hell take him back if the angels win the pennant because he knows they wont kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel christopher lloyd rip and in the end his dad doesnt take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face its hilarious until danny glover adopts it and its friendbr br i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories the real winner here though is god because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank showsbr br as a kids movie it gets a 7 as a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 10
