with all the adult innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you dont have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids yes this movie might have a few swearwords theres that time where knox swears but they dont let you hear the full words but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come and thats including movies from back in the day not only that its very enjoyable one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the familybr br the only thing i have against this movie is that it is too short and i wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it im not going to mention them because i dont want any spoilers herebr br all in all nicely done and a great movie to watch so go out and get the kids make some cookies and watch this movie
