angels in the outfield was originally a 1951 movie from the ted turner library disney remade it in 1994 this time using the california angels now the los angeles angels as the team disney used to own this and the anaheim mighty ducks hockey team also good use of the words huhbr br this movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family a man promised the boys a family only if the angels won the pennant so he called upon god one night about this the boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way and only that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball for much of the postall star season of 1994 the angels were at the top of the al west of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is however they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white soxangels game there was no central division in baseball back then hence chicago being in the west and no angels were there to help thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games but wait in the final championship game the angels won it was a miracle indeedbr br what i liked about this film this is a good movie i mean i prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now my work was good so for one this shows that if you believe god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life and second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting this is an old disney movie too ive seen this just recently on the new disney channel blechbr br angels in the outfield will change your life forever once youve seen itbr br 1010
