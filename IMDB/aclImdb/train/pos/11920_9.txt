christopher lloyd is funny and really believable as al the head angel this movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writingbr br ok  it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do tony danza does a very realistic job in his role  but this is not a taxi reunionbr br danny glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant changebr br watch at least once  it is worth the effort to catch it
