richard brooks the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldnt even stand to hear mentioned  he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years  but then the director did run off with his wife so its understandable for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the 50s and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environmentbr br in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony manns westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way here grangers legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice hes dragged back into the darkness by robert taylors callous and proudly racist gunslinger justifying it on the grounds that ive already got the guilty conscience i might as well have the money as well raised by indians hes fully aware of the damage hes doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with selfloathing as taylor is with hate when the two men fall out over debra pagets squaw  the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills  and a white buffalo hide thats priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons a showdown becomes inevitable though the outcome certainly isntbr br taylors is certainly ironic casting  it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his 50s comeback after years of steady decline his hair color may not convince but his performance does a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesnt wear a gun the gun wears him grangers accent isnt always convincing but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends russ tamblyns halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolans onelegged oldtimer also give as good as they get but the real star is the script tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character  not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining  it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short the new french dvd is extrasfree but does boast a 2351 transfer with an english soundtrack
