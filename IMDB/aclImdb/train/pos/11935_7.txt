although i dont usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this i happened to catch the 1994 version of angels in the outfield aito on cable one saturday morning just as it was starting being an adrien brody fan i was curious to see what brody was like as a youth of 21 20 when he filmed it i suppose in this early role as danny hemmerling utility infielder for the california angels in the 1951 original the hardluck baseball team was the pittsburgh pirates the name change is a nice touch since it turns the title into wordplay i decided to give the flick a chance and it turned out to be a pretty painless even amiable experience with a decent balance of laughs tears sweetness and baseballbased excitement also my 7yearold daughter liked the angel effects  directed by mike nesmiths frequent collaborator william dear aito is the story of roger joseph gordonlevitt a foster child who prays real hard after his neerdowell dad the convincingly sleazy dermot mulroney sarcastically says theyll be a family again once the lastplace california angels win the pennant soon roger starts seeing real angels at the angels games led by christopher lloyd whose usual zany eccentric irreverence keeps aito from plummeting irretrievably into the schmaltz zone crusty manager george knox danny glover in worldweary exasperated mode is a hard sell but once the team starts winning he believes rogers angel sightings and soon knox has roger and his cute lil pal and fellow foster kid jp the adorable milton davis jr at every angels game for good luck knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language as much to appease the angels as for the kids sake resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along predictable obstacles ensue such as obnoxious sportcaster ranch wilder jay o sanders trying to make trouble for knox because of the angel angle sure it all works out fine for our heroes in the end but theyre so darn amiable you dont mind  babyfaced brody has a couple of good lines i especially like his exchange with glover about the emotional impact of the national anthem at a ballgame as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat brody isnt the only future star in aitos lineup his teammates include matthew mcconaughey and neal mcdonough and of course young gordonlevitt went on to costar in tvs 3rd rock from the sun as well as such films as 10 things i hate about you the alwaysamusing taylor negron and oscar winners but not for this film  brenda fricker and ben johnson lend able support if youre a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars aito 94 will do nicely
