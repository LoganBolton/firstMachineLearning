that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield it was on tv last night and i believe i hadnt seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and im now in my 4th year of college although the film has many flaws it is just so touching that you cant help but sit down watch it and enjoy yourself it is also hilarious danny glovers ranting is just so over the top that you cant help but laugh out loud at him at most time it adds to the film and im sure its exactly what the director wanted you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isnt the best a must see i highly recommendbr br 810
