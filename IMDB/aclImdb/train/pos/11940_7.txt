as a baseball diehard this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie authenticlooking sports action believable characters and an original story line while angels in the outfield fails miserably in the first category it succeeds beautifully in the latter two angels weaves the story of roger and jp two anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family with that of the woebegone angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games pushed by his deadbeat fathers promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamonddwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchises downward spiral and when shortfused manager george knox portrayed by danny glover begins believing in what roger sees the team suddenly has hope for turning their season aroundand roger and jp find something to believe in glover in particular gives a nice performance and tony danza playing a washedup pitcher also does well despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the windup
