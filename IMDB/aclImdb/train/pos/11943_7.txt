i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldnt help myself i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in gb which is unique among allens work along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoops most enjoyable aspect the plot revolves around johansons character a journalism student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave she falls in love with a suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allenbr br i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johansons performance but i am a bit bias i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted she plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allens stereotypical neurosis stricken character she adds appropriate body language for comic effect needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johansons character sickeningly cute and that is a plusbr br allen is allen he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of latebr br jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the lessbr br in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion johanson and allen are more detectivelike than anything however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners i did find his allusions to his last film interesting come for the humor laugh and be merrybr br needless to say if you enjoy allens work watch it if not watch something else
