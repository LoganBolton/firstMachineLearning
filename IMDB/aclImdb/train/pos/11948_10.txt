match point and now scoop have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member but corroborated what i have known for years he shouldnt focus on neurotic rich new yorkers in this case johansson plays journalism student sondra pransky whom magician sid waterman allen puts in his disappearing box where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe strombel ian mcshane who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter lyman hugh jackman so she gets to know him andwell i dont know how much i can tell you without giving it away but i can say that this is probably allens funniest movie in years theres his ubiquitous unique style of humor especially the line about his religionbr br so youre sure to like this movie if nothing else itll make you fall in love with london but mostly its just so damn hilarious even if you dont like woody allen you gotta love this one
