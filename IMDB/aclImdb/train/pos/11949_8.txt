woody allens second movie set in london tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london aspiring journalist sondra pransky scarlett johansson gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman hugh jackman she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love shes helped by stage magician sid waterman woody allen who doesnt like what he seesbr br i like this better than the over rated match point from last year it was shorter and moved much more quickly the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end its not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from allen of course its not one of allens best but its far better than his worstbr br the acting is for the most part very good allen is bad but hes played this character a million times before and its gotten tiresome but johansson and jackman are just greatthey look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances also allen surprisingly works on their sex appealthere is a sequence where theyre both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london hes not as off as he was on match point thoughmaybe hell just get better as he goes alongbr br worth seeing i give it an 8
