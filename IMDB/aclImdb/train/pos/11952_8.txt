scoop  out of  woody allen is definitely not my favorite director but i enjoyed match point it was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star woody allen it did have the beautiful scarlett johansson in itbr br scoop is woody allens latest film and though he appears in this one its ok it also features scarlett johansson and the two of them work perfect togetherbr br johansson plays sondra pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of joe strombel ian mcshane joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the reaper has taken one of those souls is the secretary of peter lyman hugh jackman she tells joe that peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of england joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to sondra during a magic act sondra is at some magic show with magician sid waterman woody allen she becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from joe not knowing what to do she enlists the help of sid waterman to help her crack the casebr br this film has a nice lighthearted feel to it compared to match point and yet it all works johansson and allen work great together allens humor fits perfect for this story and role hugh jackman is terrific as peter layman the suspected serial killerbr br this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch the cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching woody allen be himself i say give it a chance because you just might like it
