coming immediately on the heels of match point 2005 a fine if somewhat selfrepetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allens small but diehard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda 2004 and the embarrassing anything else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoops clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedybr br even more encouraging woodys selfcasting  sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years  is here an inspired bit of selfparody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters in scoop allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stagepatter who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences  if not more receptive  are at least more polite like chaplins calvero in limelight 1952 sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allens ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time br br watermans character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic bodydissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboattohades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just cant rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to watermans magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magicians climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous byplay between her and allen is very amusing  and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romancebr br scoops serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allens lengthy sabbatical exposure to londons ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woodys late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view were scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering watermans insistent borschtbelt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is watermans hilarious exit in a smart car he cant remember to drive on the left side of the roadbr br as usual allens humor in scoop includes heavy doses of injokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the films soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of griegs the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the postfuneral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose 1984 references to deconstructing harry 1997 include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harrys alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite 1995br br as to quotable gags allens scripts rely less on oneliners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this putdown of watermans wannabe crimedetecting if we put our heads together youll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allens most satisfying comedy in a decade
