allow yourself to be transported to a different old school kind of storytelling scoop is classic woody allenbr br allens latest muse scarlett johansson who also appeared in last years match point also by allen is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal looking studenttype with the aid of nerdish glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how hugh jackmans lordly character can be so smitten by her given the royals background dont worry no spoilers here there are no grand transformations for johanssons character here as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise you even forgive her characters apparent lack of logic continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer simply because he is his royal hotness jackman who is refreshing to see sans the wolverine dudsbr br if anything consistency is what the 70year old allen is all about he continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has as if hes never been exposed to modern filmmaking which is probably what makes his quiet simple films appealing they never seem to aim for a specific market as if allen makes movies to his taste alone whether the public likes it or not
