great woody allen no good woody allen definitely i found myself along with the audience in attendance laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines weve heard in a while the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett johanssons father  well sort of some have said johansson plays a young dianne keaton i beg to differ she plays woodys dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar feellike well a woody allen comedy thats fine for us woody appreciators she certainly did woodys dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy melindamelinda some may find woodys humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when its done right we look forward to the next
