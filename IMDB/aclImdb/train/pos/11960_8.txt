scoop is also the name of a latethirties evelyn waugh novel and woody allens new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity it hasnt the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of allens penultimate effort match point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but scoop does closely resemble allens last outing in its focus on english aristocrats posh london flats murder and detection this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called sid waterman stage moniker the great splendini who counters some snobs probing with i used to be of the hebrew persuasion but as i got older i converted to narcissism following a revelation in the midst of splendinis standard dematerializing act with scarlett johansson as sondra pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalists postmortem attempt to score one last top news story on the edge of the styx joe strombel ian mcshane has just met the shade of one lord lymans sons secretary who says she was poisoned and shes told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman hugh jackman was the tarot card murderer a london serial killer sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths with sids deadpan wit and sondras bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracybr br woody isnt pawing his young heroine muse  as in match point johansson again  as in the past this time moreover scarletts not an ambitious sexpot and wouldbe movie star shes morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed sid and sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief they simply team up more or less politely to carry out strombels wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondras dad sondra whos captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool rechristens herself jade spence mr spence ie woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing nonstop oneliners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that hes in oil and precious metals just as jade has told him to saybr br thats about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome at first allens decision to make johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an allaround bad decision but johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her the film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters sid and sondra spar in a friendly way and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though its artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniacbr br what palls a bit is allens again drooling over english wealth and class things his brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing his parents were english but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia xmans wolverine really pass as an aristocrat only in the movies perhaps here and in kate and leopoldbr br this isnt as strong a film as match point but to say its a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong it has no more depth than a halfhour radio drama or a tv show but woodys jokes are far funnier and more original than youll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness it doesnt matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when its diverting summer entertainment on a hot day you dont want a heavy meal the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects without vince vaughan or owen wilson critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded match point dont believe them he doesnt try too hard why should he he may be 70 but verbally hes still light on his feet and his body moves pretty fast too
