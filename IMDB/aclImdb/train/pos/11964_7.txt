i went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by scoop happily the film exceeded expectations at least a little bit its nothing heavy nothing deep  and not anywhere as good as any number of real allen masterpieces  but its also completely enjoyable as a light bantering comedy theres something kind of simple and sweet about it cute was the word i heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show it doesnt feel like allen set out to create a masterpiece here it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it compared to just about everything hollywood is producing allens stuff has a tendency to charm even the fluffy stuff these days its just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being
