reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldnt have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the writerdirector is in fine form  and found a credible way to integrate his 70year old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up allens oneliners and dialogue in a way that i havent seen in several years br br in a movie landscape dominated by softwareapproved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assemblyline formula fare for kiddies its a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and stillrewarding path
