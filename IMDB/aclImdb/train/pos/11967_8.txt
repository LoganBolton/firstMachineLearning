i dont know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever its great that this show still airs and i love michelle its cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny awbr br this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i dont know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone br br i love the episode when i think her name is dd the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a familybr br i recommend this show for everyone
