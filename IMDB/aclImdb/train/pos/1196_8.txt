i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summerthe end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was sylvan lake in the black hills bring the wagonstop the wagon etc  so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real yes doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great westernsocial comment from the 50s this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50s youth
