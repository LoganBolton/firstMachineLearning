i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless heshe is a critic or a person who analyzes story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the officeschool it makes you laugh and it is not just humorbr br yes the tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later onbr br another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those jesses talks with michelle are extremely touching if one doesnt think of it as childishbr br overall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows
