full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again ive realized that theyre incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when its incredibly cheesy its not like i hate it but just dont watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the firstbr br full house is about widower danny tannerbob sagetand his three daughters dj candace cameron stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle marykate and ashley when dannys wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave coulier and the girls uncle jesse john stamos moves in with them once they live there together they find they cant live without each other br br full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again
