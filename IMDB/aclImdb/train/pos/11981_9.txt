full house in my opinion is an absolute abc classic im not sure if ive never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it one of my favorite episodes is where jesse john stamos and rebecca lori loughlin get married if you want to know how what made it so funny youd have to have seen it for yourself it was a twoparter so youd have to have seen both parts another one of my favorite episodes is where jesse stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate  ashley olsen get locked in a gas station on michelles birthday youd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened i have many other ones that i like too everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
