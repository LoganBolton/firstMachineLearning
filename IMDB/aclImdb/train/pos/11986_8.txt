i watched speak easily one night and thought it was ok but missing something maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the labored line delivery of a leading lady the next day i kept thinking about the movie though i couldnt get durantes song out of my head i kept trying to better remember thelma todds first scene i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal a very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions so i watched another scene their show is opening on broadway buster in his blissful innocence botches every act again i was laughing out loud appreciating keatons clowning and tumbling so the next night i watched the whole movie again and this time i see it for the first time its stupendous its sensational its sublime three great comedians todd dances durante sings keaton speaks sure it aint poifectbut theres a lot of laughs in this picture
