since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept but first some insider notes from a movie criticbr br this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood joyful it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly dont see as much as we did back in the days well on to the reviewbr br talespin or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series it is much like chip and dale ducktales and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember itbr br but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgivenbr br now i dont want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that yet i feel like that we dont have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early daysbr br now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again
