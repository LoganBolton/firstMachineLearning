ahh talespin what can i say that hasnt already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most wellwritten shows ive ever encountered liveaction or animation the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for but not talespinbr br the stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice onesbr br the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadaysat least those which arent specifically geared toward it especially in cartoons in the episode stormy weather for instance kit cloudkicker decides that hes going to join an air circus but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan to which kit screams no you cant tell me what to do yourre not my dad and buries his face in his pillow the next day he leaves for the air circus this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadaysbr br the characters have a lot of depth to them baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or minus a few degrees of laziness rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you cant let that deceive you she can be a real hellion sometimes kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest he doesnt trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though hes prepared to put it right through a piratebr br in the end its the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show 1 in my book the relationship between baloo and kit is very real almost father and son this is demonstrated well in alls whale that ends whale when baloo takes kits word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults baloo and beckys relationship is also realistic due to baloos motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol sea duck not necessarily a desire to help rebecca but something tells me that if he did get the duck back hed still do jobs for rebeccabr br the sea duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed the planes functions dont change once throughout the seriescontinuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other superplanes of other cartoons it doesnt have one single weapon on boardunless you count mangoes and relies instead on its cunning pilots great skill to get out of trouble its hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesnt have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus its just such a darn cool designbr br this is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars
