as for many on here i cant help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the charactersbr br to class this work of art as a cartoon could never do talespin justice in fact its an insult to class it as a cartoon talespin is an animation and nothing less it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date when disney pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and im sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever sincebr br ill take a moment to explain from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkeys for the storys i couldnt have my children watching the mindnumbing cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50 of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it i couldnt let that happen which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80s to the mid 90s on a harddrive so one day my children couldnt be corrupted by the cartoon crap of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespinbr br talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of its depth charm wit compassion emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today do you see any of that content in say ed edd and eddie or anything else you can think of the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year olds undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picassobr br the next time you watch an episode of talespin take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted even the vehicles are true to life ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and youd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detailbr br the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the deliberate mistakes or intended mistakes in each episode and some have two for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca says youre up to something baloo and baloo replies who me im as innocent as a schoolboy take a look into rebeccas eyes i wont spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next timebr br everyone elses comments are bang on and 100 correct i have nothing else to add that others havent said already on here disney wake up and smell the coffee you have been asleep for over a decade stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing cartoons we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible
