if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated childrens show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment dont worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980s and early 1990s some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and cops a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbeddown show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip n dales rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a twohour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premierebr br while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters theres rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of preteen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters dont have and of course in the middle of it all theres baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever theres trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleekerthanmost fastestofall sea duck read james bonds aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesnt disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept sovietsatirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that childrens programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family
