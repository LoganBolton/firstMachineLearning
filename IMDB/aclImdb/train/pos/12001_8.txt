i dont know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different joseph smith prophet of the restoration than the one i sawbr br i think the movie was both welldone and inspiring i think its definitely worth watching its apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is beautifulbr br i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet josephs spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverencebr br i would definitely recommend watching this movie
