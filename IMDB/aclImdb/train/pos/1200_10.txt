have no illusions this is a morality story granger is the troubled exbuffalo hunter tempted back to the plains one more time by killcrazed taylor granger can see the end is near and feels deeply for the cost of the hunton the herds the indians and the land itself taylor on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo or indians to being with a woman while grangers role of the tortured hunter is superb its taylor who steals the show as the demented immoral everyman out for the fast buck and the goodtimes theres not a lot of bangbang here but the story moves along quickly and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan the theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the 1800smans relationship to the land and whats on it and racism considering when this was made the censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the bawdy house taylors relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue although downbeat this is truly a great western picture
