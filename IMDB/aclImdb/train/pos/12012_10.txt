i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning im going to assume that ones level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on ones level of acceptance of josephs storybr br however that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score if you get to salt lake city it is a must to see it in the legacy theater i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire lifei wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there being that im lds and regard joseph as a prophet i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few timeswhich i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started anyway im told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tells a fascinating story
