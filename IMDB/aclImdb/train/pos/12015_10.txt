thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton hestonsam burgademidway76 had past experiences with james coburnzach provodeadfall93 and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara hersheysusan burgadethe portrait of a lady96 managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
