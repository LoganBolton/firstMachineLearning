warning minor spoilersbr br i ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didnt know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just cant be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clearbr br my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you dont want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didnt show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do itbr br i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldnt have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in itbr br otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 710 it made me think now im interested to find out the facts of the real casebr br one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent moviebr br ps meadow sisto is lovely i hadnt seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol
