when i was flicking through the tv guide and came across twisted desire on the movie section i read its description three words caught my eye melissa joan hart i find her role in sabrina the teenage witch absolutely vile i hate those kind of programs so i was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old love story starring herlittle did i knowbr br it finally started on the television i had my bucket ready in case i were to puke over its cheesiness or soppiness you know what i mean at first you think shes just a nice ordinary girl whos in love but has mean parents then when you find out shes manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parents so she could be with her true love youre like whoa you just dont expect this sort of role for that sort of actress she played her role very well in my opinion i never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch and voil√† she did it perfectly congrats to her the movie was very good id definitely watch it again and recommend it to others
