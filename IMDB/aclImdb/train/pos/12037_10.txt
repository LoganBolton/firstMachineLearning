the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of 89 and again in 92 i believe it made a round on american tv on ae it was released on vhs in britain in the early 90s but went out of print a us company released it on dvd later but that version also sold out according to the website of the author of the book the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it wont be released again and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebaybr br i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out i found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks its certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east even though the dvd says made in canada ha ha but its a good copy and you cant really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare out of print and lost in legal disputesbr br i love the movie its a period piece set in the 1920s with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark for the most part the movie is very lowkey but effective and scary there is no self indulgent gore violence or much at all in special effects but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments its a chilling classic styled ghost movie the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930s except for the color without all the flash of all the modern horror movies im afraid this film will always just be a lost gem for me it places itself as one of my all time favorites
