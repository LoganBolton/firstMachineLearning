yes a true classic this is what british drama is all aboutrealism and the minimal use of special effects and over inflated budgets i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british terrestial tv in 1994 it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plotno big names but nontheless great actingsadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime sooni myself recently acquired the woman in black on vhsso now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama you should try and enjoy it toobr br mark r horobin
