as i was when i saw this movie i will never watch this movie again not because it is a bad movie but because it scared me so much as i said i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the bookbr br all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidds bed although just before that there is something that also frightened us which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow and he hears a childs voice say its for you that scene still haunts me to this day nearly 7 years after i saw the filmbr br if you are easily scared avoid this film
