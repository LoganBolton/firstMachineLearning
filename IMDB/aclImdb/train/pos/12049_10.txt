i gave this film an 1010 with some reluctance as its hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years the sheer menace on the woman in blacks face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread br br i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years im fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people i havent seen it since i was 10 and im tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights i cant quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think its something to do with the fact that fear is the womans greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely its remarkable that other viewers feelings are so unanimousbr br ive also seen the stage play which was an excellent productionbut nothing can compare to this
