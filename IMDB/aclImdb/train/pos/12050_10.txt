most horror movies are in fact horrible movies they get to be same olsame ol same ol pack every minute with some cheap thrill usually splatter and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience for instance i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended it grew rootsbr br subtlety can be more terrifying less is more br br i first saw the woman in black on the ae channel after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it this movie almost has the feel of a masterpiece theater production that was fine with me ive always preferred british tv  movies anywaybr br most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyesfangsclaws etc hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocritybr br the woman only makes about five appearances in the film most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright if she appeared too often it couldve cheapened the mood that gets set however this movie is so well made that through much of the film were led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible the scene where she visits arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horrorbr br this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made i have a copy of the haunting the changling and a zillion more i havent seen anything that tops the woman in black yet although im still looking this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic like me a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the nonexistence of ghosts i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that id see her staring through my window etc maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate this is how a really great horror film should be like a lafanu novel the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it shes squeezing the life out of you and then its too latebr br closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and its a terrible shame that this is out of print i just paid over 40 for my second copy of this movie its a major prize in my collection now im on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama
