i saw this on tv so long ago that i cant remember when it was but it still stands out as one of the scariest most unnerving films ive ever seen there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel like the solicitor hero unsure whether its just imagination or not it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching production values be hanged good films are about a directors ability to create atmosphere using film actors locationssets music attention to detail and imagination a real gem
