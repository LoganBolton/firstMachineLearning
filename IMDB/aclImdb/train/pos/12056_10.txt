whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as amityville and poltergeist this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywoodbr br with a brilliant cast many of which star in heartbeat and other tv dramas great acting and fantastic setting which portrays 1920s life convincingly it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost storybr br herbert wise did not need blood violence or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience using your own imagination the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread and whose presence is never absent once she first appearsbr br the main character arthur kidd a solicitor learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities which may haunt him for some days some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic particularly the locked room which opens itself which turns the generator off and closes arthur in darkness the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in arthurs shoes and his efforts to shake this ghost off the writer puts many chilling additions into the story an example being the tin soldiers reappearance one is eager to learn the meaning of it all the fact we never really learn that much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettlingbr br the widow for the most part looks vicious and intimidating the scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind  having been on such properties myself i can appreciate how isolating this is and the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things ive seen one i dont wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives i have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleepbr br the woman in black is a great tv movie and a lost gem i agree to some extent the internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of £50 on it but i think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these overexposed i think its still brilliant and fantastically acted and i consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century
