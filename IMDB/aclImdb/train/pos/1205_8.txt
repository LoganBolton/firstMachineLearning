this film is exactly what its title describesan attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offerbr br first its kinda fun to see the 1996style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts sunglasses clothes and attitude it really hasnt changed any just a nice safe cheap provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types its also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to la and find out that its toronto all over again only with a strange assortment of beach bums musicians fortune tellers and yet more uppity film typesbr br i dont see pitch as a film to be enjoyed its not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someones aspirations being trampled i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses wouldbe and successful writers musicians and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big timebr br so kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning buy it or dont but the message is still there
