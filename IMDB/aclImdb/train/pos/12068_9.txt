if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of american cultural history you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film it probably was originally a play and thats why its dialogue heavy but i cant stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful charactersbr br this film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a characterdriven storybr br
