nina foch insists that my name is julia ross in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready its short and because it is the film suffers it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longerbr br when i was growing up foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles here shes a pretty young ingenue playing the title role julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs hughes and her son ralph little does she know  though we learn immediately  that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriendbr br its a livein situation once julia gets to the house shes drugged and when she wakes up shes told shes mrs hughes and not allowed to leavebr br the acting is very good low budget but still entertaining  some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why i said the movie is too short nevertheless i recommend it
