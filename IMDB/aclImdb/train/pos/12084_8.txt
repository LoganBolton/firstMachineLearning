a toothsome little potboiler whose 65minute length doesnt seem a second too short my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem  hitchcocks the lady vanishes is one example outofwork julia ross nina foch finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend after reporting to duty she wakes up having been drugged in a vast manderleylike pile on the cornish coast supposedly as the barmyinthecrumpet wife of george macready who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks his doting enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of goodvsevil than she occupied in the lady vanishes the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically we know whats going on but are powerless to tell poor julia this movie curiously is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few british films noirs i think its closer to the gothic olddarkhouse tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption it does however evince a more modern psychoanalytic cast of mind whatever you call it it remains a sharply satisfying thriller
