hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show br br yes it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard hunter the ateam etc etc etcbr br this show is just good clean television the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing they often take jabs at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show it contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesnt enjoy a good car chase especially with the coyote br br i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this
