br br film dominated by ravenhaired barbara steele it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle seeking blood steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty and the views of the walking dead predate romeros night of the living dead shamblers unifying them in my mindbr br i dont see the connection between this film and the haunting which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present la danza macabre is a bmovie without pretention daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences theres no such draw to hauntings overwrought claire bloom the comparisons to the haunting are superficialbr br and no this movie does not need to be remade not only is it a product of the sixties but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood cannot fathom macabres formula for terror that formula is based on one overriding factor good writing lowgrade classics like castle and cormans poe films with r matheson and tourneurs out of the past share a commonality of strong writing its simple get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into todays cinematic mess besides that let hollywood attempt some original material for a change and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past
