i saw this film when i was 10 or 11 years old alone in my parents basement on a saturday night it was being shown on chiller theatre a regular fright feature that i watched religiously as a young un now i have seen many old horror films thanks to chiller theatre but none ever stuck with me like danse macabre aka castle of blood i am 51 now and only last year was i fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent quality dvd edition of this wonderfully shudderinducing supernatural classic having thought id never manage to see it again i have already watched it four more times and cannot seem to get tired of itbr br they just dont make spook films like this one anymore haunted catacombs and mistenshrouded graveyards just dont work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day anyway this one has edgar allen poe and barbara steele deliciously shadowy cobwebwraped haunted castle sets restless spirits reenacting their deaths and a wickedly ironic endingbr br imo this ones right up there with robert wises the haunting the innocents with deborah kerr and the more recent the others
