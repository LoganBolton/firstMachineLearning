i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television scared the hell out of me but then i was a teenager back in those days not as jaded about films as i am nowbr br castle of blood aka danse macabre is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre along with mario bavas black sunday1960 curse of the living dead aka kill baby kill 1966 and mario caianos nightmare castle 1965 if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing then check these out as well i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same periodbr br i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and its a great improvement over that old panandscan print that was making the rounds on television over the years it adds a couple of minutes of dialog in french that dont really add much to the movie as whole but its nice to see it complete without cuts unfortunately the dvd doesnt really offer any extras beyond stills from the filmbr br one flub i noticed was in the opening scene seeing the smokeeffects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inns front door i guess the editors didnt catch it at the time or maybe they didnt care but it is something i didnt notice the first time thats the wonders of dvd you get to see all the flubs mistakes and details that werent apparent the first time around but no matterbr br but no matter it still gets a 7 on the imdb meterbr br
