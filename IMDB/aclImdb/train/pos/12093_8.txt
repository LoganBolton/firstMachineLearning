italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960s  and this is certainly one of them the first thing you will notice about danse macabre is the style of the film shot in beautiful black and white and due to director antonio margheritis use of lighting the film almost looks like it could be a german expressionistic horror film this coupled with the horrorfilled plot line ensures that danse macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror of course the fact that the beautiful barbara steele appears in the film doesnt harm matters  and the good news continues as in this film she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous the plot is very aware of the time in which this was released and so incorporates the great edgar allen poe we follow alan foster a writer who accepts a bet from poe himself and lord blackwood that he cant spend an entire night in the latters creepy old castle everyone that has spent the night there previously has diedand our hero is about to meet the previous wagertakers br br nowadays horror films dont tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isnt much beauty left in the genre it is refreshing therefore to see this film many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful  from the female side of the couple wearing just a seethrough skirt to my personal favourite  a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door this my first antonio margheriti film and even after seeing just this one its obvious that he was one of italys premier directors also interesting is the fact that screenplay was cowritten by another of the italian greats django creator sergio corbucci the plot can meander a little too much at times but theres always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring  and the fact that it is always intriguing even when the plot slows down ensures the same thing the way that danse macabre utilises the haunted house theme is both well done and original and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible on the whole fans of italian andor cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem
