i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old rialto theatre as part of a saturday afternoon matinée triple bill which also featured vincent prices last man on earth and mario bavas nightmare castle i had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards though i didnt know it then all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre no wonder i was so scared though all three films frightened me it was castle of blood that had the most profound impactbr br it was the first on the bill i didnt even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie thats lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes the unedited runs 87minutes but despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined castles fog enshrouded cemeteries shadows and cobwebs gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last 20 minutes scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection since it was a french  italian import it wasnt a movie that showed up on the late show in winnipeg i couldnt quite remember the title remember i didnt get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless and to make matters worse the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles aka danze macabre coffin of terror castle of terror long night of terror etc and the usauk working title castle of blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it illusive but thanks to the internet and perseverance i found it at last what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy but as haunted house movies go its stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as the haunting the innocents or black sunday the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio margheriti it stars 60s scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio corbucci about a sceptical writer georges riviere who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest  as is arturo dominici as dr carmus and margarete robsahm as juliabr br many of the tricks margheriti employs to create the films eerie atmosphere cobwebs creaking doors fog etc are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour rather than using body counts and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way relying on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the films suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writerbr br the film is not without faults the pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the 20 minutes i originally missed this is probably worsened by synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored  in terms of the intro  it may have been more of hindrance than a help the english voice dubs are merely passable and in the restored scenes the language shifts from english to french english subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewersbr br however synapse films deserves kudos for the quality of the print clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly sobr br i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60s italian goth films or anyone who enjoys a good ghost storybr br rob rheubottom winnipeg mb canada
