in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated moviesbr br this movie does contradict the first i wont deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didnt even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly beganbr br this was my favorite movie at age 36 and it did not scare me or confuse me at allbr br
