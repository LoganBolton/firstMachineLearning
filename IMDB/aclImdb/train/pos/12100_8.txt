the dvd for danaza macabra castle of blood is very odd thats because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french sometimes characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed it made no difference odd but still watchablebr br the story purports to be based on a poe story though i cant recall which one in fact the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the filmthough it didnt look especially like himbr br a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home it seems like an easy bet to wineven if the house is very creepy however it cant be that easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet diedyet this fool still wants to make the wager while in the home he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls madly for her later however he learns that she died more than a decade earlier how can this be i could tell you more about the plot but dont want to spoil any of the suspense see it for yourself to find out the rest of the storybr br this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere the house black  white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film as for the plot its interestingespecially because there are many twists and turnsso many that you are wondering just who is and who isnt among the undead by the end of the filmbr br the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed crazy as it might sound i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessarybr br also parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless but its hardly necessary for the plot
