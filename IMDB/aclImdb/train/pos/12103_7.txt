i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i havent liked and have always been a sucker for a good hauntedhouse story especially for such wonderful pictures as the legend of hell house and the original versions of the haunting and house on haunted hill so i had a feeling that castle of blood would be right up my alley and boy was it ever this frenchitalian coproduction while perhaps not the classic that steeles first horror film black sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the spook genre filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma the film concerns a journalist who bets one lord blackwood and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in blackwoods castle on the night of all saints day when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate the viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible for the most part the film does indeed send shivers up the viewers spine and in the uncut dvd that i just watchedthanks to the fine folks at synapseeven features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism and barbara is wonderful in this movie her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable not for nothing has she been called the queen of horror
