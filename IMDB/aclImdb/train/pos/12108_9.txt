yakitate japan translated as fresh baked japanese bread is the story of a young man named azuma kazuma and his journey to make the perfect japanese bread or japan for japan and for the japanese that will be recognized the the whole worldbr br of course thats just on the outside in reality yakitate japan isnt really about the bread but the reaction that come after eating the bread and the pun that comes with the reaction the series is lovable because of these puns from popular anime titles like naruto detective conan and dragon ball to blockbuster movies like the matrix and lord of the rings its all therebr br so what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like cooking master boy or mr ajikko well unlike the others who use cooking for world domination yakitate japan is purely comedy sure there are times that the story turns to drama or even murder but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them youll be laughing at their own view of heaven just watch itbr br just remember that this is also fiction although some of the bread made here are based on real bread eating the home made japan 2 wont turn you to a super saiyan or turn your body to rubber
