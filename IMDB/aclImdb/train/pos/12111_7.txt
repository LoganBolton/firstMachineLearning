when i first started watching this anime i never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting but thankfully i was mistaken from the moment i started watching it anime just pulled into the world of bread making i was hookedbr br the biggest advantage of this anime is its humor which is very intelligent and very funny with some recurring gags but the animation soundtrack and character development are below average while these disadvantages arent seen so much in the first episodes because of the great job on this anime it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old and arent as funny as beforebr br as far as im concerned if this anime had ended with episode 52 i would have given it a 9 but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste which sadly cant be washed away by the awesome 50 episodesbr br 710
