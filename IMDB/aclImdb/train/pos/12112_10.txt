the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesnt matter if its subtitled or dubbed  its that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song theres an africanjapanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime youll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far
