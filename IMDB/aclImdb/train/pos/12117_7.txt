although this film put davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitressprostitute mildred rogers this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole the acting is indeed fine in most every respect what i cannot fathom for the life of me is just how or why phillip a sensitive wellbred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him i find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects yes i know he is a sensitive clubfooted introverted intellectual but davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable davis is astounding in her role yes she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then but its a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it too bad she wasnt playing a gangsters moll her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among lowlifes
