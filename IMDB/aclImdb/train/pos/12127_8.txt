the story is somewhat stilted what with the main characters sudden reversals of fortune but leslie howard and bette daviss portrayals of philip carey the naïve obsessed lover and mildred rogers the unworthy object of his affections raise this film considerably above standard melodramabr br sensitive cultured philip who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for mildred is not unlike a character howard was to play a few years laterashley wilkes the southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough reconstruction era philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before mildred enters the picturehe doesnt even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him hell never make it as a painter it is perhaps this passivity these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish cockney waitress for as long as he doesbr br although leslie howard is memorable today of human bondage is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy mildred may have a grating voice but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her one may also think she is on to something when she accuses philip of looking down on her for not being fine enough the scene in which philip and norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm thisbr br most of the supporting characters are also effective particularly norah the sensible romance writer who loves philip but knows she can never compete with mildred and sally who has mildreds beauty and norahs decency and emerges as the deserving woman philip is rewarded with in the end the only character i found hollow was sallys eccentric ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier erabr br a classic that deserves it reputation
