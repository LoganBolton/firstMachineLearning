how amazing this film is ive seen it over and over throughout the years and im always spellbound by it the reason why the film is so easy to rewatch is of course the arresting performance given by the young bette davis she not only steals every scene that shes in but is actually much prettier and better photographed here not to mention sexier than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio warner brothers this film was made by rko radio pictures she wears a very flattering makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and oh those lovely big eyes especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in londons soho her body was so curvy when she was young get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard and oh boy she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene howard is a little too nervous throughout but he does captures the heros sensitivity frances dee scores as the sweet pretty young sally who truly loves him max steiners score is both charming and poignant splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel
