this movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes i wont deny that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then its a very good movie i remember watching this in the early 80s and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie not that i didnt enjoy that one too its just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it sure its darker than the first one too but perhaps maybe thats why its so good and its dark in deeper kind of subtle way too that kids may not fully understand but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off and adults watching will surely get quicker as i have now watching this film again now in my midtwenties where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spiritdemon in exchange for something else get the picture but simply watching that as a child sure as i said it may have been a little scary but nothing traumatizing in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age i cant tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to imprison me have me help him capture the care bears tried to make me turn over to his dark side and other things like that etc so this movie was also good for my imagination and its also got great emotional depth to it too i used to watch it at least once a weekbr br also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart i always thought so and i always willbr br now its just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie as good as it isbr br what good is love and caring if it cant save her
