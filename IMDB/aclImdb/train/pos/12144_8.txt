i thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th chamber of shaolin but actually its more of a lighthearted sister to the original gordon liu still stars as a wouldbe hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky manchus but this time around its lighter and more comedic the film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new manchurian bosses liu plays chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill but his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect thembr br the comedy really begins at the monastery where chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted this sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography continuing in the 36th chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting and supremely hokey training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weaponsbr br also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building chao is not accepted as a student at shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery on the dvd i bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director lau karleung drew from it this is a craft many hundreds perhaps thousands of years old and in hong kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large highrises though the west exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps as a result of his scaffolding work chao develops a special style of kung fu when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu which he first tests during a dustup with the monasterys abbot in the final confrontation with the manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and tiesbr br from a comedy perspective i think its one of the best of the kung fu genre as a kung fu film in general it also stands out i recommend it to anyone
