i had watched and recorded this a few years back on local tv and having been underwhelmed by it i subsequently erased the tape however when it was released by mgm as part of a midnite movie doublefeature dvd of curtis harringtonshelley winters films for a very affordable price i couldnt resist giving it a second look this has since gone outofprint actually i received the dvd a few months ago but only now with harringtons passing did i get to it thankfully this time around i was more receptive to the film and in fact now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane 1962 imitations with whom incidentally it shared screenwriter henry farrellbr br the film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s depression america  with its childstar craze and sensational murders exploited during the fake newsreel opening its stylishly made kudos to lucien ballards cinematography and the set design by eugene lourie and boasts an effective david raksin score shelley winters debbie reynolds and michael macliammoir deliver excellent performances the latter is especially impressive as the largerthanlife and vaguely sinister diction coach though he ultimately proves a mere red herring also featured are dennis weaver and agnes moorehead hers is only a cameo really as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radiobr br many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids including an amusing mae west imitation but i personally wasnt bothered by them the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and perhaps needlessly convoluted plot reynolds  a musical star herself  is ideally cast as the dancingschool owner and despite their onset rivalry she and winters work well together the latter in fact gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew auntie roo 1971 the narrative then comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand guignoltype denouement apparently the film was toned down it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism by producer martin ransohoff  against harringtons wishes  in order to get a pg rating
