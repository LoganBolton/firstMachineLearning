well heres another terrific example of awkward 70s filmmaking the rudimentary premise of whats the matter with helen is quite shocking and disturbing but its presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis harrington whoever slew auntie roo and scriptwriter henry farrell hushhushsweet charlotte in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but theres a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging 1930s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tapdancing the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique were literally catapulted back to the 1930s with a sublime depiction of that eras music religion theatrical business and wardrobes following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to lifeimprisonment for murder adelle debbie reynolds and helen shelley winters flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia she only listens to the ramblings of a radioevangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies the script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced theres never a dull moment in whats the matter with helen although the singing tapdancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters shes downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady whos about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers jason voorhees and michael myers combined there are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like michéal macliammóir as the cocky elocution teacher agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies house there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an oscar are breathtaking
