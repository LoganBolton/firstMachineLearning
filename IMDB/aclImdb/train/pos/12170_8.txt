romantic comedies can really go either way you know youll see one thats really sappy and youll think you want something more realistic then youll see one thats realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested or maybe youll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you smile romantic comedies are tough movies you go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to youbr br of course if youve got a girl next to you and youre a guy like me it probably doesnt matter all that much whether the movies any good youve got other things on your mind for you i say go get her tiger for the rest of us i say see a guy thing its a lot of funbr br because a guy thing knows youre going in to this movie with expectations so it doesnt pretend that its guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and its not his wife plot is going to make everyone happy sure maybe you like it but maybe it doesnt ring true or you think its cruel a guy thing covers that what a guy thing does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast ive seen in a long time so if you dont the main plotline youve still got something to make you smilebr br whether were talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen like larry miller pretty woman best in show james brolin traffic julie hagerty airplane david koechner saturday night live and conan obrien regular dirty work austin powers ii or thomas lennon the state and viva variety or new faces like shawn hatosy the faculty or colin foo saving silverman were talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the films inspired characterisation steal the show time after time and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these daysbr br and thats not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along because its very sweet and terribly well done jason lee mallrats chasing amy dogma etc is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually isbr br a lot of the success of the movie though falls on julia stiles the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wears it well not since gosh i dont know when have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy of course its all in the closeups the voice and the subtle smiles but its magical and its one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first placebr br but julie stiless slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly deadon in their classic simplicity this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then comes through with a great deal of heartbr br a guy thing is a movie youve definitely seen before and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it we havent really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at playbr br for the record it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of itbr br and guys i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lees friends in this movie im not going to spoil it for you but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema i suggest you just say its a guy thing and leave it at that
