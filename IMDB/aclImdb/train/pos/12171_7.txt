i was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his bossfuture fatherinlaw and coworkers see him scratching himself isnt terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter very few of the films gags are highbrow but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way br br the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolins character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the obstacle in the plot a total witch the selma blair character is hardly unlikable and theres never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywoodish but it couldve been much more schmaltzy br br the cast is talented i havent had a favorable view of most of jason lees mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin smiths films that i couldnt help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles even in this movie he doesnt look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia stiles proves again why shes so damn likable of course shes a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i dont know the actresses name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious julie hagerty also has a small part and shes always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that its a shame she doesnt get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills br br dont be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so its always to see a good one among all these bad apples br br my score 7 out of 10
