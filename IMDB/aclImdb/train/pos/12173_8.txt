first a quick shut up to those saying this movie stinks you cant go to every movie expecting citizen kane this was actually a fun movie jason lee is good in everything he does the only flaw in this movie is i dont think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles they should have dwelled more on that other than that the movie is good fun selma blair needs to eat something shes worrying me but she still looks beautiful so yes i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun go seebr br rating 12 out of
