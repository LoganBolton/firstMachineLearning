i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting moviein a guy thing jason lee plays paul a straightlaced seattlebased fellow who is about to marry his fianc√©e karen selma blair and settle down to an unchallenging life of middleclass domesticity we first meet paul at his bachelor party where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his surprisingly few buddies encourage in case hes a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife of course the next thing paul knows its the morning after the night before hes in bed with a naked hula dancer and his motherinlaw phones to inform him that karen is on her way over oh and the hula dancer is karens cousin becky julia stilesbr br from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure trying to cover up what hes done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful familyoriented good guy whos superexcited about his forthcoming nuptials his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrongdoing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the funloving becky forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance definitely worth a watch
