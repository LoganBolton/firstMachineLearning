i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea i think the darkheart character is a little on the rough side and i dont like the way he shapeshifts into a mean frog fox boy i was wrong this movie was made for my kid not for me she gets it when it went over under my head of course i dont get it this isnt one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing there isnt any political junk ether theres no magic key that will save the world from ourselves nobody has the right to access excess and everyone isnt happy all the time and as a side benefit nobody dies russwill
