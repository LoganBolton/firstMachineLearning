despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didnt quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film thats mostly people talking with each other in various situations thats quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a 7 for mebr br the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael ohara ohara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him ohara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk ohara into working for them despite his initial reservationsit seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and ohara doesnt want to get involvedbr br shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says hes arthurs partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks ohara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly ohara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealedbr br maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far im not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i havent seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but ive tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performancearty i love f for fake vérités et mensonges 1974 for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale 1967 when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7the same as my current score for the lady from shanghaibr br welles performance and the dialogue hes written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me hes a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotonehe tends to sound like hes reading his performance reminded me of what ive seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in orson welles the oneman band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that hes inherently sublimely dramatic im also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me toobr br as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course shes gorgeous which doesnt hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to mei never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesnt seem to fit welles often shoots him in closeup and anders almost always has some overexaggerated manic expression on his sweaty facebr br structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soapoperatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crimemystery film its too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellencebr br the ending is more actionoriented lessdialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crimemystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a 9 the final scenes are easily 10s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time its well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolismbr br the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually cant make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the mazelike caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romancebr br surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course its worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isnt exactly a terrible film in my view but its dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution
