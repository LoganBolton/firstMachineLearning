this could be well have been the definitive film noir of all time had not the columbia studios cut so much of orson welless original what we are left with is a flawed yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of welles as an actordirector and rita hayworth as a serious dramatic talentbr br the lady from shanghai is film noir at its most sizzling and confusing welles with an uneven accent portrays michael ohara a journeyman irishman who after a fateful encounter with the seductive dangerous elsa bannister hayworth in a great performancefinds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husbands everett sloane yacht elsa or rosalie as michael likes to call her plays the innocent helpless doll very well ensnaring ohara in her web as the lovers conduct a notsosecret affair at sea arthur bannisters partner in his law firm george grisby glenn anderscomes aboard he is a weird untrustworthy figure who offers michael a unique proposal he will get 5000 to assist grisby in the faking of grisbys death so it looks murder the plan is for michael to get off a technicality and run off into the sun with elsa but things do not go to planbr br hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal at times she seems genuinely vulnerable and childlike at others brutal worldweary and hard always she is brilliantly beautiful whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black brandishing a gun hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is a farcry from her famous gilda role her thenhusband orson welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop angering columbia boss harry cohn it was a terrific marketing ploy and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully she is not the sympathetic femme fatale that gilda is here instead she is a predatory blackhearted dame who sees murder as a very useful optionbr br the welles and hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage they would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship they are hateful not romantic lovers in this so its hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality with welles as the fall guy he even admits it himself in the film and rita as the doublecrossing babebr br welles character is the typical noir drifter with not much sense as welles voiceover proves to use ohara indeed does not use his brain very much expect to be thinking of her elsa welles usually played intelligent charismatic fellows so his turn here as the dimwitted michael is unusual and very interesting indeed welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it wellbr br everett sloane is suitably slimy as hayworths crippled husband one wonders why he hires michael it is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically so why does he invite a threat on board one interpretation could be that michael provides the service to his wife that bannister cannot in his crippled state there is definitely something to that theory with a lot of implications toward elsas behaviour before she met her husband was she some sort of prostituteand grisbys knowledge of bannisters most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenesbr br this is a jumbled convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed we are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot as with most noirs welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches including the justifiably famous hall of mirrors climax its a terrific scene one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness this fun house scene is visually stunning with a dalilike feel to the painted sets apparently orson painted them himself subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by welles enhances the plot and makes this a thoughtprovoking experiencebr br the dialogue is scorching and confusing delivered superbly by ritas alternately breathy low voice and helpless highpitched littlegirl voice hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatale of noir its a pity only a slight one  as rita was a brilliant dancer that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for columbia in the 40s instead of darklythemed noir like this she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talentbr br 910
