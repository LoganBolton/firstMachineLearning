platinum blonde in this one as dazzling as freshfallen snow but nowhere near as purebr br to reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal noir would be criminal its as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes but the film holds far darker secrets from the ny times childhood shadows the hidden story of the black dahlia murder by mary pacios mary pacios who was 5 years old when she was befriended by 15 year old bette short retraces shorts steps interviewing friends and associates she also offered a detailed if speculative analysis of orson welles particularly in regard to his movie the lady from shanghai according to ms pacios the movie along with related archival materials has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with shorts murder she raises the question could welles have been the killer interesting theories and with the spate of books now out on the black dahlia much more may come to light fritz langs brutal film noir the big heat 1953 was a romanaclef telling of the dahlia killing in the city of nets that was la but its the orson opus that the dahlia had a handson connection to in reality it was bugsy siegel and the hollywood mob wars of the 1940s that did the dahlia in but that doesnt negate much of what pacios wrote almost all of hollywood intersected with elizabeth the black dahlia short and her taleauralegacycurse is encoded in a number of golden age filmsbr br the black dahlia was always on the peripheral edges of shanghaieven before it started filming barbara payton on franchot tone it was when he was thinking about making the lady from shanghai before he lost the option to orson welles franchot said hed been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the dahlia in the formosa cafe across from the goldwyn studios the floor above the formosa cafe was bugsy siegels office and the dahlia one of his on againoff again working girlsbr br it gets deeper and darker after the 1951 brawl over barbara payton between tom neal and franchot tone that sent franchot to the hospital with a concussion and never talking the same way again barbara said she married tone just to spite neal tom detour neal also knew the dahlia who didnt and became obsessed from la despair by john gilmore the january 1947 slaying of the young beautiful wouldbe actress elizabeth short known as the black dahlia was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime a project called who killed the black dahlia was being kicked off by actor tom neal a hellraiser from ww ii movies potential producer gene harris someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by tom neal and his cohorts not long after it would be very clear one beautiful day to come when tom would sneak up on his pretty new palm springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a 45 bullet through her head barbara payton and norma jean dougherty later marilyn monroe knew the dahlia and their stories are well known it seems all who crossed the path of the dahlia like the proverbial black cat entered a twilight zone darkness andor had an incredible string of bad luck afterward tonenealwelles are only a few and this includes a butchered film called the lady from shanghaibr br lady from shanghai took two years to be released thanks to extensive reediting and all because columbia president harry cohn couldnt understand the story its dark noir to be sure one of the darkest in fact its also a wicked satire on life in the new atomic agebr br nicolas christopherbr br shanghai pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the american city the films principal murder victim and there are many a psychotic and doubledealing lawyer manically foresees armageddon at every turn claiming he can feel it he announces that he plans to escape to a remote pacific island a particularly acid joke on welles part since this was the very year the us began testing atomic bombs at just such a place the bikini atoll relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem by the time of bikini the erotic identification of hayworth with the bomb appears to have been institutionalized with the blessing of the military brass the first bomb dropped in the pacific testing ground in named gilda and has hayworths image in provocative dress painted directly on its casing br br its ironic that orson welles broad interpretation of an irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many welles is giving a clue to viewers that michael ohara is only the storyteller  not part of the story even though it revolves around him ohara contradicts the shark motif throughout the film sharks on a feeding frenzy wont stop until theres nothing left michael ohara lives to tell the tale elsa bannister causes a feeding frenzy during oharas trial and her netted chapeau suggests shes caged in so as not to devour the human spectators to a roman coleseum the spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own gossiping and carrying on about elsa a human aquarium correlating to the san francisco marine museum sequence thats the human condition except for michael ohara and yet hell be spending his life trying to forget his past elsa or die trying elsa is part of michael and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble
