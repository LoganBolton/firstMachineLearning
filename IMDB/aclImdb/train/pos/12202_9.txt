as i watched one of orson welles last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker i knew i was watching a great movie unfold though at times i did not know why the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a filmnoir averagejoe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure it is an entertaining ride and its filled to the brim with welles unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or dont feel complete in what was welles full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for thatbr br welles costars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth as mike ohara an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people hayworth is mrs bannister married to mr bannister everett sloane who played mr bernstein in citizen kane who is accompanied by a friend mr grisby glenn anders who has great control in his eyes they want to go sailing on their yacht and take ohara along for the ride and at first hes reluctant but agrees since hes falling for the married mrs as their journey unfolds ohara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with grisby who at first seems out of his gourd yet as the plot unfolds ohara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by othersbr br whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years though he doesnt have the terrific greg tolland kanes dp at his side dependable charles lawton jr assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works a particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isnt anything special and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story br br the lady from shanghai is worth checking out especially for welles hayworth or filmnoir buffs fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well it may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for touch of evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in
