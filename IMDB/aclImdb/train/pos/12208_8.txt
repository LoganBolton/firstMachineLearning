these are excerpts from a ninepage memo to mr cohn from mr welles written after orson had seen studio mogul harry cohns edited version of the picture he took an hour out br br the preview title music was written by a first rate composer george antheil although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptablethe only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer heinz roemheld is the rather weary one of using a popular songthe themein as many arrangements as possible throughout we have musical references to please dont kiss me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material the tune is pleasing it may do very well on the hit paradebut lady from shanghai is not a musical comedymr roemheld is an ardent devotee of an oldfashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as disney in other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc etcif the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative i couldnt be unhappier about the resultsjust before i left to go abroad i asked vi viola lawrence the editor to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxicab and also quite a bit of dialogue i am convinced that this would have been an excellent cutsaving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence this was not done accounting for the main weaknesses of the films opening reelthere is nothing in the fact of ritas diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendowhat does matter is ritas beautythe evil overtones suggested by grigsbys character and michaels bewilderment any or all of these items might have inspired the music instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a silly symphony a pratfall by pluto the pup or a wild jump into space by donald duckthere is no sound atmosphere on the boat a little wind and water is sorely missed theres no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screenat the start of the picnic sequencein the temporary score we used a very curious sexy latinamerican strainthis has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequelbad stock stuffthis sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved lady from shanghai from being just another whodunitthere is a big musical outburst after grigsbys line i want you to kill him this is absurdthe hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radiowas supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point as it stands now its on about the same level as the rest of the scoring nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that were kiddingthe aquarium scene needs more echo please dont kiss me is in againa bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of michaels run down the pier from the gunshot through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort for some reason this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo as a result the whole sequence seems dullthe audience should feel at this point along with michael that maybe they are going crazy the new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe theyre going to sleepthe gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with musicthe closing music again makes reference to please dont kiss methis finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picturebr br all of these edits from orson were ignored
