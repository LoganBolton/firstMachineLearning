the movie only enter the cinema in indonesia this year 2007 two years after its official release and after many illegal dvds had found its way to the public apparently the popularity of the illegal dvds lead to the release into the theaters with still public coming to watchbr br the movie is a great epic bringing japanese culture into your house in an exiting way in a sometimes humorist way the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater since the regular kabuki theater plays is something he finds boringbr br at first the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following but when the story unfolds we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new kabuki theater piecebr br the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese traditions and mythology but that doesnt matterbr br the way the story is told with a love for theater expression vivid colors humor and tragedy makes this a great ride on the rollercoaster of japanese cinema as well as theaterbr br let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at homebr br one critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying though most of it is great music there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well
