i went to see ashura as 2005 fantasia festival kickoff man that was one cool kick off the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere but due to health reasons hes still in japanoh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other moviesbr br the plot is pretty simple but somewhat originalthe demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called demon wardens are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura the demon goddess whos sleeping and supposedly is very kickassbr br it brings us to izumosome kind of elite swordsman called demon slayer and his buddy jaku whos the typical violent jealous assholebr br seems boring well now it thickensbr br izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater in a boat joyride on a nice night izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demonsfor the good cause the cause of loveand damnthe guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacrebr br izumo carries the movie as far as playing goeshe is the total packagehe knows how to fighthell yeah he knows hes witty hes intelligent and he has that grit you never have to yell no izumo its a trap the guy already knows it he has that common sense hes really the perfect herobr br as far as cinematography goes the esthetics are pretty interesting its by far the movie that looks the most like a manga its creamed full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realisticits pretty amazing lots of colours an unreal photography other than thatits pretty straightforwardbut like i said the main character is carrying the movie a must see a tale lead by masterful hands
