japan is in serious trouble demons have infested edo taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will on top of that the rebirth of ashura queen of the demons is nigh the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the demon wardens a fearsome group of warriors who might just be as bad as the demons themselvesbr br izumo is a retired demon warden who five years ago took up theater instead of demon slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child in a battle thats strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from dusk till dawn one night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named tsubaki their fortunes intertwine literally and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemiesbr br if you think this sounds like your typical japanese fantasyswordplay epic youd be wrong in fact theres nothing typical about ashura it is a hodgepodge of many different genres of film those just mentioned as well as a comedy drama and romance director yojiro takita onmyoji juggles the genres fairly respectfully although the comedy seems forced in some scenes and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn moviebr br to be sure there are flaws in the film some of the humor seems contrived and out of place and the acting isnt the greatest but seriously do you watch fantasyswordplaycomedy films for the great acting performances no we watch them for the action and the crazy cg visuals all of which ashura has in spades not to be misleading the film is not all action but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happybr br bottom line the films has its faults and is not a martial arts epic but it doesnt try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action the reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flickbr br my rating 7 out of 10 fun popcorn movie
