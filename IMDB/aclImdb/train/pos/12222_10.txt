i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with meto tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hothahahahabut i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his deathi was inside youi think thats what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that shes too young when he never cared how old the other girls werenow i dont think i myself could ever trust a cop like thatbut to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either wayand that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the storehahahahahashe was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello its called backupsometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid thingsbut thats what i think an thought about the movie
