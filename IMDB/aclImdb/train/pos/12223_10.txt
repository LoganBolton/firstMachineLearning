i saw true crime when it was first released back in the midnineties and i have watched it many times since it is a great mystery about mary played by alicia silverstone a high school senior in a california town whos classmates younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer mary meets tony played by kevin dillon a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killerbr br many suspects in this one true crime feels very true or real to me i read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true alicia silverstone is perfect in this role and kevin dillon and bill nunn do a great job as do the other actors the locations are right on and the writerdirector pat verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of marys loneliness see the scene where mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of tony i wish verducci would make more moviesbr br i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime 1010
