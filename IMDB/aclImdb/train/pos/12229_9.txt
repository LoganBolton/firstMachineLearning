to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about lowbudget scifi as a kid in the 50s thats all there was in 1957 i saw the first man into space in a movie theater with my dad it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer scared the good  plenty right out of me the memory of those heebiejeebies still lives within me the incredible melting man is almost a remake only in full glorious colorthat is wherever the scenes were welllit just gotta love it for what it isa little over an hour of darkly lit scenes disgusting noises and that eerie music bravo
