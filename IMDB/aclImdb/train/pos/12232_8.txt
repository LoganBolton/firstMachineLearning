as a collector of movie memorabilia i had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that ive finally seen it has to be the best thing about it theres nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man however theres nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most wishywashy persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite its unbelievable its incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he meltsbr br and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to scare its audience i think it missed its calling
