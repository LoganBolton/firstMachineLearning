astronaut steve west alex rebar and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn his comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend dr ted nelson burr debenningbr br this is often so uproariously funny  with enough absurd lines and situations to go around  that its hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional it seems to me to be kind of a goof on lowbudget genre efforts from the 50s and 60s and as such its a marvelously entertaining movie that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious were even treated to a split screen sequence that doesnt really add anything but is still a gas to watchbr br writer  director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea his ultraslimy character is a memorable one indeed i think his pacing is a little off some scenes like the one with the elderly couple go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky bmovie goods with a degree of panache the climax is especially funbr br arlon obers music is enjoyably shuddery yet also amusingly silly during some moments and willy curtiss cinematography creates some really great shots at times that brings me to rick bakers fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final meltbr br rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running and does what he has to do well enough debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and ann sweeney isnt so hot either as his wife but myron healey michael alldredge and lisle wilson are fine in support its also worth it to see folk like cheryl rainbeaux smith doing an appreciable topless shot janus blythe of tobe hoopers eaten alive and wes cravens the hills have eyes and even director jonathan demme in a bit partbr br this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of lowgrade scifi  horror everywherebr br 810
