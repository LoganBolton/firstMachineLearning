about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didnt try to find it anywhere then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought hey why not and tried finding it on the internet eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films i called my dad over to the computer and said to him hey dad ive found that creepy film you told me about ages ago he smiled at me turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it i started off finethen when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving at the end i pushed back my chair and stood upit made me jumpp if you havent seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettlingbr br great film
