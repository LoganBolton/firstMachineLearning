as winter approaches our stateowned broadcaster the abc has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights this commenced with a twelveyear old movie length version of emma last sunday more recent versions of three other novels persuasion northanger abbey and mansfield park are to comebr br the curious thing about this production by ae television networks with script by the everreliable andrew davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring gwyneth paltrow and clueless a modernized version starring alicia silverstone which transported the plot to beverly hills perhaps as a result even with kate beckinsale in the lead this production sank without tracebr br as a general rule much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters an outstanding example is brideshead revisited which had 13 50minute episodes back in 1982 you only have to compare the very ordinary movielength version of pride and prejudice in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 sixpart tv miniseries its not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones adapt wonderfully to film atonement is a recent example but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charmbr br given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation this production is ok kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of selfassuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters  knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of pp samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly  sybil fawlty on speed bernard hepton as emmas feeble father was also excellent we saw the damp countryside the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybodybr br even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the formalities of the times id have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the underuse of reaction shotsbr br if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and compares well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come
