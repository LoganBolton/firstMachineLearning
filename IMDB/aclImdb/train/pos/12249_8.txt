old janes mannered tale seems very popular these days i have lost count of the number of versions going around probably the reason is that her ruts are our ruts even at this late date this tv miniseries gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel headstrong opinionated emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the ambience of jane austens world may seem a tad artificial to us today if you havent seem emma ill only say that selfsufficient emma does get her comeuppance its worth watching to find out how the acting honours here go to the ladies kate prunella lucy and samantha they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane
