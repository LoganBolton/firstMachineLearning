ive really enjoyed this adaptation of emmai have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it againthough it only lasts 107 minutes most of the novel plot and subplots were developed in a satisfactory way all the characters are wellportrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompsons sense and sensibilitybr br as a foreigner i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries pride and prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin noone but her would love she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by colin firths mr darcy in pride and prejudice even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austens novels
