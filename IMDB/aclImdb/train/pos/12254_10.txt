ive seen this movie after watching paltrows version ive found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy northam more agreeable than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better austens knightley anyway both versions are goodbut anyone that loved austens books should watch this movie i agree with caalling andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the originalbr br 10 out of 10br br my 2 cents
