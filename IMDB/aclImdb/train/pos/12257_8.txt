this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow although i liked that one too it isnt so much that beckinsale is better  they are both very good  but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming and the production values here are very good its not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment but its close and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
