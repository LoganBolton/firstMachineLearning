tintin and i recently aired as an episode of pbss pov series its based on a taped interview of georges remi aka herge tintins creator from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character first in a catholic newspaper then in his own series of comic books awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of herges dreams i first encountered tintin in the pages of childrens digest at my local elementary school library reading the secrets of the unicorn my mom later got a subscription to cd and i read the entire red rackhams treasure every month in 1978 i remember seeing some tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason i didnt get any probably because i was 12 and i thought i was outgrowing them i do have breaking free a book written and drawn by j daniels published in 1989 six years after herges death havent read it yet this film also covers the artists personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ whom he later married her name is fanny and she is interviewed here if you love tintin and his creator this film is definitely worth a look update 9407ive now read breaking free tintin and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anticapitalist views of mr daniels with tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for the captain who hes staying with the captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly they and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident the whole thing takes place in england with workingclass cockney accents intact not the kind of thing herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless oh yes dog snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover which has tintin running over the police and the dedication page
