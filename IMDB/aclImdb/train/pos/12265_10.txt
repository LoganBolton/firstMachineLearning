tintin and i first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary the photography and the editing are truly breathtaking almost antidogmabr br we follow the life of tintin drawer hergé through an openhearted interview from 1971 the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century in the midst of these hergé has his own demons to fight with and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfectionbr br even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums the story of hergé is told entirely through interviews and archive material and never through reconstructionsbr br hergé lived the turbulent life of a true suffering artist but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again
