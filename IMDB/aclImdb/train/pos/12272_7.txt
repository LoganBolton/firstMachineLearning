rumour has it that around the time that abba  the multiaward winning swedish disco favourites s star had reached its zenith the band grew disillusioned with singing in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue soon after problems began to emerge in the onetimewed lockedwatertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent the band dissolved albeit unofficially in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists although they have never admitted that theres any truth in those rumours the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue if you want to appeal to the largest moneymaking media market in the entire world then you must cater for english speaking audiencesbr br its amazing for me how such a small island thats located a stonethrow away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised although not most widely spoken language in the world everyone speaks a little bit of english whether it be simply hello or a common swear word  youll find an english speaker almost everywhere pedro galindo obviously didnt agree because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd thats a real shame because its actually a decent slasher movie thats a lot better than many of its englishspeaking genre compatriotsbr br the film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown after some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his softspoken opponent but as of yet he hasnt succeededbr br later that night whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees much to the distaste of his morally superior partnerbr br they plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversarybr br after visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly storekeeper the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland hunters become hunted as they learn that the bear is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassinbr br i picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room nextdoor to me i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled which meant i never got to see the final scenes thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection br br gallindos slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepilymasked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panicstricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniacs playgroundbr br despite gallindos obvious awareness of genre platitudes the bogeyman even uses a clawfingered glove a la freddy kruegar trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown from here on the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry the majorettes which is not necessarily a good thingbr br as is the case with many latin films especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewers throat over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner its a sugarcoated point but its handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the featurebr br trampa may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentinestyle mask and the attempts at originality just about work it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing
