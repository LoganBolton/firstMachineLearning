i caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film it has all the elements of a good teen film and more  this film aside from dealing with boysgirls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young peoplebr br the film has that reallife feel to it  no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes  which for this movie was right that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film  some of which we probably know from where we livebr br overall a good movie fun to watchbr br 810
