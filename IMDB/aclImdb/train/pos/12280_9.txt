this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption isnt this a rather consoling thoughtbr br when i watched it for the first time i thought that after the won election the movie would be over  i didnt know the book so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the filmbr br many people here utterly dislike this movie i cannot understand that one single bit maybe those who read the book first are  as often with screen adaptations of novels  simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold unseen unexplained but as a movie telling a touching story  the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and conservatism  this movie is simply splendid furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well  especially winona ryder and jeremy ironsbr br so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for
