could not understand why jeremy irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent spoken through clenched teethand from the back of his throat in fact it rather spoiled the film for me and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him very irritating no other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst i have always rated jeremy irons as a fine actor i would not class this film as being one of his best the film however has whetted my appetite as have some of the other comments made re this film which i have found very interestingand intend to now read the book
