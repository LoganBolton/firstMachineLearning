i liked the movie first of all because it told an interesting story but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a muchlonger story since the book is over 400 pages that makes sense it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s in a fictional south american country also a lot to fit into the time available i think it would have been much better as a sixhour miniseries than it turned out as a 140minute moviebr br even though its rushed the story doesnt skip so much that it gets confusing what is told is told fairly well one fault is that claras supernatural powers appear inconsistently either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie or they should have been left out two more faults which could be spoilers estebans eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly and ferulas curse seems to wear off even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure foreverbr br the acting is excellent glenn close as the tormented spinster ferula is outstanding jeremy irons as the brutal selfmade rich man is also excellent meryl streep as the main character clara is great although shes often even better than she was in this movie there were many wellperformed smaller roles too the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent
