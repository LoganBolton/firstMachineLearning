before all id like to point out that i have not read the book so there was no chance id be disappointed in that aspect the major flaw i spotted was historical detail with several cars trains clothes etc i think donÂ´t belong at that timebr br possible spoilerbr br the technical aspect of the film is ok nothing to brag about but the acting i think was terrific i dont have no experience in acting still i cant believe how people can consider this terrible maybe theyve only seen two movies ever and the other one must have been very good indeedbr br i specially liked jeremy irons and really understood his character someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work then fights against those who would take his lifes work from him only he gets so involved in this fight he doesnt realize reason is no longer at his side and he ends up a beaten disappointed man irons made this so believable i sympathized with the character despite his brutalitybr br after jeremy irons winona ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend banderas he had an underdeveloped part i think and glenn close was also very good meryl streep had an average performance it was not bad just not up to the standards of the other actors watch out for miguel guilherme a fine portuguese actor between so many starsbr br in contrast to todays movies here only the interpretations only people matter but at the same time it is not a pretensious film too worried trying to be intellectual the best proof i really liked it im writing a review 7 years later
