this 1991 nbctv movie aired six months before john goodmans bigscreen version of the life of babe ruth came out for my money there is no comparison between the two the tv production isnt perfect but it presents the babes story with more depth and complexity than goodmans onedimensional telling i especially enjoyed the films depiction of the complex lovehate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins who always understood his star players brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruths own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players the tvmovie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the takingbr br this film makes a great companion piece to eight men out since the story starts with ruths arrival in new york in 1920 one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin indeed the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his eight men out role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis
