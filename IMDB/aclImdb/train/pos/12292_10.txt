i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carné almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail id like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing hôtel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie  the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks
