this is an excellent film and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings as it is unavailable on videodvd the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving and ends with them leaving although quite a lot happens in between and they dont stay in one place during this time gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that all is right with the world if you get a chance to see this film then do i cant wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release
