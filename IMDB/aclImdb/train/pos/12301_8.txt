its sort of crazy but i taped from tcm both this german version of mgms anna christie and the english onebut i got to see this one first cos id heard that many people thought it was better than the english versionbr br without having seen the other one i cannot compare them but anyway this is an excellent early talkie with a straightfromtheheart performance by garbo she looks very beautiful in this film her face shines throughout especially when cameraman william daniels gets those gorgeous closeups of herbr br the atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular mgm stuff made on that era it looks very similar to french or german expressionistic films from the thirties well it was directed by a great french director monsieur jacques feyder who had directed garbo in 1929 in the kissbr br theo shall is excellent and gives an absolutelly believable performance as annas sweetheart the hardboiled tough sailor whos just a kid in mans body also hans junkermann gives a very fine performance as annas alcoholic father and salka viertel too as a goodhearted old cheap flooziebr br in all quite an experience because its the only film were you can listen to garbo speak in a foreign languagecos all the other films she did in either sweden or germany were during the silent erabr br serious flick
