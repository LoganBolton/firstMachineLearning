there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in itbr br it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music scorebr br i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk i will certainly be adding it to my collection
