first things first the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed now actress wang zu xian the one who played xiao qian in the movie is 42 years old and well aged its always good to review these glorious times when seeing oldschool hongkong productions like thisbr br the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s the art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it it feels like a horror movie but ultimately its not scaring but only funbr br i had the experience of translating the second script of a chinese ghotst story and i thought that script was a decent write however when i saw the movie i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles however it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertainingbr br if you have seen the lord of the rings you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch its definitely a laughoutloud bravo
