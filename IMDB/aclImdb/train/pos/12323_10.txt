this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger hidden dragon the movie is a unique combination of several genres its a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of thisbr br this movie definitely makes it to my top 5 and should be enjoyable to every movie lover the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way its shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ghosts can flybr br see this movie you wont regret it 1010
