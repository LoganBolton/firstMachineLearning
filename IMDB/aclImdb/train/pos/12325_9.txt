i first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the bbc when i was working on uks 2000ad my pal steve parkhouse recorded it on vhs and sent it to me up till this point id really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by ridley scott coming out of hong kong this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui hark pronounced apparently choy hukbr br yet for all the smoky backlit exteriors and ambitious special effects stopmotion in a hong kong movie at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and elegance of joey wong granted joey is gorgeous but its her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism thats hard to analyse and though joey is now almost 20 years older gawd which of us isnt this will always be the enduring image of that actressbr br some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but theyre missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by pu songling around 1700 thats a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story just wanted to get that off my chestbr br for me chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale it has high tragedy because we know that chio sin and sin seen can never be together its about becoming mature for none of us can mature until weve experienced great loss its about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of true love and the comedy stylings of wu ma dont hurt a bit eitherbr br enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a filter of western culture and youll get on with it just fine
