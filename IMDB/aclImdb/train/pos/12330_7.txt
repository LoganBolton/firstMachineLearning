i just viewed this great goodnatured parody of night of the living dead and i have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent this movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery the supposable abandoned house the basement and the front lawn what i especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against cmon we know that toasters toaster ovens and ziplocks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread aside from the cheap acting and voiceovers this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of night of the living dead even better than night of the living dead of 1990br br i think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous another great reason why i love this movie is that there is no exception as to what bread is evil bagels are evil and even communions are evil which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest i think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread ie the car scene i think the end is very worth sticking aroundbr br even though this is a short and that night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part 2 in shocking 2d is debatably another great parody its still recommend as a great horror parody done by what seems to be college filmmakers i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of night of the living dead and still have respect for the filmmakers i would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves dmovies and horror parodys its just a wonderful little short horror film thats fun to watch and learn
