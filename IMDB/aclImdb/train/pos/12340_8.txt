there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnars mystical play farrell looks good in his title role but his line readings frankly stink this also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phonybr br there are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are perfect rose hobart as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose hobart in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her credit melfords stylish visual direction of the original her great beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earthbound sections of this moviebr br however one of borzages themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to the hot place hb warners performance here is as always perfectbr br so we have here a flawed but very interesting version i think that langs 1934 version is better as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel the watereddown musical remake but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance
