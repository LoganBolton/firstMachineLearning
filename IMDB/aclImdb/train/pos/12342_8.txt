the sea is watching was an interesting film experience first of all the overall feel was intense internalized claustrophobic and small each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside something very focused and not part of a bigger picture it was obvious what we were to look at in each frame the physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity the lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half and the tiny gate to the tiny settlement followed by the tiny and few cubbyholes that served as the establishments that made up what seemed to be the entire town even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass swaying in the wind no panoramic views in fact it reminded me of the montmarte sequence of moulin rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happeningbr br while the acting was passable considering i really could not discern how the lines were truly delivered i felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical why kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didnt seem true  people hadnt really changed that much and the character kikuno was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy taking on oshins business for naught the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting another example of odd acting was when the drunk boyfriend of kikuno showed up and ryosuke decided to intervene and was pushed down the stairs the way in which he got up and menacingly came up the stairs and the ensuing fight outside among the reeds was simply unsatisfying it wasnt that i like fight scenes  au contraire  but it seemed a little stilted and again overly dramaticbr br otherwise while not a beautiful movie to watch it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution as opposed to the geisha unfortunately perhaps it fed into our expectations of wanton women the honey  ill give you a deal comments supported by the overstretched actions and seriously caused me to doubt whether indeed 19th century prostitutes really acted in that way but once inside the house the inner workings became most interesting vivid and real and provided a scenario i never anticipated or imagined in my romantic view of japan in the 19th century
