artistically speaking this is a beautiful moviethe cinematography music and costumes are gorgeous in fact this movie is prettier than those directed by akira kurasawa himself in this case he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his deathbr br so as far as the writing goes the dialog was wellwritten and the story at times was interesting however the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some waysafter all its the story of a group of women who work in a brothel its interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan the women still long for a better life this reminds me a lot of the movie streets of shame though streets of shames characters are a lot less likable and more onedimensionalbr br so overall it gets a 7mostly due to everything but the writing its too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great kurasawa
