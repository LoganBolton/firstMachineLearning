this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old kurosawas works combined with dostoyevskis topics of human psychology oshin  sonia marmeladova  shakespeares drama and hans christian andersens tragic and cheerfulness the screenplay is wondrous the scenes are colour and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind the plot is interesting and unpredictable  each of the characters is very well developed and interesting  there is also a little action so if you dont like all the sentiments youd also come to your costs   it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them but about life work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa certainly worth seeing
