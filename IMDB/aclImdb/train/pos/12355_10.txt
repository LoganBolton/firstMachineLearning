i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledgebr br first of all those girls are not geisha but brothel tenants and one that dont know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the womens life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie ill suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is kurosawas work of is life and im sure that the director understood the silent meaning of kurosawas piece to the right intellectual range
