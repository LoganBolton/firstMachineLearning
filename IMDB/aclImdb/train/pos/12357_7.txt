i really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a weekbr br ms detmers nailed the performance  she was like a hungry cat on the prowl toying with her prey she lashes out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fianc√©s mothers pieces of fine china to the floor br br the film was full of beautiful touches the maserati the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the rooftops i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the recitation of antigonebr br it had a feeling of story of o  that is where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease  and why not what is to restrain a devil in the fleshbr br the whole movie is a real treat
