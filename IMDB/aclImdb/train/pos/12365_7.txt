im surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film the lions share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they differ in one version the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the brotherhood of the protectors a fictional splinter group of priests and brothers excommunicated by the church in the other version which ive seen only once on tv the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church meaning the archdiocese of new york or perhaps brooklyn also in the former version in most of the pertinent scenes the clerics are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say father soandso but the dubbed audio says brother soandso in the latter version i believe everyone is referred to as fatherbr br in any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial reshooting of the other with all brotherhood of the protector scenes reshot as archdiocese scenes or vice versa kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in godzilla i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv so no im not imagining this can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film
