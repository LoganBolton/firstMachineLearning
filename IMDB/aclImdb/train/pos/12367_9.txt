well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravos the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building thats a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if its a bit slow its a mix of the omen and rosemarys baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals its a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70s even if its nothing greatly original its wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 910
