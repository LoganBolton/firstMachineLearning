this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i dont care if its not the most well puttogether movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something nonformulaic and that i dont know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment
