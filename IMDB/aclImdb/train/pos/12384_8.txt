sigh i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner surely he isnt the avatar of subtlety as his films are practically always hardhanded and confronting but so what theyre awesomely entertaining his most famous action movies like the first three entries in the death wishseries for example are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres  like the religious horrors of the sentinel for example  he doesnt stand a chance with any of the critics the sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth pretty much the exact same controversy caused todds brownings masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years and why just because certain prudish and easily offended people who shouldnt watch the movie in the first place claim its an unethical thing to do i dont suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place another major reason why critics didnt warmly welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey konvitz novel  and thus michael winners screenplay  is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus according to the merciless pens of horror critics little more than pure plagiarism admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemarys baby the omen and the exorcist but lets face it 70s cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying 70s horrorhighlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery youre not likely to forget easybr br alison parker a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already alisons physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this its truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alisons brownstone apartment is the earths gateway to hell itself and shes the chosen one to guard it because the films script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly 75 minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alisons own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fiancées odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like alisons flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs the whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nailbiting denouements i ever witnessedbr br the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isnt the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin balsam and john carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others like christopher walken jeff goldblum beverly dangelo and tom berenger perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a mustsee for true genre fanatics
