man i really love the new dvd that universal put out ive never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy grainy vhs tapes for years unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs it sucksbr br anyway troubled fashion model alison parker cristina raines moves into haunted nyc brownstone only its more than just haunted its also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest john carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and archangels dont escape br br this has an all star cast full of oldtimey actors like ava gardner arthur kennedy jose ferrer etc as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken jeff goldblum whos voice was mysteriously overdubbed and tom berenger and you wont even recognize jerry orbach from law  order i had to do a doubletake when i didnt quite place where id seen him beforebr br nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead fathers rotting corpse thats been possessed by the devil and theres a neat ending where disfigured deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she wont be the next one to guard the portal it seems alisons troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinelbr br an excellent creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that shouldnt be missed i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedybr br 7 out of 10br br
