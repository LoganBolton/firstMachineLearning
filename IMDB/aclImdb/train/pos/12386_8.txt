the sentinel is one of the best horror movies already made in the movies industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartmentbr br the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is livingbr br i personally find the sentinel a very creepy movie and along with the exorcist they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alisons house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze its also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world
