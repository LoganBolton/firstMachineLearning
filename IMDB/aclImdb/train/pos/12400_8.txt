this is the second animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call artistic it contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes ive heard some complaints that this is antihuman or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i dont think thats true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we arent particularly accepting or openminded towards anyone different from ourselves id say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listenread there is also a welldone and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe andor science fiction in general 810
