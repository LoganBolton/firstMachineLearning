prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and happy vibes what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema with such examples as the chair waldermar korzeniowsky 1988 the green mile frank darabont 1999 alien 3 david fincher 1992and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised or at least thats what youd have thought prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and its somewhat of a shame that it isnt as well known as it should bebr br the film in short centres on an old prison well duh which has been reopened however its not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death and boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes i wont spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible handsbr br besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it its cast headlining we have lord of the rings peter jackson 20012003 star viggo mortensen and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his eastwoodesquire character is both badtothebone and likable a very delicate mix add him to a cast of heywaitaminuteiknowthatguy actors and youve got yourself one great set of stars the characters themselves however lack threedimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical weve got a black oculist a hardasnails prison warden a humanrights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters but in all honesty this fault actually aids the film instead of boring character development in an overlong equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on theres not a single scene thats a filler  its balls to the wall plot unlike a certain shawshank redemption frank darabont 1994  sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol slasher genre tradition prison punishes those who have been badbr br all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans dont be fooled into thinking itll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in usa 1980s its far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly donebr br i give it 35 out of 5 luvs a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
