this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script  the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding the gore is well done and used sparingly look out for the excellent barbedwire death  the action is punchy when used its true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget its hardly noticeable at all overall this is recommended trust me its better than it appears 810
