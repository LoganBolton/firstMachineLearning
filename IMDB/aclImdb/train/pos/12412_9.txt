what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films socould anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated prison is the finnish director harlins american debut which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison reopened for the cause of overpopulation in other more modern state penitentiaries inside the former execution dungeons the restless spirit of the electric chairs last victim still dwells around the now promoted warden eaton sharpe lane smith was there already 40 years ago when this innocent man was put to death and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the pastbr br prison contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but its the unbearably tense atmosphere thatll stick to you for certain unlike any other horror picture from that decade prison features an amazing sense of realism by this i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls of course and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well the films best parts are images of realistic and tough prisondrama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror the absolute best terrormoment providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age focuses on a grizzly deathstruggle involving barbed wire haunting the screenplay only suffers one flaw but thats a common onealmost inevitable i guess clichés the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding weve got the ugly fat pervert with his cute boytoy the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old n wise black con who serves a lifetime did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman dont stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise as there are so many other elements to admire the photography is dark and moist the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmateroles of class bactors are excellent the fans will recognize tom everett tom tiny lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder forget about wes cravens godawful attempt shocker or the downright pathetic cheeseflick the chair this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves hobbits and other fairy creatures this true 80s horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvdrelease
