with the mixed reviews this got i wasnt expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised its a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing thats breezy without being glib and a good pace it looks good too in a funky way apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and im one who liked it
