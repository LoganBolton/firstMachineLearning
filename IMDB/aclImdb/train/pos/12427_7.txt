this film has a lot of raw potential the script is sharp the dialogue is usually excellent though it could stand to lose the cheezy voiceovers the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good though some of the experimentation just doesnt work the main problem here is david duchovny once a geekboy always a geekboy and the sad simple fact is that hes incapable of playing anything but fox mulder he postures he tries to be slick he poses he tries to be macho in the end he just tries too hard he overplays his character he overspeaks his lines and hes just outplayed in all ways by timothy hutton and angelina jolie who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill timothy hutton was as always really good there was a spotty moment or two where he overdramatized his role but you could tell he was having fun with it he looked the part and he became the character both physically and atmospherically angelina jolie was also really good she didnt have much of a role in fact i though she could have used a much stronger oneher character wasnt nearly developed enough though she did remarkably well with what she had and the chemistry between her and hutton was apparent gee maybe thats why uma left him all in all it was rough around the edges but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles if david duchovny hadnt ripped his role to pieces it wouldve been that much better 710
