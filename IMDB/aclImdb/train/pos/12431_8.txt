okay truthfully i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking hutton jolie and duchovny how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolies natural power on the screen but surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss even davids humor matched up to jolies spark and fire as for hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with davids calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it 8 stars
