i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie which is why i left it unwatched for so long but i was very pleasantly surprisedbr br far from being a succession of silly gun battles and carboat chases it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails with nothing being overstated or overrationalizedbr br its likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that less time and effort was spent on finding everstupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching hell the biggest gun battle takes place off screen  and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise that adds to the suspense  whos winning whos dyingbr br alexandra staden might not be as dropdead gorgeous as monica vitti but few are and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire thats needed to make the character work  and the shape of her face her hair and her tall slender body could have been lifted straight from the comicstrip graphicsbr br nikolaj coasterwaldau was the perfect choice for a blaise badguy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch  even likable and i doubt id consider taking on many brutal psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies i cant think of a single one of hollywoods former waiters who could have pulled the role off that wellbr br fortunately blaise baddies always die in the end no spoilers there thats a really good thing because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes
