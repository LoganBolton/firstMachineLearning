for a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance it is done with style and class showing modestys early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world i think it is a very honesttrue portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter odonnell intended alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of coolintelligentinnocence and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role  much more believeable to have a new face creating the part im looking forward to the next film
