i was pleased to see that she had black hair ive been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the storiesbr br i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didnt spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as wellbr br i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the booksbr br i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
