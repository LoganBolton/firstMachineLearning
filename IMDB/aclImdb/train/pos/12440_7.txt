recap its business as usual at louches casino in tanger the casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day the owner louche and some staff leave for the night leaving modesty in charge suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino shooting wildly unknown to modesty they have already killed louche and are now after the money hidden in the vault but no one present and still alive at the casino knows the code to open the vault the vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants cant blow the door as planned suddenly modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters leader miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardybr br comments this is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about modesty blaise as i have neither seen nor read any of it the first point i like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified foremost i thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and miklos as the main plot sure there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the storybr br as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspensefilled scene is the game between modesty and miklos its an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tvseries and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such but i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action instead i enjoyed this game the history much more than a simple action moviebr br i think the two main stars alexandra staden and nikolaj coasterwaldau did very well staden especially portrays modesty very well and really carries this confident and talented characterbr br 710
