the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far its like a good pilot for a tvseries i even think its a little bit cult like with a lite touch of quentin tarantinos magic or something they have caught a great deal of modestys character but i admit missing willy garwin a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter odonnell im not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966 so i may have overrate this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise you should definitely see this one cant wait for a followup
