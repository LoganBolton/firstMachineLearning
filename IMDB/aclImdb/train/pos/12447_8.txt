theres a great deal of material from the modesty blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie unfortunately several attempts have been made and theyve fallen short of the great potential in the character so no this isnt the modesty you know from the comic strip currently reprinted in nice editions from titan books this is modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her backstory its accuratebr br miramax had the movie rights to the character with quentin tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser early drafts of the miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels but always managed to leave out some crucial element tarantino wasnt happy with any of them and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed to the studios credit they wanted to keep him in the process since they knew he got the character and her world with the movie rights close to expiration they decided to try a very different approach the result was my name is modesty a small directtovideo movie that introduces the characterbr br the movie does not introduce willie garvin or sir gerald these characters are important to blaises adventures throughout most of the published stories what this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself she never loses her composure and you never doubt that shes in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns most of the movie takes place within a casino which undoubtedly saved money on the production it doesnt matter the film does not come across as cheap instead it gives a fairly comprehensive and believable backstory for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead should miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now theyve laid out the characters background nicely and wont have to spend much time on her origin i realize the words directtovideo dont inspire confidence but this film is well worth a look
