first off im a dedicated fan of modestys and have been reading the comics since i was a child and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying but where they fail this one rocks br br well then here we go ms blaise is working for a casino a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives if the robber wins one round shell have to tell him about herself if she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free sounds stupid yeah well im not that good at explaining either br br she tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape living by natures own rules they hunt for food and he teaches her to read and fight as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for rebellions they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herselfbr br then she meets the man whos casino shes now working for and there the story ends br br what is to follow is that theres an awesome fight and the lines are totally cool alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise just as modest and strong graceful and intellectual as the comiconebr br feels awkward though too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but thats not relevant since the comic book blaise cant speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent not to mention that its weird everybodys speaking english in the balkanbr br the acting is really good even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud br br my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robbers ass totally awesome d i cant wait until the real adventure begins in the next moviesbr br watch it you wont be disappointed
