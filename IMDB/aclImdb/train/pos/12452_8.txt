if you are already a fan of peter odonnells wonderful modesty blaise books from the sixties you will really enjoy this movie if you have ever seen the 1966 modesty blaise film forget it that was camp this is the real modesty blaise the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love its a long way from joe loseys 1966 travesty and it takes our modesty quite seriously alexandra staden is quite good and believable in the part and yes we do get to see her kick butt chucklebr br this is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty her childhood and her days with lobbr br since peter odonnell was the creative consultant on the movie everything really rings true even the story odonnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it having read all the books i enjoyed the movie even more for thatbr br now that miramax has kept their option on the property by having quentin tarrentino make this film i do hope to see more of the modesty stories asap especially as the wonderful character of willie garvin makes modestys character really come alive to that end i really hope the film does well in europe i have no idea if miramax intends to ever distribute the dvd in the usa i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general distribution i wonder how miramax decides where and how to distribute its filmsbr br in the story modesty is in her early 20s working at louches casino in tangier the flashback sequences are artfully done and take modesty from about 9 years old through her teens up to her current age in the movie  about 2122 id guess i really dont think theres a perfect actress for modesty for many of us modesty fans shes much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already alexandra staden is credible she is very slim graceful and poised she has lots of closeups she has a great face  one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over according to o donnells illustrator romero modesty has rather a fuller figure than staden but im willing to overlook that if staden continues in the role i think she will mature into it  just as modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older staden already conveys modestys humor and absolute assurance very well go ahead and rent this movie its not like anything else youve seen and even though it was directed by scott spiegel it is full of tarrentino touches great camera moves lighting and welldone action sequences
