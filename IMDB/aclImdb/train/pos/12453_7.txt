unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for imdb equate low budget with not good whatever else this movie might need more budget really isnt part of it big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another lara croft movie what we have here is a step or two better than thatbr br the nearly unknown alexandra staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty and this is crucial for this movie to work her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable and you find yourself wishing that the camera wont leaver her face it makes it workable that the bad guy nikolai played by also little known in the us at least nikolaj coasterwaldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her something modesty can exploit she is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out stop wasting my time then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen making a scene like that plausible doesnt happen by accidentbr br probably the biggest problem i have with the railthin staden playing modesty is it just isnt very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like coasterwaldau and beat him she just aint a peta wilson or a pumpedup hilary swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch coasterwaldau letting himself be overpowered by staden looks like hes just roughhousing with his little sisterbr br since this is not really an action film this isnt a big flaw i just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels
