i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i dont remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i dont think ive seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great the performances were topgrade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that ill be able to see every episode before i wrap this up id like to say that ill always remember this show in my memory forever even though i dont think ive seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
