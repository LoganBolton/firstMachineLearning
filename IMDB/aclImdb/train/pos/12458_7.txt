utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a dropdead gorgeous blonde acting as pullstring doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling latenight feature this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat antiheroes alain delon and charles bronson really they dont get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy midsection where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with 10000 possible combinations oh fun but this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronsons characters after a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each others involvement and have a mutual respect this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curveball still their encounters early on suggest theres more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that what just happen there ending that might just make you jump yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh glad to get that out of the system br br the pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension watch as the same process is repeated over and over again and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous but the climax payoff is haunting the taut complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good but there are some neat novelties coins glass and liquidsÂ… try not spilling and visual symbolisms jean hermans direction is efficiently sophisticated and lowkey but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere the sound fx features more as a potent note than that of francois deroubaixs funky score thats mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening top drawers delon whos quite steely and bronson a jovial turn are solid and work off each tremendously bernard fresson chalks up the attitude as the inspector who knows theres more going on than what is being led on an attractive female cast features able support by brigitte fossey and olga georgespicot br br a cryptically directionless but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions
