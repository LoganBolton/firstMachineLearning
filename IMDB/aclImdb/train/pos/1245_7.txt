whenever i see most reviews its called a misfire for eddie murphy these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff hes doing these days and maybe soften their stance in retrospect the golden child is not highbrow entertainment but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clich√©s and gives murphy one of his best roles i dont understand the pervading lack of love for its efforts at all perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout thrillaminute adventures steven spielberg started it with indiana jones its unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless theres nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trendsbr br yes its silly but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that ridiculous is where hollywoods idea of mysticism begins and ends whats more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride
