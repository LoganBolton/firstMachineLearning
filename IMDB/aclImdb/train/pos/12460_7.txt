farewell friend aka adieu lamihonour among thieves isnt perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault one to return stolen bonds the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend naturally things arent quite that simple even after they open the vault leading to some neat twists and turns on the debit side theres a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park bronson has a very irritating fonzielike catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments brigitte fossey sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is something of a liability  her ill cook spaghetti ill learn to make love well ill read shakespeare speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways  and its a shame about the horrible last lineshot but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number thats worth checking out if you can find a decent printbr br cinema clubs uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed thats no great problem especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality
