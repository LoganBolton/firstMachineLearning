i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in 1978 and is a very gripping read pun not intended its not too difficult to read for those out there that dont read often so dont be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the 70s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class its a precious piece of melbourne history its a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80s soft porn movie its far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in 1982 so dont expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it its also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and its great watching her really acting for if youre close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story
