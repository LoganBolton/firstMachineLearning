ok this movie starts out like a cheesy lifetime movie and doesnt get better till almost well through the movie the script is full of cheese and fluff and cast is not well directed for the most part for the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves i do not think this is one of her best acting jobs the only reason i bought the movie is because it was on sale and had ellen burstyn in it shes terrific but this is also not one of her best acting gigs the story is based on true events and that helps the movie actually i didnt even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when i saw stills of the balloon traveling i meanlet it get where its suppose to go and be done with it but all is forgiven by the time it does reach its destination and the story comes to a close if this doesnt bring a tear to your eye nothing will its cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again
