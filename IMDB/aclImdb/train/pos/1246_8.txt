the premise may seem goofy but since murphys character doesnt take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modernday hardboiled child abduction excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his 80s peak in comedyaction theres also some great fx a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look
