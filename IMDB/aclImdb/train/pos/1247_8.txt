i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative critiques that ive read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr murphys great comedic style you have to keep in mind that golden child is a fantasy film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the real world during the time this film was released i was working in a video rental store this was one of the most popular with all our customers every single time we put this one up on our monitor all the copies we had went out fast with waitlist requests that kept it on the queue for months everyone who rented it loved it i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them i really feel that this film is a sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later yes i did buy this film for my own video library i adored the little boy who played the golden child  j l reate  but after looking at his profile in imdb i noticed that he never did any more films that is sad because he definitely had an onscreen aura and could have continued with a film career i also adored victor wong who played the old man i loved him in his part as egg shen in big trouble in little china  1986 at any rate this was a great film the only drawbacks that didnt seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more adult in nature  such as chandlers rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette it was funny but it still was out of sync ok so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mindset of the day perhaps this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now thats entertainment
