ok so i dont watch too many horror movies  and the reason is films like dark remains i caught this on a surprisingly featurefilled dvd and it scared me silly in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pantsbr br however the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised id only really seen about 10 of it the rest of the time id been watching the pizza on my coffee table  nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up againbr br the filmmaking is solid and the characters situation was really compelling the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jumpbutton  its merely a woodland a cabin and a disused jail  and a lot of darkness most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multimillion dollar production the makeup effects really looked like it was also its obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of filmmaking the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done i noticed online that this film won the la shriekfest  a really major achievement and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers clear talent  and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed tobr br turn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend  order a pizza
