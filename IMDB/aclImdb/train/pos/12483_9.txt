although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me im not that easy you might say that im biased about the film and ok i am but i didnt see the finished product until 12272006 and was extremely pleased im not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesnt then it does it will keep you completely off balance i would suggest watching the movie first then the directors notes and special features it is so well written directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurences future projects
