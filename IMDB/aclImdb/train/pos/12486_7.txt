well this film is a difficult one really to be straight with you this film doesnt contain much of a riveting story nore does it make u want to know how itll endbut ill tell you something nownever have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills to be fair i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why i was jumpyor maybe its because this film does deliver in that aspect its basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountainsall looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors i think its its the sister of the main character and she brings along her husbandduring the night the husband hears noiseschecks it out and thats when things start to go really really wrongthey dont stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isnt rightto cut a long story shorteventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care ofbr br its not a hollywood blockbuster nore does it have a huge budget but please dont let that put you off its creepy tense and very very jumpy just give it a try
