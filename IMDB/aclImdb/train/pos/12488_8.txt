im not at all picky about horror movies and im willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesnt mean that im willing to rewatch many of them or that i wont have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent doublebill with session 9br br i should specify before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i cant vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger groupbr br after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death  this is one of the rare movies that doesnt shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the moviebr br the couple is not doing well the wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting  one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and thats legitimate hes trying to give her more direction its a role that men sometimes take onbr br there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly nonviolent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressingbr br moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video
