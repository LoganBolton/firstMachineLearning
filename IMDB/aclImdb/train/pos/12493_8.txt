after all the crap that hollywood and the indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments there are some clich√©d moments but im not sure its possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie theres not much new hereits just done wellbr br make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often this is not a movie to watch while youre eating pizzabr br theres one very wellwritten red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorlycast role cheri christian just doesnt make an effective julie the wifemother for one thing shes totally unsympathetic i know i knowshes just gone through a traumatic experience but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but i never didbr br finally a thumbsup for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resistedbr br this is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a good oldfashioned scary moviesomething thats rather rare nowadays
