whats good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan doesnt rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if youve seen everything theres still a few things in this film that will make your jaw dropbr br what could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shotonvideo quality in some places thoughit mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless closeups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed itbr br still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental
