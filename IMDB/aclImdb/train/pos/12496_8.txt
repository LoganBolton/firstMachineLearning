for years weve been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull hollywood retreads like saw 2 to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like dark remainsbr br we managed to catch a screening of this film at shriekfest 2005 the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best filmbr br while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category the acting and cinematography are top notch but its the direction that makes this film worth the view the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scaresbr br the editing and visual fx are also top notch and while many horror films dont manage to use music to their benefit the score for dark remains only adds to its creepinessbr br i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals but none have been near me so i cant wait to hear when itll finally be coming out on dvd trust me even if youre sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you wont regret it
