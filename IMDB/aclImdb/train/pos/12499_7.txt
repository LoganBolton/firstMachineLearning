i always feel strange and guilty saying it because im a fairly welleducated nonteenager but i actually sort of like the olsen twins and i respect the movies they make even though ive never really been their target audience when in rome was a traditional marykate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a b storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in rome and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything theyre not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointedbr br that said those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves for those of us whove watched them since the first episodes of full house its really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember 10 downing street from winning london and the visit to the louvre from passport to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole familybr br as long as i still feel like im on my soapbox and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins in order to be a fan of the olsen twins you dont have to be some preteen valley girl from california in fact thats not really the target audience if it were the mka fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through gap or some store like that not walmart when in rome while it does feature high fashion and globetrotting and two girls from a valley in cali isnt really about that its more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it thats called marketingyou take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least theyre sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial br br basically dont knock the film until youve seen it and then dont knock it until youve tried to understand what the olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids  enjoy parents  do the same if you like the olsen twins you wont be disappointed
