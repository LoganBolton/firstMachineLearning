contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riskbr br i loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundbr br one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepybr br the use of text in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmbr br the use of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo järegård is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itbr br the voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place to bebr br the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do
