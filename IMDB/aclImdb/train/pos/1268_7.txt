just cause takes some of the best parts of three films cape fear a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a filmbr br sean connery is a liberal law professor married to a former assistant district attorney kate capshaw and hes a crusader against capital punishment blair underwoods grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandsons appeal hes sitting on death row for the murder of a young girlbr br when connery arrives in this rural florida county hes up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne whos about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil br br later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence hes uncovered hes feeling pretty good about himself at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fearbr br to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly the cast uniformly turns in some good performances special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises hes been basing his convictions on many a confirmed liberal ive known has come out thinking quite differently once theyve become a crime victimbr br of course the reverse is equally true many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteedbr br criminal justice is not an end but a process and a never ending one at that for all society i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it
