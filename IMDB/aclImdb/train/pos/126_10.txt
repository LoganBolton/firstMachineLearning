zentropa is the most original movie ive seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days von triers followups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor its too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future its hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but its everyones loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead
