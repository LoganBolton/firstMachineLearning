enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isnt much detail perhaps had they shown flashbacks or somethingbr br anyway it is still a good movie that id watch again 710br br
