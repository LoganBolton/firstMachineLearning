the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous selfdesctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh atsympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked bestbr br simon geist is a man in his late 30searly 40s who creates a popculture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitchslap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his livein female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the musicvideo queen for a bunch of brated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indieart house crowd mark my wordsbr br
