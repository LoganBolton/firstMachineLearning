this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings especially when you think that this is zukovics first large scale attemptbr br one warning do not take the movies message that seriously it is not for mass consumption  and that is not a compliment the message is a somewhat stylized postcollege neophyte view of societybr br i did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the 90s
