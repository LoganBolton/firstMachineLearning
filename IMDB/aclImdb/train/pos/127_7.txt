zentropa has much in common with the third man another noirlike film set among the rubble of postwar europe like ttm there is much inventive camera work there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesnt really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the nativesbr br but id have to say that the third man has a more wellcrafted storyline zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dreamnightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect br br this movie is unrelentingly grimnoir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine grim but intriguing and frightening
