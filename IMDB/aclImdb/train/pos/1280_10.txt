i was lucky enough to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and was smacked so hard with what i saw i returned the next night for its second of three screenings a funny savage and sharptoothed attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment passively swallowed without tasting by the lowestcommondenominator target audience waged by a loneavenger journalist who slowly takes in members for his guerillawar on predictability is what the movies all about and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that youre left after the credits roll with hope renewed and excited that original films can still be made anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to light up their imaginations would do well to hunt and i do mean hunt this scarcelyseen item down for fans of fight club and any charlie kaufman film and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabid dog
