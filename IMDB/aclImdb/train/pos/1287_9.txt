lets bowl started out on local television in the twin cities it came on late at night something youd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of hammsbr br even the ads were locally produced featuring wally outside grumpys bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously  ahhover to you steve sedahl not sure why but that one always made me laughbr br there was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips sedahl played it straight counterbalanced by rich kronfelds bizarre and hilarious wally hotvedt highlights included segments like how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball chuck them into a lake and tips on dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and wally ends with the bitter complaint i could have done that myself br br another segment  what the duo did on their days off  featured steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while wally struggled to climb the cliffs at taylors falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and oversized headphones hilarious br br wallys awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlightsbr br lets bowl was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ernie the pig butch etc were more distractions than anything else the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced even jon stewart dissed lets bowl on the daily show  not enough lame snide jokes  an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far betterbr br how often does a lets bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap the networks have the total crap part down cold but its a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like lets bowl br br heres hoping theyll put it out on dvd
