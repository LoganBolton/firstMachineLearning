yeah i remember this one many years since i actually watched it the story was entirely surreal but nonetheless great what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at its the same with first kid which follows a similar pattern certain movies  like this one here  just aim at plain and comical nonsense such movies cant be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer of course these movies lack quality lack a sophisticated storyline very often lack firstclass acting but if they do fulfil their primary premise  thats okay i dont have this movie here on my list of alltime favorites but i still thought it was funny had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway
