the book on which this movie is based was excellent it took a while to come to grips with houellebecqs unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the authors world of sadness in fact no other book has affected me so much this is not necessarily a good thing  it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept houellebecqs insights are masterfully captured by harel and the heros apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed this is a movie which reveals todays society for the lowly male in all its horror hopefully things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the ratrace as shown in this movie its probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again one is enough for any man
