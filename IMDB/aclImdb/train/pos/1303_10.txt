eric clapton jack bruce and ginger baker reunite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called cream those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it all skinny very long hair wild clothes and loud music they played a combination of rock and blues and it was for the most part good stuffbr br well these guys are now 60something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us i was always extremely familiar with clapton of course who has never been out of the limelight but i didnt know what to expect from bruce and baker neither of whom i hadnt seen in decades they surprised me when he was young baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death now he looks healthy in shape and his drum playing was solid bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what theyre doingbr br some people criticized this show for being lowkey i dont agree with that i have no complaints the concert sounded very good the second song spoonful was outstanding the highlight of the concert for mebr br highly recommended
