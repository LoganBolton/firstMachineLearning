okay yes this was a verytightbudget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burntout part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been onset the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast  yaint that fast
