an unusually straightfaced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously imperfect as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving its one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax 2 or more max or whatever they call it you end up watching 40 minute blocks when youre supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker 2 chopping mall and the assault a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow lowbudget brethern who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he actuallys interested in the material ie dont bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title actors whove had too little to do recently mancuso ford even gary sandy for chrissakes really put their all into some of their best roles in years  as for grieco he has the right look although his acting is a bit onenote  its clear his character is supposed to be selfdestructing throughout the film but grieco doesnt quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote sorority house massacre 2  dinosaur island for the director  both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger cormonlike cinema  this ones more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan bpictures of the 70s  giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time  a real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive but a wellwritten characterdriven aboveaverage straighttovideo actioner small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called heatseeker the other night  this lowbudget stuff isnt as easy as it looks  but thats another story
