i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasnt a big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked twister and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks fromme give it a chance it wont let you down
