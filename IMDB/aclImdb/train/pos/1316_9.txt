i just finished viewing this finely conceived and beautifully acteddirected movie it was nip and tuck as to whether i was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the lifetime movie network because of the horribly distracting commercials reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot after all the worst that could happen would be that i might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads so why did i watch it mainly because when imdb gives a movie a weighted average of 58 whos statistical average was 73 it must be a sure hitbr br i was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie commercial pox and all helen hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each rolebr br the portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed when the scene calls for quick witted timely delivered verbal intercourse she can stand toe to toe with any actor yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language without the commercials which by design kill the continuity of any good film this would have been a real edgeoftheseat nailbiter i gave it a 90
