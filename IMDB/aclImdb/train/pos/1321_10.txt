beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature forbidden lie2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouris book forbidden love and that was a bestseller an onionpeeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie is the very best in editorialised reality tvbr br cleverly edited and colourful broinowskis storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke i disagree with variety that its overlong instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others justrecorded testimonials on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes miredso i watched it twicebr br this oscarworthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouris friends and fans clearly these friends are now turned the funniest oncamera line belonging to khouris qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat nononsense colloquialisms i think its a load of sht personallybr br we need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers any perennial liespinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie br br theres some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian who instead presses her conartist repeatedly for corroborationbr br since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication khouri has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name she absconded supposedly because a shes either terrified of her sly moreitaliansoundingthangreek husband or b because she needed her passportvisas to clear her name br br unlikelybr br a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no not jordan according to a closing card khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007br br i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge instead the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen once they caught on there was plenty counterderision and catcalls earlier stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didnt know how to take khouris evolving contradictionsbr br the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything outnot even her own selfsacrificebr br anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at firstkey to how a lifelong liar operates in halftruths khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yrold with rather disarming charm and surprisingly workedout bicepsbr br gradually were introduced to lessandlessadulating aussie journos publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouris honourkilling accusations hook line and sinker later we see their more rueful reactions quite selfcontrolled and matteroffact if some perhaps a little bitterbr br it was jordanian antihonourkilling activists who took deepest umbrage at khouris fallacies because its potstirring forced them to reduce the pace of change honourkillings do happen in jordan its just their prevalence thats at odds with khouris bookplus 72 other facts in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakinglychecked objectionsbr br the publishing houses across 4 continents whod jumped at the chance to publish firsttime author khouri never tried to check any facts leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract they too were fair game so a massive hottopic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafesbr br later still were shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouris bio as well for one thing shes not only not a 35yrold virgin her defence is that she merely didnt disabuse people of their assumptions but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers sometimes shes just too fasttalking in her american accent she also seems toocomfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who dont need any western paternalism from me but when even cultural cues dont jibe in addition to khouris facts youve got to start questioning your sourcebr br at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account in person in jordan the last third is consumed with a factfinding trip back to amman where one fact after another falls eventually broinowski forces her conartist to admit the decadediscrepancy in her story and its after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera secret because in it khouris american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent hes an actor we never find out how anna uncovered it br br so this becomes the filmmakers triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment her oncamera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt fbi documentsand khouris most shocking initial crimebr br anna broinowski watchlist her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players crosscommenting on footage to kill two birdsmaking her audiences want to drink from the same well againbr br in fact despite her deceptively demure approach she made me reconfirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their norma khouri investigationbr br broinowski made me look1010
