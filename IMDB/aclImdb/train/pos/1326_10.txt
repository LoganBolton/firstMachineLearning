i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70s  i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video finally its out it was made in brazil so i assumed that was why it hadnt made it to video yet i have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out it is one of my alltime favorites  but be warned it is weird like werner herzog weird  its weirdness stems from its superrealismbr br the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago in precolonial times when europeans were first encountering the tribes in the amazon a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy so they intend to kill him before they dispatch him though they make him part of their tribe their custom the entire movie is like watching a national geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe thats it cosmic plotline no intense insight into the variety of human life definitelybr br oh yeah be warned this film has definite nudity  this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble savages this film tells it like it was reread above national geographic superrealismbr br
