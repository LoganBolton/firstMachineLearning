i love this movie very much i watched it over and over i dont see why anyone would think this movie wasnt good maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it it might be a little like pretty woman but i havent seen that and i dont think its any better than this i dont know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie and to those who say its not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people dont like it as for rani mukherjee  i think thats how you spell her last name she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever
