thre isnt a single scorsese movie id place on a list of my favorite movies but this is the best thing ive run through my dvd player in about five years scorseses patient elucidation of favorite film moments and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious calm and intelligent br br its 3 dvdsides worth of material it would have to be a british production since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet methodical no frills putthefocusonthecontent approach that is taken here and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies you should love the movies you do for personal idiosyncratic and specific reasons not just more metoo votes for the godfather etc people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies if they did movies would be more interesting than they are scorsese does know what ideas are being explored and that makes him a compelling involved speaker on the topic i really appreciate his articulate generous interviews over the last decadebr br on a negative note scorsese is best when hes excited to show you some obscure movie rather than when hes didactically teaching you something wellestablished about film history and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose its very distracting
