in anne of green gables 1934 marilla cuthbert helen westley and matthew cuthbert op heggie middleaged siblings who live together at green gables a farm in avonlea on prince edward island decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm but the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named anne shirley dawn evelyn parisa veteran of disneys series of alice shorts who later would adopt her characters name br br anne was only 11 in lucy maude montgomerys source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story the movie suffers somewhat from this concession as many of annes reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an elevenyearold that from a teenager as in the book anne is bright and quick eager to please but dissatisfied with her name her build her freckles and her long red hair being a child of imagination however anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of prince edward islandbr br in fact anne is the original teenage drama queen and the films screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy a change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists br br since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the montgomerys story i can see no reason to take issue with the changes but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation the comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest selfreflexive parodies of hollywood conventions the actress anne shirley was one of hollywoods all time beauties and the film is in black and white so much of the amusement is in seeing the title characters endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard br br tom brown does a nice job as annes love interest gilbert blythe and sara haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the cuthberts pompous neighbor br br then again what do i know im only a child
