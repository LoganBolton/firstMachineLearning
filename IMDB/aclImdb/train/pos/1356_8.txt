i started watching the apprentice about 4 years agomaybe 5 and i really really liked it the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core is still very entertaining donald trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well but the best part of the show is new york city mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character unto itself the jazz tunes coupled with some great camerawork make new york look spectacularbr br the apprentice will easily alway make my top 3 reality shows of all timethe amazing race is no 1howeverbut just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fastthe same case as with tarstar world the broadcasters in this country did a bang up job in presenting the show the first three seasons were shown in a row then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown which kept the concept freshbr br in conclusion you will love this show especially the first 2 seasons however if you keep watching the show continuously thereafter its charm will wear off and fast
