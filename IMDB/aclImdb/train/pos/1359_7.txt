i work in a library and expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago well i liked parker posey a lot shes a wonderful actress and omar townsend was really cute as her boyfriend he couldnt act but when you look like him who cares but the movie was bad it wasnt funny or cute or much of anything posey kept the movie afloat with her energy but she learned the dewey decimal system overnight and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music come on also i did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a fullfledged librarian at the endhair in a bun glasses no sense of humorcan we let that stereotype go please worth seeing for posey and townsend but thats about it the tv series was much better
