myself and my groovadelic 20something pals just cant get enough of this awesome parker posey classic i tried renting this on dvd but cant seem to find it  too bad as im sure the features would be extra special   we all highly recommend this ubercool comedy flickerino for a date or even just a cozy night home alone this would also be the purrfect type of movie to watch with your cat or even throw a party based on like a party girl party just like the one in the movie that the lovable huggable squeezable parker posey goes to at the end oh and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending move aside the sixth sense youve just been outdone by a way radder movie sorry no offense just calling it like it is take it from an old flick lover comedy just doesnt get better than party girl with parker p feel it yours ronald marie macdougall aka dj cyberrap
