okay this has been a favourite since i was 14 granted i dont watch it multiple times a year anymore but this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message this movie is fun its pretty dated almost passe but parker posey is so brilliant that its unbelievable if you want to be charmed by a 90s breakfast at tiffanys attended 90s raves or love parker this movie is for you otherwise dont bother
