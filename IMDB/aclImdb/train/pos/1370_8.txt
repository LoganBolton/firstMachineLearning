i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker poseys performance and the movie was pretty good also for anyone whos spent a little too much time in the nightclubafterhours scene this movie will have a special charm for you not too serious mostly funny and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gembr br i especially liked the diaz character reminded me of every single struggling dj ive ever known and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about itbr br babaganoosh
