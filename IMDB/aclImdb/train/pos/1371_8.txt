this film is a delightful light hearted look at both sides of where the club kid rave scene blends with the new york art music and performance art worlds with a cameo by the omnipresent miss bunny this is torch song trilogy for the perkypostteen girls that girl for our disaffected affected millennium timesbr br the dialogue is fast and funny and parker poseys costumer deserves  if not an academy award at least  a stadium wave of kudosbr br of course this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey and she is perfectly cast like a lot of her acting work it may not be very deep it is often selfreferential and well posey but it all works she is a talented comedienne an incredible entertainer and this film entertains she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap and never lets it drop to the floorbr br mary is a superficial party fashionista who isnt above stealing designer clothing from a friends closet or making out with someone elses boyfriend on a deeper level this is a story of a girl and her friends who are careless in every sense of the word including about other people and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life br br the script is beautifully crafted witty and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt in a role that was much too onedimensional and heavy handed a more nuanced performance from her would have deepened the relationship between the two but hey this is comedy a surprisingly deep role that gives this film some substance and world vision is the fallafel selling boyfriend we should all be so lucky is he the one for mary or the one that gets away br br i rate this as a 8 because it isnt a great moment of film history it is not a classic and it is not great art all of which get deeper and richer on reviewing like desperately seeking susan it represents something very true about its time period but may become irrelevant with time still it has everything an entertaining film needs and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone
