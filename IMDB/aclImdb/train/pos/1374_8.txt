a french film ester williams would love but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves no question where sciammas sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as animaux but actually only the 3 girls are in focus and for the entire time with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background marie is a stick of a girl unattractive but determined she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane  a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer and she is also a friend of convenience to anna not unattractive but for her the time of her bodys perfection was short and now she is an adolescent in a womens body what ensues is a journey to selfrealization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is unnatural where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth while the d√©nouement was breath taking with florianes selfabsorption beautifully portrayed as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne it all seemed abstract sciammas puppets
