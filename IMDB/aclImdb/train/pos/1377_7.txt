in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls the three principals all unknown to me give very surefooted performances the kind in fact that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldnt be too surprised if they are not heard from again it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where theres just an outside chance it might speak to the bubblegum crowd it isnt aimed at
