after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had Â£399 in my wallet  thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie  saw this and gave it ago  im glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identitybrian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman 2 the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthews name and that made me get it and no his part isnt big at all its very short at the very end of the film its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but its watchable
