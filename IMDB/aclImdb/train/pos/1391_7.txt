considering it was made on a low budget the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects workbr br the story involves a family who are about to move into their solarpowered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california only to find it trashedby motorcycle vandals they think but their youngest daughter natasha ryan has begun to see mysterious thingsa green pyramid strange humanoid figures etc and only recently the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies thus the family led by jim davis and dorothy malone finds themselves facetoface with strange alien forces who have put them in a timeandspace warpbr br mixing in elements of 2001 a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind the day time ended despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen the desert setting is very appropriate for this films close encounters and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubricks or spielbergs films the day time ended is much better than many other 2001close encounters knockoffs i give credit to director john bud cardos whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia for at least tryingand on that basis i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10
