bizarre trippy forgetaboutastoryandfullsteamahead low budget scifi about the williams family living in the california desert they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness apparently theyve been caught in a timespace warp where past present and future collidebr br this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects  a constant light and sound show dinosaurlike creatures that have at each other a friendly and tiny little et who enchants the granddaughter and so on this picture does show off a little imagination if nothing elsebr br very nice music by richard band engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen randall william cook and peter kuran and importantly a likable family are key assets it generates a sense of childlike amazement it may very well be that its more of a romp for kids or the kids inside many of us who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentationbr br i found it hard to resist its a short and sweet 80 minutes diversion and a decent credit for director john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders fame and executive producer charles bandbr br 710
