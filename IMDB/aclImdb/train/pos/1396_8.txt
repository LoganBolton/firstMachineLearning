probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful dramatic episode in this case the superb balance of terror with a lighter affair shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of scifi and while the formula isnt quite right yet in this entry the true triumph is trouble with tribbles in season 2 the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the sillinessbr br diverting from the shows tradition the enterprise isnt on any proper mission in this episode instead kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty a well deserved break after three months of incessant work the earthlike planet a budgetrelated fact is very appealing but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens dr mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carrolls work soon other people begin experiencing similar things a woman meets a don juanlike character sulu has a runin with a samurai and kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy throw in a freakishly reallooking tiger and its easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out whats going on before anybody gets hurtbr br the idea is a classic one idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly the episodes humorous take on the topic is rather successful werent it for a dark turn of events that doesnt sit well with the rest of course everything works out fine again come the end and the casts general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves most notably and ironically the otherwise hilarious william shatner and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new previously unseen things the definition of star treks successbr br 7510
