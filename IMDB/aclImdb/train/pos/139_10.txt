first of all riget is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange dogma style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately theres no the end as for me its unacceptable i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse and i have some idea i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different im sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldnt be the same so heres my suggestion mayble little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with riget3 i think the only solution here is to create puppetdriven animation like for example team america by trey parker or even computer 3d animation i know its not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way its possible to make actors alive again for riget fans this shouldnt be so big difference  if the animation will be done in good way average watcher will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story its completely understandable that its not possible to create riget 3 with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation just dreamsbr br i hope to see riget 3 someday or even to see just the script im curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here dobr br greets slajbr br ps im not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king
