hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla  it works perfectly caine  his team of assistants celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human he manages to persuade his team to help him  the procedure works well  caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails  he remain invisible the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory but then again hes invisible right he can do anything he wantsbr br directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man you know its just after christmas i saw this a few hours ago on late nightearly morning cable tv  worst of all i feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates  fizzy pop ive had over the past week so ill keep this one brief the script by andrew w marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle  has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man 1933 film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror scifi  action  provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes i thought the characters were ok i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think its generally known that verhoeven doesnt deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team  then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification whos going to know that caine says to himself then of course theres the gore he shows a rat being torn apart  thats just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty  sadistic tone about it having said that i love horrorgoreexploitation films so hollow man delivers for me its just that it might not be everyones cup of teabr br director verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular  moreorless flawless their brilliant  its as simple  straight forward as that theres some good horror  action setpieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little overthetop i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs  bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla theres a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike  someone has their head busted open with blood splattering resultsbr br with a staggering budget of about 95000000 hollow man is technically faultless i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacons entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldnt they the acting was ok bacon made for a good mad scientist antihero type guybr br hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects  action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or characters but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier  darker streak than the usual hollywood product definitely worth a watch
