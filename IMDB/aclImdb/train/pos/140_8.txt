normally i dont like series at all theyre all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fastbr br these series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mindbr br the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
