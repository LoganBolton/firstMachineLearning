i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed i generally like to see documentaries but i cant remember to have seen one that is better than earth i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random browsing i also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores running on the displayed high definition tvs after seeing the movie its obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and multimedia retail managers its just so awesome and spectacular that you cant help but stare on the screen no matter if youre generally interested in nature documentaries or notbr br without hesitating a 10 out of 10 for sure there are more thrilling movies but in regard of documentaries earth is definitely one of the best of its genre
