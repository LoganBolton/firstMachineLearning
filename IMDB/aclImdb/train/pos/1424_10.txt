rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to planet earth of course planet earth is better  it has much much more of the same earth is like an extended trailer for the planet earth series and as such is inevitably inferior and simplified but that is not comparing like with likebr br as a featurelength documentary or actually as a featurelength anything it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life unless you choose to traverse the earth in helicopters with longrange cameras for years on end and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth which  lets face it  is unlikelybr br on the narration yes everyone in the uk  very much including me  adores david attenborough and theres little excuse for him not to be narrating here but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three he wasnt a presenter on planet earth just a narrator and im sure hes modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a good thingbr br anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe majesty and glory all reviewers agree on that those who love it ie everyone willshould go on to see an buy planet earth so three cheers for its cinematic release and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on dvd rather than the planet earth boxset but as works of art theyre not in competition here peoplebr br the earth is big enough for both
