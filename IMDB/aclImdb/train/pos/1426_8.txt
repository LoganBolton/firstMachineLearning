i have to say that sometimes looks are all that matters just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out not about our earth though but he is right anywaybr br and when it comes to looks this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to seebr br and then theres the personality of the movie as well interesting with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed imagesbr br the movie probably wont affect your lifestyle ruining these beauties but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly isbr br this movie deserves its 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
