ive heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television miniseries planet earth narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough nevertheless whether it was screened down here in australia or not i never caught up with it and when i happened upon the opportunity to see earth 2007  a featurelength compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen i jumped at the chance the theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though i had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet earth for 90 minutes i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times earth is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinctionbr br though the film directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on earth i hear that the original miniseries which ran for eleven episodes delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems but i think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i cant remember the last time that i felt so inspired and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals anthropomorphising them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedybr br earth is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the lifesaving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predatorprey interactions though occasionally perhaps to cater towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature and the raw instinct that fuels these animals final hopeless efforts at survival theres even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slowmotion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep or the majestic midair leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own speciesbr br aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing highdefinition timelapse photography throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it consequently earth left me thirsting for more and fortunately i now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd boxset for planet earth uplifting and tearjerking aweinspiring and heartrending earth is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007
