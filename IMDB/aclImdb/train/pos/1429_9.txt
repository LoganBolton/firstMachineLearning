i loved the way earth is made its photography is unbelievable editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewarts voice over is perfect in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you dont want to miss you really are on a journey to where you would probably neverever end up by yourself br br and although at first i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival i could not help laughing myself sometimes nature simply seems too impressive to comprehendbr br but rather than the need to laugh i left the cinema with a profound questionhowcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of yearsbr br with this question in mind youll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing earth i felt the immediate need to change the world to help all these animals in their struggle to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once all that not being a ngo activist at allbr br so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our still fantastic planet and the polar bear from its depressing fate wwwloveearthcombr br i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went throughbr br i hope that cutting on my energyuse will do i dont know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted statebr br an inspiring film it is but i didnt leave the cinema feeling very happy
