second part actually episode 48 of the hit danish tvseries is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demonlike father other standout parts this time are søren pilmark´s doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marplestyle ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how they´re ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the down´s syndrome dishwasher 2 died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo
