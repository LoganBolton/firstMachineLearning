this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesnt try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in naturebr br i wont talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatchedbr br earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we dont appreciate it one bitbr br this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like thisbr br 1010 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible
