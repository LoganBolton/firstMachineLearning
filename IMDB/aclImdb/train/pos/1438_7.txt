full marks for pacinos rendering of the speech over the dead kids coffin shakespeares mark antony would be put to shamebr br was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voiceover postscriptbr br there is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male orientedthe women are mere appendages
