city hall is a somewhat mixed bag part vignettes of nyc political life and part moralizing tale al pacino a dukakisesque boss with presidential dreams gives an oft times sullen or subdued performance theres a couple times when he chews the scenery and in the case of city hall this is where he shines john cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance without going into caricature of a new orleans dialect or sliding into melodrama during the films climax danny aiello as a burrough political chief is also very good i love showtunes toobr br the major problem with city hall and it is a good movie in many ways is the general feeling of a lack of momentum it comes off more like a documentary than a motion picture we see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective and naturally the viewer doesnt become involved when the viewer doesnt get involved to a certain degree they become apathetic towards the characters and eventually the plotbr br this tends to alienate and what should have been a riveting detail divulging finale came off as a hmmmuhokay they say you cant fight city hall as the tread worn cliche goes yet it still cant stop you from thinking what might have been if they had just tightened up the screenplay and pacing of this movie
