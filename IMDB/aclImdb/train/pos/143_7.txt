riget ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one this series dont seem to be quite as serious as the first one there are much more comedy in this good one thoughbr br were back at the danish rigshospitalet the danish national hospital mrs drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done but fate wants it otherwise she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and its soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdombr br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones its well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy good story but not as good original and thrilling as the first seriesbr br the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast they are all very good its an odd story and setting some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job yet these actors handle this whole situation perfectlybr br much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact the cinematography is one of those qualities the handheld camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watchbr br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first also be prepared to see some more i didnt think that green thing looked all too good thought it was unoriginal and didnt fit never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good the nondigital effects looks good too little brother looks just really odd but you accept it all over id say effects are from ok to goodbr br the music is also quite good moody and nice some of it are really touching it fits really nice as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very wellbr br all together this makes a good sequel if youd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed it has many of the same qualities as the first series however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this these two makes up a series you dont wanna miss
