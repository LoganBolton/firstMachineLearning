this is one of the best crimedrama movies during the late 1990s it was filled with a great cast a powerful storyline and many of the players involved gave great performances pacino was great he should have been nominated for something john cusack was good too as long as the viewer doesnt mind his louuusiana accent he may come off as annoying if you cant stand this dialect the way that pacinos character interacted with cusacks character was believable dramatic and slightly comical at times danny aiello was superb as always david paymer was great in a supporting role bridget fonda was good but not memorable there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters probably too many it may take a second viewing to remember which zapatti was which after so many crossreferences one has to stop and think just to recap the ending didnt have a lot of sting it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown this was one of the few problems with the film since the movie wasnt billed as a huge blockbuster big screen hit it made some forget that this movie even existed pacino and aiello were great but the films lack of splash in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations it was semisuccessful in the home market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there made in 1996 it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to comebr br so make yourself some lemon pudding youll see and see this movie
