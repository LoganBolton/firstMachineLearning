the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker  generally female  garnering footage from the chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint his american counterpart also as unashamed and delusional the oppressed workers who are given a voice and of course the drunken americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in new orleans br br the glimmer of hope comes when some americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like 010 per hour to do so you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner andor they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard laborbr br i have wondered where those necklaces came from not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world honorable mention goes to walmart it is simply amazing and clearly just the tip of the iceberg
