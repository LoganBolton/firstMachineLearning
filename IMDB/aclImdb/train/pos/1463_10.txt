mardi gras made in china provides a wonderful intricate connection between popular culture nudity and globalization through the making and tossing of beads i saw this film at the international film festival of boston and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states the eyeopening film is humorous indepth serious nonpatronizing and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role it is worth comparing to murderball  its simply that well done the young women workers in china have various points of view and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline the revelers during carnival are the highlight but only because this excellent film provides indepth context inside the factory in china without narration bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film i would have never thought about the connection between beads china and new orleans now i think about the human connection between almost every object but also the role of globalization inequality and fun more importantly i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film unlike other films on globalization that ive seen
