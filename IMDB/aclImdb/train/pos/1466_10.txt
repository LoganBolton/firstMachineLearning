the perverts guide to cinema 2007  br br if loving cinema makes me a pervert so be itbr br if you are a true moviefreak like me then im sure you cant get enough of films about filmmaking and i dont mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience well if thats the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for youbr br in sophie fiennes sister of ralph  joseph if you were wondering has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive and often outrageous takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing probing and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings socioeconomic political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging determined and nearfrenetic dissertations to go from explaining how the bates house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego superego  id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic laymanbr br although i had no idea who zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion the host comes across as a mad prophet br br fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick lynch hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz the red shoes and fight club br br theres something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a films themes  even if they are freudianjungian to a fault  then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video its the only way to appreciate it
