i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it and they are not pervs as a must see and it is a must see just dont expect to see something outbreakingbr br the freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film but theres just too much perversion and it doesnt stick in the endbr br some of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowskis blue most of david lynchs some of hitchcocks and perhaps a couple more i missed i just remembereddogville and i usually dont miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the airbr br other than being repetitive which makes it too long the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theorybr br i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr zizek to revive freuds theory which has been numb for too long specially in north america again its way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood
