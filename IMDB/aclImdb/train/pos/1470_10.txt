theres the danger with the criticphilosopher slavoj zizek with his film directed by sophie fiennes which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent horror scifi surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload but in the perverts guide to cinema he also makes even the more farreaching points a point of departure from any other analysis ive seen on a collective section of films while it doesnt cover the expansive territory scorseses movie documentaries cover the same attachments are there and zizek has a definite love for all of these perverse examples and films primarily the work of hitchcock lynch chaplin and tarkovsky yet one shouldnt go into seeing this if you can find it that is i got to see it almost by luck thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psychosexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse deranged manner if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id superego and ego harpos example is most deadon for mebr br hes not just one to take on the classics though he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former and in the attachment of violence in dealing with ones own self as well as ones double in the latter he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his childrens births happens elsewhere the ideals of fatherhood male sexuality the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmares creation and female subjectivity are explored perhaps most deadon with vertigo this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if its the zapruder film where he dissects the three colliding points of psychosexual stance in the dont you look at me scene in blue velvetbr br now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere excited and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voiceover as scorsese does but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality and how they overlap intersect become one and the same or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters ie lost highway by putting himself in the locations the films take place in funniest is first seeing him in the boat heading towards the same dock tippi hedrens boat heads to at the beginning of the birds equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multifaceted points of frank booth only one when hes in solarislike territory does it seem a little cheesy but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this setup and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizeks words come throughbr br there were some films i of course wouldve expected chiefly from hitchcock and lynch but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the perverts guide of cinema top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplins films albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of voice and the ones that one hasnt seen yet ie the ventriloquist horror film dr mabuse stalker among a few others that inspire immediate feelings of wow i have to see that immediately no questions asked zizek is a powerful writer with his work and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place to be entertained sure but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there as he put it looking into a toilet its probably one of the greatest films about cinema and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire the idsuperegoego and of the supernatural in fantasy that you may never seeunless distribution finally kicks in if only on the smallest levels
