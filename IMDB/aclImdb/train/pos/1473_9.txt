bear in mind any film let alone documentary which asserts any kind of truth will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless those of you who are already masters of psychology film and captains of the soul will no doubt find this movie redundant after all you already know everything there is to know congratsbr br for those of us in the minority like myself i found the perverts guide to cinmeamostly brilliant and worth watching for those interested in movies psychology and modern philosophybr br a little like scott mclouds understanding comics director sophie fiennes intergrates slovene philosopher psychologist and social critic slavoj zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses the cover is an image from the birdszizek takes a boat out to recreate the shotbr br lacanian psychoanalysis does not necessarily scream an evening of great funbut it is if you like movies that is having some knowledge of lacanian psychoanalysis helps symbolic real and imaginary are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first but the scenes which zizek selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me a very abstract subject in fact its probably better to have a familiarity with the films hes discussing than with the terminology he uses which becomes clearer as the film goes onbr br why i love this film isnt because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about lacan but shows in a very practical and clever manner where film and psychology and by default philosophy meetbr br why is the sound of music kinda fascistic why is short cuts about more than just class and alienation why do the birds attack in the birds what is there to learn about the mind from alien resurrection what does the planet of solaris want what does psycho and the marx brothers have to do with each other and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after moviewell zizek has some ideasbr br the role of the voice in both the excorcist and star wars revenge of the sith is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity i begin to wonderat one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children jokingly it seems butbr br anyway its a fascinating documentary which anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant something more than was literally stated should make an attempt to seebr br and anyone interested in slavoj zizek this is a must as well much less dry than reality of the virtual and more direct than zizek two other pseudodocs about the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism as he is being dubbed in the english speaking worldbr br the perverts guide to cinema is not about the role of sex in cinema zizek claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art because it teaches how to desire and not what to desire and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema its about finding the cinema in reality and how important and exciting that can be hard to find and a bit long but well worth the trouble one of the most stimulating movie watching experiences ive ever had
