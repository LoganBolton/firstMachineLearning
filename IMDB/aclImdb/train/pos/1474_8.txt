i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as salacious as it sounds this is a threepart documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring slovenian superstar philosopherpsychoanalyst slavoj zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality it was directed by sophie fiennes of the multitalented fiennes clan shes sister to actors ralph and josephbr br i enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours it didnt help that an illadvised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or sobr br my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although thats really just me saying id like to see part four and five and sixbr br zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films hes discussing so for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay from hitchcocks the birds or sitting in the basement of the bates motel from psycho which is not to say that his theories are not provocative even when i found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films which is exactly what hes trying to accomplish
