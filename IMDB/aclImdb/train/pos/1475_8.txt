hes stocky sweaty slightly crosseyed and restless he stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert he claims that we  the film viewers  perceive the screen as a toilet bowl and are all secretly wishing for all the st to explode from the inside hes unpredictable and scary well come on you could have guessed by now hes one of the leading philosophers of our agebr br slavoj iek is both a narrator and a subject of sophie fiennes extraordinary new film a perverts guide to the cinema fiennes illustrates a featurelong lecture by iek and does so in two ways by providing exemplary film clips and putting iek on real or reconstructed locations from the movies he speaks about its always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies although revenge of the sith got here as well but the main attraction of a perverts guide is iek himself what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again what is more outrageous ieks views or ieks screen presence in a documentary by astra taylor iek 05 slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent because he claimed he feels like he doesnt exist in the first place the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly and talk he did and how also a perverts guide is dominated by his voice  delivering perfect english in most crazy way and making some astonishing points about the cinemabr br what are those well for example he sees chaplins reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself kind of alien force taking over the human being  think the ventriloquist segment of dead of night 45 he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects not to provide us with them he identifies groucho marx as super ego chico as ego and harpo as id he says a million other interesting things and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him so persuasive and captivating are his looks at some point i couldnt help but stare at his thick scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath craving of course for more insightsbr br most notable are ieks readings of lynch and hitchcock which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them the cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of ieks lecture memorable and  unlike others  difficult to argue with since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors this doesnt go for his reading of tarkovsky for example upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality dismissing precisely whats so remarkable in all tarkovsky namely strong religious intuitions and imagesbr br the question isnt whether iek is inspiring and brilliant because he is or whether fiennes film is worth watching because it is likewise the real question is rather are iek views coherent one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride but after the whole thing is over some doubts remain for example while considering vertigo 58 iek states that whats hidden behind human face is a perfect void which makes face itself only a facade something of a deception in its own means however when in the final sequence we hear about the evershattering finale of city lights 31 as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another its hard not to ask what happened to the whole facadething why should we grant chaplins face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive kim novaks of this same privilege in two bold strokes or maybe that incoherence might also be read in lacans terms the name of the notoriously unreadable french psychoanalyst is fundamental to ieks thought the film has all the virtues of a splendid twoandahalf hours lecture lots of ground are covered many perspectives employed even some firstrate wisecracks made when iek travels on a melanie daniels boat from the birds 63 and tries to think as she did he comes up with i want to fk mitch but it has also one shortcoming that isnt inherent to twoandahalf hours lecture as such its almost obsessively digressive ieks yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of ieks perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on changing subjects constantly overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant cool fizzing wave youre simultaneously taken by surprise refreshed in mortal danger and confused no end as you finish watching your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and youre already planning on rewatching some films  but you also share a sense of having survived a calamitybr br the ultimate question is did iek lost it or havent we even came close to the real thing once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other not having any movies around to turn our faces to i dare you all who will have enough guts to approach iek and defy him my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life you become a believer
