casomai is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage the story is very believable in telling the strange seesaw between oblivion and continuous interference by others which is fairly typical in italy one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere though pavignano and dalatri were very good at writing and that is one of the strong points of the movie acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and wellrounded all in all a truly deserving movie probably one of the best italian movies of the year
