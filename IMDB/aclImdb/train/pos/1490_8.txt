everyone has a first love and though it is hard to define that feeling when youre younger it is there aching inside you that is what malaysian filmmaker yasmin ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple straightforward fashionbr br such an approach is especially convenient in this case as the love story at the films core involves two twelveyear olds and would therefore make any attempts at deeper analysis seem contrived and pretentious that they dont is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading nonactors sharifah aryana and mohd syafie naswip the former plays orked already seen as an adult character in ahmads previous picture gubra a lively almost rebellious girl who perhaps influenced by her british upbringing her mother studied in england despises playing with dolls preferring to play violent sports with the boys then one day she meets mukhsin naswip who has come to spend the holidays at his aunts house and all of a sudden she changes her habits goodbye fistfights hello bikeriding and treeclimbing but what does this mean are they just friends or is something more implied something neither of them is yet ready to understand let alone acceptbr br given the young age of the protagonists answering those questions borders on impossible and so like in several smaller films lost in translation comes to mind there is no real closure a choice that leaves a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying aftertaste the naturalistic unfiltered acting especially aryanas gets to the heart almost immediately and a strong supporting cast orkeds family most of all helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing the downtoearth approach isnt always that effective the hilarious subplot regarding an adulterous neighbor is dropped way too early and it is hard to justify the bizarre pulp fiction reference at the start of the feature but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of independent asian cinema
