i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment theres tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of youespecially if you didnt watch sepet andor gubra for 76 timesbr br i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future br br and i absolutely love the voiceovers its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsins voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the treebr br it captured malaysians attitudeand in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tonguedcomplete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isnt sorted out br br all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it br br it kept me glued to the screen i couldnt even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha
