an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything its a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly oldfashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates all tied together by a wraparound story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starand what he does to the inspector its a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget add to that the acting talents of peter cushing christopher lee denholm elliott joss ackland ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and youve got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again just dont answer the phone if anyone from stoker real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english countryside
