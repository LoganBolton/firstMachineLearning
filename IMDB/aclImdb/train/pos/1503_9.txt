spoilers included this film surely is the best amicus production ive seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that dripped blood is a horroromnibusan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talespeter duffels film wisely doesnt pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high qualitylevel and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert bloch yes the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone psycho were also marking peter duffels solid and very professional debut as a director br br the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics but theyre almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horrorauthor who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isnt exactly originalbut its very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horrorlegend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker still haunted by the image of an unreachable and longlost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums isnt new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shockmoments and theres a constant tense atmosphere its a terrific warmup for what is arguably the best story number 3 another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father hes very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere the devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampirecloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that theres even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to costar christopher lee in the dracula series most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt the cultqueen from the vampire lovers certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmher cleavage in particular br br no doubt about itthe house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of moodsettling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies thatll terrify you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be highly recommended one extra little remark though this film may notrepeat may not under any circumstances be confused with the dorm that dripped blood this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80s slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole
