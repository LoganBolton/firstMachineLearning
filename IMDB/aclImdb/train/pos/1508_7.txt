this movie is good for what it is and unpretentious i wouldnt watch it twice however i am a peter cushing completist and thats why i watched it the best asset of this movie is brevity and effectiveness compared to other similar movies it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four plus one segments lasts under 30 minutes with the last under 10 good uncanny vibes in the first segment horror writer suffering from writers block relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen plot contrivance similar to premature burial good use of the pointofview twist is the writer getting mentally illor as the ending shows his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husbands phobias to drive him mad  secure his estatesyet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious planbr br in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murdereror was shebr br the third segment was the less interesting to mebr br the fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks hes the best of all sunken to the depths of low budget c movies seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal this segment also lacks the solidity of the first twobr br acting is fair with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it good movie taken with a grain of salt not the best cushing nor leebut worth watching
