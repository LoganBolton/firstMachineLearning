yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun thats because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spiritand there were even occasionally a few laughs this isnt at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good its one of the better movies of this style i have seenbr br the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenantsbr br the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writers block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliotts block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappearsmaking it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alivebr br the second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdownbr br christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very wellbr br the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film its actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwees line when he basically said that lees and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosis perhaps this is why lee didnt take this part despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and funpossibly as good or better than the first segmentbr br considering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing its hard not to like this film
