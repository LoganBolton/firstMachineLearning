featuring a few of hammers allstars this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of its previous tenants whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective in search of a missing actorbr br story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife whove just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels he creates a demented character named dominic whos a very creepy looking strangler and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help a subplot is introduced which frankly didnt really work for me i wont spoil it for youbr br the next story the best in my opinion stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson a man whos moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museumthat deals in the macabre where hes very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past soon thereafter an old friendwho also has a history with this woman is in town for business and drops by to see him the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eyebr br story three stars one of my very favoriteschristopher lee who plays john reid after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter well come to find outif she knew what lee did she would have certainly understoodbr br the final story is a rather lighthearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that hes portrayed several times in his careerbr br overall the pacing and direction were very good as was the most of the performances there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance this ones a keeper and comes highly recommended
