the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies if the monster club is included as part of the series this would make eight movies although that movie is very different from the othersbr br i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens my feelings for them today are just as strongbr br i spent many years trying to track down this movie the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy as great as though the movie is i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it it wasnt quite as good as i was led to believe whilst better than its two predecessors its nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstratebr br the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology i couldnt help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor mans version of donald pleasance or ian hendry i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role we could have even had both here  one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent they could and i believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much betterbr br the movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the housebr br the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation some excellent direction by peter duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script elliotts performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story the story ends with a semitwist but i couldnt help get the sense of a script which didnt allow it to live up to its potentialbr br the second story sees peter cushing move into the house he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of cushings performance really brings this emotionallymoving story to life he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushings loneliness this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushings mind anyway cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end joss ackland plays cushings rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushingbr br the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee  my favourite horror actor of all time  move into the house with his daughter mr lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all he even brings in a school governess to educate her the governess played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong without giving too much away i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role christopher lees presence is truly electrifying in every scene hes in chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one storybr br the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and thats what matters jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak when pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire pertwees performance has to be seen to be believed it truly is hilarious ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much largerbr br the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house the rest youll be able to work out for yourself as weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical endingbr br im convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesnt lie with peter duffell the director who really does his best with what hes got i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later moviesbr br overall the house that dripped blood despite its flaws is a mustsee for fans of the amicus anthologies fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out youll enjoy it
