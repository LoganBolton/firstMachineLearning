gbs wrote his own screen adaptation of this nobel prize winning play but didnt live to see it produced he had won an oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play pygmalion when otto preminger mounted produced and directed this production in 1957 seven years after shaws death he had noted british author graham greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choicebr br taking a cue from shaws own screenplay greene uses material from the stage epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play one early and one late in joans story into a unified and most satisfying whole where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission here it works just as well with a return to king charles baloiss bedchamber where the man joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation and more material from shaws epilogue  the introduction of the shade of john gielguds warwick the english king makerbr br the majority of the language is solid gbs and the performances from stalwart shauvians like felix aymlers inquisitor or harry andrews de stogumber to relative newcomers the film established jean sebergs career are first rate it may jar some only familiar with richard widmarks many movie villains to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly dauphin but the performance  oddly top billed  is professional even if arguably miscastbr br the symbolism of the opening credits and the directors choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve shaw and the story well go in expecting quality entertainment and you wont be disappointed
