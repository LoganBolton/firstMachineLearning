having seen the peter otoole version recently i was ready to be awed by the smart writing in this version little time is spent on the fighting which i prefer instead we are shown all the many motives underlying both the french and english who held normandy politicos and priests who put her to death even the worst hypocrite of them all the archbishop leaves us with the thought that of course she was innocent the innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty she had no idea what she was saying no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church unschooled she had no idea of what the churchs stand on such matters even wasbr br preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death and i appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her why they used gas jets in the movie and 2 of them were stopped up suddenly the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her thankfully for her they didnt have to repeat the shot as it was so realistic she was being burned pretty traumatic introduction for an iowa girl to her new career of actingbr br john gielgud performed outstandingly he is the english politico who is orchestrating the show he also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death you dont want to be around to watch them die you might shrink from your duty the next timenot that such delicacies bother the soul of our wouldbe president we christians even the most antisemitic have no problem with falling back on the old testament when it comes to capital punishment even though it was overridden by jesus words bring on public executions like this little girls smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls sensesbr br the only little pick i have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite even to the point of madness there should have been more expansion of his character more dialogueas the sudden coming to his senses doesnt make sensebr br and whether graham greene does this deliberately or not st joan is such a selfassured little upstart you almost but not quite are glad she meets her comeuppance and when she turned down life in prison for some reason i thought of anne sexton the poet who accused sylvia plath of stealing her death when she committed suicide knowing such an action guarantees immortality you gotta wonderbr br if ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logictight compartments this is one st joan should have turned buddhist and quieted the voices in her mind
