old people show im 15 and have been watching the show since i was 12 recoding it onto my sky box everyday from hallmark and bbc 1 i really wish they hadnt cancelled it they didnt even get a proper farewell but what an adventure all those episodes i think ive seen them all and not one comes to mind that i didnt like and enjoybr br its a shame the bbc keep swapping between diagnoses murder and murder she wrote never watched it and dont intend to anyways he characters in diagnoses murder are so indepth and the chemistry between the actors is amazing it really was a sad day when they cancelled this show
