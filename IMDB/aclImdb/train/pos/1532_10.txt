this like murder she wrote is one of those shows that after a stressful day at school i sit down in front of the tv and watch why because i genuinely enjoy it and its a shame its not on the air anymore dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan a doctorturneddetective who with his son solves murders he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast namely his reallife son barry van dyke victoria rowell is also good but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared this show is so entertainingwith great guest stars its a bit obvious at times like colombo but in every episode there is always something to chuckle about in conclusion a great series with two thumbs up and a 1010 bethany cox
