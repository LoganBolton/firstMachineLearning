the tighter the drama the better the film of sister rivalry this little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in sweden so im glad to find that wasnt the whole case funny bits on smalltown bickering are there to enjoy surely but the drama takes center stage as the story progresses and not just family drama it also raises poignant questions on respecting differences of peoples lifestyle choicesbr br great character ensemble with many superb and moving dramatic scenes that score credibility points and theyre not just scattershot but hold everything in place it just makes me assume that if ingmar bergman had made this the drama would suit him the international attention probably would have been immediatebr br 7 out of 10 from ozjeppe
