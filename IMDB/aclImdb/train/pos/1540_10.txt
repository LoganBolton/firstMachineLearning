this is an incredible film i cant remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered its funny its tragic its compelling and most of all its a slice of swedish small town life it crushes the clichés and dwells deeper it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the charactersbr br big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday crossing paths with people she hasnt met in several years although the story itself isnt unique it offers a fresh approach the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who arent very close or at least dont realize how close they arebr br one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast first im more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no socalled alist swedish actors in this film usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva röse to prove that you dont need words to convey an emotionbr br the writing is also very appealing the dialogue is more than believable and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two its ahead by miles maria blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didnt know you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film i cant wait for her next onebr br once you start watching this you really want to see it through
