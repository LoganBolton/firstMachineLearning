this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of its roots it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis this room hasnt been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallvilles past not to mention lionels conversations with lex are always admirablebr br another pleasant return is well uv guessed it is bart allenaka impulse acaka aquaman and victor stoneaka cyborg not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length moviebr br from there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up 331 bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and graceful with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character br br the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season 4 this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark sais at the end we didnt find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episodebr br i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10 first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on olivers bike rememeber from the arrow episode clark and impulse should have obviously ran and aquaman should have swam via another route but that was soo incredibly cheesy it nocked off 2 points from the full 10br br secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow sais lets go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do outweigh the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6br br 7 out of 10
