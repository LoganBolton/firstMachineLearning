i love this show mr blick gordon and waffle are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves collectively as brothers i often find myself trying to imitate the tired sighing accent of their butler hovis or even the scottish borough of gordon there should be more episodes made about human kimberly the episode about the cats disguising themselves as preteen girls to gain admittance to human kimberlys slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink rootbeer is a hilarious classic we cant drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie slap shot future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd
