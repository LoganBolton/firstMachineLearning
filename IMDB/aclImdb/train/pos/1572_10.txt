when reading a review from another user saying that its a terrible game i could not stand idle and do nothingbr br well this game is great from the news clips with two real persons full of humour sense and credibility to the story i find it very good i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions when riding the bike here and therebr br except that its a great game with a great story good graphics excellent characters great soundtrack i recommend it surely it can be a bit old but still enjoyable at least on the dreamcast but the ps2 version shall be the same
