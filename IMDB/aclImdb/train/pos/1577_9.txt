spoilers withinbr br it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen das 1995br br the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually i felt it was highly appealing  especially where the visual narrative was concerned the titlesequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the pastbr br to clarify two points that many people have been confused bybr br firstly lena did not sleep with goebbels although this may have seemed implied it was not the intent von trotta told me so herself and she is a very nice lady by the waybr br secondly the timeframe of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the closeup of the memorial and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set freebr br overall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much overmovied era it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screensbr br more of the same please margarethe
