berlinborn in 1942 margarethe von trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer she has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a womans sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the new york times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews ive ever read in that paper is not a perfect film it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless germans demonstrating in a berlin streetbr br cowriter von trotta uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young womans search for information about her mothers never disclosed life as a child in the german capital during world war iibr br the husband of ruth weinstein jutta lampe has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance ruth not only sits shivah the jews weeklong mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith her apartment in new york city reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouses labors her americanborn daughter hannah maria schrader and her brother are a bit putoff by moms assumption of restrictive orthodox jewish practices but they pitch in the mother coldly rejects the presence of hannahs fiance a nonjew named luis fedja van huet a domestic crisis might well erupt as ruth warns that shell disown hannah if she doesnt give up doting handsome luis stay tunedbr br a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about moms childhood in berlin hannah is intrigued  she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life this is very very realistic i grew up with parents who fled nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the holocaust those days were simply not discussedbr br so hannah having learned that a german gentile woman saved ruths life traipses off to berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing were she not this would have been a very short film but ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 yearold lena fischer doris schade now a widow as the happytobeinterviewed but shaken up by repressed memories lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day berlin and the wartime capitalbr br the young lena of 1943 katja riemann was a fine pianist married to a jewish violinist fabian fischer martin feifel with the advent of the nazi regime he was required to use israel as a middle name just as jewish women had to add sarah to their namesincidentally i wish imdb had not given fabians name on its characters list with the false israel includedit simply perpetuates a name applied by nazis as a mark of classification and degradationbr br while germany deported most of its jewish population to concentration camps those married to aryans were exempted for a time until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were jewish women married to nonjews the roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensitybr br the young lena tries to locate her husband all she and many other women know is that theyre confined in a building on rosenstrasse the crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them jewloving whore being one appellation as a subplot lena more or less adopts eightyearold ruth who hid when her mother was seized remember ruth is now sitting shiva in manhattan the child ruth is fetchingly portrayed by svea lohde br br through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail the men and a handful of women are released as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but thats another storybr br von trotta builds up the tension and each womans story is both personal and universal hannah continues to prod the aging lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect shes not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murderedbr br the contrasts between rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified berlin provide a recurring thematic element todays berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past von trotta makes that point very wellbr br the main actors are uniformly impressive lenas husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters  including the local police and military  as a oneway trip to oblivion the older ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy new york life hannah is very believable as a young woman whose fathers death triggers a need to discover her familys past these things happen although the timess critic appears not to know thatbr br von trottas hand is sure but not perfect a scene with goebbels at a soiree enjoying lenas violin playing is unnecessary and distractive the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical toplevel hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives most of the german officers come from central casting and are molded by the erich von stroheim copy and paste school of teutonic nastiness but thats understandablebr br the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim its a paradigm case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans protested unfortunately that argument is nonsense the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably selfinterested most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent antisemitism thats why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that prenazi endemic antisemitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 onbr br the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war so a ray of light it was and von trottas movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists and always willbr br 910
