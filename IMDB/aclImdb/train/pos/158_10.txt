ive seen this film more than once now and theres always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then  this is part of petzolds game he plays along with the rules of genrebr br its very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteohummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction its more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings its a reverie sorts of  so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelgangerconstellations br br also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzolds everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesnt say much about the nature of gespenster at all
