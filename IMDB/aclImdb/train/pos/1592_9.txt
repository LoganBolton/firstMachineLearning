what i like about you is definitely a show that i couldnt wait to see each day amanda bynes is such an excellent actress and i grew up watching her show the amanda show shes a very funny person and seems to be down to earth holly is such a likeable person and has an outthere personality i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down so she messed herself up at times but thats what made the show so greatbr br i especially loved the show when the character vince came along nick zano is very hot and funny as well as gary wesley jonathan the whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm jennie garth allison munn and leslie grossman were all very interesting i especially loved lauren shes the best she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what shes gonna do or say next overall the show is really nice but the reason i didnt give it a 10 was because theres no more new episodes and because the episodes couldve been longer and more deep
