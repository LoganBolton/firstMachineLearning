what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but arent sure you would see the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun the second part i season 23 which are more stale they come and go in what you want what happens with many series is that they dont end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain this one also somewhat did the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series usually but it doesnt this ending is perfect for the series it fits perfect actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in vals life actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end but later on it changed they chose to take vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on topbr br see it many times the series is actually very cool just dont expect the second part to be that good it isnt but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when i have seen the whole series i will be back
