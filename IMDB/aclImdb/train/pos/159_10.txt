this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead placebr br ninas life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herselfbr br but the films title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people françoise a french woman is a victim of such ghosts she once lost her child daughter in berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattentiveness now time has passed and françoise is back in berlin still looking for the missing childbr br nina could be that child after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heartshaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identitybr br and nina adopts that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also longs for a mother but in the end she is emptyhanded toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman marie is dead concludes françoises husband and the statement could not be more disillusioning nina is just a niña a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives therefore in the end we see nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems joyless and uncertain
