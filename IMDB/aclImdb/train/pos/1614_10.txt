there is nothing not to like about moonstruck im from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors  actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number 3 its a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming thats amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food ill kick you till youre dead chrissy bring me the big knife whos dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when theres nothing good to watch because it makes me happy
