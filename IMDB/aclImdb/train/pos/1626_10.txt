this movie is actually funny if youd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it its called blonde and blonder so dont expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes its just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends especially if youre not too sober lol  pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks its a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art cmon this movie is about blondes its supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will
