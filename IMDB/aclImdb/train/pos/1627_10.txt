blonde and blonder has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie youre being utterly unreasonable it feels like a late era carry on when the series was no longer blazing trails but was still more funny than not think behind or england and you wont be too far off the mark pamela and denise are bubbly charming and clearly aware this isnt a masterpiece theyre making although you can give me it over lots of things im told to like the supporting cast are energetic even if some of them arent particularly good i cant see a couple of duff turns in a movie thats already practically forgotten making much difference to anything so just smile i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it
