this movie is so cheap its endearing with ron liebmann major vaughn providing the most entertaining onscreen diatribes in film history i own 2 copies of this movie on videoon one ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at hash obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves cant keep a straight face
