this is one of the greatest 80s movies it sticks out like a turd in a punchbowl i cant believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart ispeakanoenlish chinese lady and ups guy on speed whats up with that and i love ron leibmanhes foxy wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course hes not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national lampoons vacation if you liked movies such as porkys fast times last american virgin or any of the other 80s teenfocused movies youll love this one rent it and youll see what i mean
