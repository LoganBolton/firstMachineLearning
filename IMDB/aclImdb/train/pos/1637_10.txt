i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years it does get better with every viewing i agree with all of the positive reviews here yes its gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days i found myself doing commentary as i watched it someone on here said rip torn was miscast i couldnt disagree more he is brilliant as the dour miserly clyde stewart who says little and works like a slaveworkhorse conchatta farrell is fantastic as the widowed elinor whom clyde hires as a housekeepercook along with her 7 old daughter lilia skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma also a star is the stark montana prairie it is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle there are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary no special effects here what you see is real it even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script once you see heartland youll never forget it it deserves all the 10s it gets here
