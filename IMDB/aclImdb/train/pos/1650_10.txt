an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but unloved i am told by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation it is now only viewable in private collections and via the british film institute at special request very unfortunate as ian holms nuanced portrayal of the wearybutdetermined bernard samson is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife and michael degen as the mercurial werner the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game
