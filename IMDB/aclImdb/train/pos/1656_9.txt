thieves and liars presents us with a very naturalistic depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many puerto ricans and force them to make difficult if not impossible choices about their and their loved ones lives the cast is excellent considering that some are nonprofessional actors an excellent choice that augments the level of reality in the film the photography propels the story without intrusion as it should be in this type of film the script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the boricuas in a very deep way sometimes it feels like youre watching a documentary watching this film you feel as if youve secretly entered the real puerto rican society and stand invisibly watching it implode i loved it
