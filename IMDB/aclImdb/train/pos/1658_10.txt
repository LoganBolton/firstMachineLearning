if youve seen this movie youve been to puerto rico ive lived in puerto rico all my life and have to shamefully admit that we pr are living a real chaos right now drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day these people will shoot anyone anytime and anywhere and many innocent lives have been lost because of this we dont feel safe anymore and in addition to this our socalled justice is no longer moved by truth and rightness but by money influence and power ladrones y mentirosos is based on real deplorable facts and truly portrays puerto ricos three main problems the drugrelated killings money and power manipulating our courtrooms and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of this ricardo and his wife poli with their truetolife plot and their award winning direction were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is puerto rico is a beautiful and friendly country living a nightmare that doesnt seem to end   they recently won the copper wing award for best director in the world cinema competition at the 2006 phoenix film festival
