sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics the strange vice of mrs wardh and the unforgettably titled your vice is a locked room and only i have the key  but even so i wasnt expecting too much from this film the case of the scorpions tail doesnt get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion  but i dont know why because this is at least as good as those two dario argento may be the king of giallo but with the five films that he made  sergio martino surely isnt too far behind in some ways he even surpasses the master all of martinos films were released prior to the jewel in argentos crown the magnificent profondo rosso so back in the early seventies  martino was the king the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man his wife inherits 1 million and it isnt long before theres people out for her blood when she turns up dead shortly thereafter an insurance investigator and a plucky attractive young journalist follow up the casebr br the case of the scorpions tail may not benefit from the beautiful edwige fenech but it does have two of martinos collaborators on board most famous is george hilton who worked with marino on the strange vice of mrs wardh and all the colors of the dark along with a number of other giallos hilton has a great screen presence and every time i see him in an italian thriller it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast the beautiful anita strindberg who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead sergio martino does a good job in the directors chair once again with several beautiful scenes  the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting the score by bruno nicolai wardh excellently sets the mood but it is the script that once again is the driving force behind martinos success ernesto gastaldi the writer for martinos other four giallo has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo pitfall of not making sense thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre the case of the scorpions tail is a quality giallo film and yet another success for the great sergio martino if you like giallo youll love this
