im really tempted to reward the case of the scorpions tail with a solid 10 out of 10 rating but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970s is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch but even without an extra point for nostalgia this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story uncanny atmosphere bloodsoaked killing sequences and superb casting choices in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martinos finest giallo and that has got to mean something as the strange vice of mrs wardh all the colors of the dark torso and your vice is a locked room and only i have the key are all topnotch genre achievements as well but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultracompelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control following her husbands peculiar death in a plane explosion  lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and shes eager to leave the country as soon as possible due to the bizarre circumstances the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece there lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the cases mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money im always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i dont want to risk giving away essential plot elements in the case of the scorpions tail the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway and i certainly dont want to ruin this for you many red herrings follow after that but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a 100 satisfying the denouement is at least surprising its also a very stylish film with imaginative camerawork and excellent music by bruno nicolai everyone s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didnt make it to this cast she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino gialli but anita strindberg lizard in a womans skin who saw her die is a more than worthy replacement for her the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies man deluxe if youre a fan of giallo dont wait as long as i did to watch this film
