say what you want about andy milligan  but if his family was even 10 as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the pictures box office appeal several times during the film milligans ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly goodlooking standins for milligans homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60s guitar rock its pretty easy to fastforward through if youre trying to pay attention to milligans original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i dont think ive ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before
