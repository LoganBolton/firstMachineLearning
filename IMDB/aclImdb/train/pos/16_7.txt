i found this to be a soso romancedrama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it its not a hallmark hall of fametype family film with sleepingbeforemarriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least languagewise br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult thats the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isnt that memorablebr br its still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
