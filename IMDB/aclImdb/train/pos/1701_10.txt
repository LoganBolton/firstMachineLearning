this is a thinking mans silly movie if you dont expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i  from casting the voice of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either waybr br its not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie
