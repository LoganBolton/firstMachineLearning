i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff lamentsbr br this happens a lot in chicago his deputy asksbr br well no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martians haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the sheriffs daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suitbr br the martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on its a fun family movie
