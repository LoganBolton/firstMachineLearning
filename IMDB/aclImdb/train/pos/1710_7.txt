this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons each episode was a new short story the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesnt fit the role of a normal and third class guysas he calls himself in the movie in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesnt have the talent to pull it offbr br i would suggest watching the series if it is available it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction the acting of the tv actors was much better than these starsbr br the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an houror 45 minutes story to 2 hours so it has to get draggy even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make upbr br this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you havent watched the original tv serial the script and the ending of the serial was much betterbr br spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him he is aware and tell her that he doesnt want to be repayed and never helped with that intention the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement the deliver just wasnt rightbr br but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy no credit should be given to the directorscriptwriter the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi i am not sure if this is premchand munshis story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshis and other great hindi writers stories
