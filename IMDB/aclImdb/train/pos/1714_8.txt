watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in ones mindbr br movie starts with abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesnt leaving soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she dont have any thing to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of storybr br the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seatbr br dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all rightbr br a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts my rating for this is 810
