ahista ahista is one little small brilliant i started watching it and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new but as the film went on i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film the fantastic writing and the charming romance the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guys life theres one very good reason the film got this feel and its the fresh talent called abhay deol he is extremely convincing as the simple kindhearted and struggling ankush whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life throughout the film he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster but also as a helping and loving person who like anyone else will do anything to protect his love deol portrays all the different shades of his character whether positive or negative naturally and with complete easebr br shivam nairs direction is very good his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankushs relationships with the different people who surround him including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friends loud and plump mother whom he calls khala aunty he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a motherfigure to him as evidenced in several scenes except for abhay the rest of the cast performed well though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me she was good and had some of her mothers charm the actors who played ankushs friends were very good as was the actress who played ankushs khalabr br apart from the performances the films writing was outstanding the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant and the script was also fantastic thats mainly because despite a notsonew story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look largerthanlife the films biggest weakness was himesh reshammiyas uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film otherwise ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene the concept may not be new but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by the ending was bittersweet kind of sad yet optimistic in short this movie really grows on you slowly and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing the moving moments the charming romance the realistic proceedings and of course abhay deols memorable performance
