this period melodrama is one of griffiths earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escapebr br griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms Â– the kings court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open by contrast the dove cotes back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confinedbr br the second technique on display here is the crosscutting anyone with an interest in griffiths work will probably know about his heavy use and development of crosscutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasnt his invention however what makes griffiths crosscuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow stepbystep pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower petals onebyone as the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wallbr br at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the crosscut the dramatic ridetotherescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to griffiths pictures
