by 1909 dw griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker the sealed room is a very interesting 11 minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poes 1846 short story the cask of amontillado and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelitybr br set in medieval times the sealed room begins with the king arthur v johnson overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dovecote the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each others company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment however unbeknownst to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel henry b walthall during one romantic liaison inside the speciallybuilt room the wife and the minstrel are discovered and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple silently he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed downbr br dw griffith always had an eye for acute detail and the sealed room is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith restricts his shots to lengthy longtakes from a stationary camera as was usual at the time but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not have invented the technique griffith was crucial in popularising the use of crosscutting  that is alternating between different events occurring at the same time not only does this create a sense of continuity but it also maximises the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not only of the kings ghastly actions but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it allbr br despite these innovations the sealed room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone their panicked reactions accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia i did think however that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly
