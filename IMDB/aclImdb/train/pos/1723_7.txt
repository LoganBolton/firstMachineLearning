excellent pow adventure adapted by eric williams from his own book a paperback copy of which forms part of my fathers library that was inspired by true events it may well be the first film of its kind and therefore has a lot to answer for  not just similarly stiffupperlipped examples such as albert rn 1953 which ill be watching presently the colditz story 1955 and danger within 1959 but higherprofile releases from the other side of the atlantic namely stalag 17 1953 and the great escape 1963 this then sets the basis pretty solidly british soldiers interned in a german camp devise an ingenious plan of escape borrowing a page from greek legend  burrowing from under a vaulting horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their captors actually the film is neatly split into two halves the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel culminating in the escape itself while the latter stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral sweden typically of these british films the cast showcases several established leo genn current anthony steel and upandcoming peter finch david tomlinson and bill travers stars to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors anthony dawson bryan forbes michael goodliffe and walter gotell the three leadsescapees are genn steel and tomlinson while the first two stick together the latter goes his own way  only to run into the others on reaching safety as can be expected the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement as with most malecentered pow sagas too female interest is kept to the barest minimum director lee didnt have a lengthy career  with this and the somewhat similar albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint a town like alice 1956 his most noteworthy achievements  but he certainly milked every gripping situation in this case even if reportedly delays in filming saw lee quitting his post prematurelyleaving producer ian dalrymple with the task of tying up loose ends anyway worth special mention is the exquisite lighting particularly during nighttime sequences throughout
