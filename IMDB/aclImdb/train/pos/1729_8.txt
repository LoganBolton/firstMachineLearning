in 1943 a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in 1950 it was decided to film his account and it kickstarted a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within 1959br br the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesnt give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifullybr br leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect nonactors without exception all are constantly monotonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently exservice i suspect they recreated their war time roles as officers and gentlemenbr br this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesnt end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end
