miss decarlos starring debut has everything the writers could come up with  from the francoprussian war to the us civil war the great american west san francisco in its heyday ballet opera vaudeville stage coach bandits and a chinese junk just when you thought the plot couldnt get any screwier it does its magnificent taken tongue in cheek decarlos character here called anna marie  not salome thats the role she dances is loosely based on the career of the notorious lola montez who was the mistress of the king of prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels she did escape to the american west there is a town in arizona called salome where she danced based on the historical fact that lola montez did dance the role of salome there stagecoach cleve and the russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate nor i assume is the chinese wise man with the scottish accent  but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and decarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout
