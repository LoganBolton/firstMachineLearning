this movie was not so much promoted here in greeceeven though it got good actors  great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very powerfulits about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his homevillage after been released from a 5yo prison timedrugs the end is rather sad mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression
