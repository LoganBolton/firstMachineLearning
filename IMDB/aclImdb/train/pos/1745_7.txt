how truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi it is disarmingly friendly and lively its the document of a longlost craft the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials chandu is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic  it refreshes the mind its not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work chandu has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly funbr br without giving away too muchchandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killersbr br chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate waybr br as to the quite sexy niece nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti the sordid vindhyan the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals br br would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu doesbr br lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosiyet burtons biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor i enjoy lugosi fancy performancesbr br this serial is unjustly bashed
