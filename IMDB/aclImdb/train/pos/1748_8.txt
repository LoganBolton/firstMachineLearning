from the very beginning i was so excited to see this movie the poster is possibly the funniest ive ever seen for a movie i immediately bought one for my dorm this septemberbr br every element came together in this movie so beautifully its not often you see a movie with so many penis gay and racial jokes so praised by critics carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie youre rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid the supporting cast is brutal each of them having some problems with the ladies themselvesbr br one of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes were given this is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly this movie will often be brought up when the words chest waxing and condoms are mentioned in conversationbr br watching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it i saw a group of four mid60s women come in despite an older audience this movie still filled the entire theater with laughterbr br i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes youd see on family guy too the movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged womenbr br i dont recommend going to this movie if you arent a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended however when you are at the movie just remember this movie is all in good humor the jokes arent gay jokes theyre just jokes and theyre funny
