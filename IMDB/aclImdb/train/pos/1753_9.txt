as we all know the subgenre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being excessively raunchy isnt enough anymore ive seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these daysbr br coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you dont use it you lose it what i didnt expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development theres still the weird offthewall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and theres still enough inappropriate language to sink noahs ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a messagebr br the main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy doesnt want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he doesnt swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think hes a serial murderer its like my life storybr br the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire moviebr br i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go its quite simple it deals with andys relationship with trish for a long time and we all know whats going to happen in the end sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know whats going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small stains on the movie but theres so much good here that i can easily ignore its few faultsbr br when i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish or the scene where andy goes with his trishs daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ooh como se llama an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his partbr br actually since were talking about steve carell id like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didnt even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves thatbr br to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see im glad that i did too since its probably one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching its not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather its a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i cant believe i just wrote thatbr br my review from frider waves httpfriderwavescomindexphppagevirgin
