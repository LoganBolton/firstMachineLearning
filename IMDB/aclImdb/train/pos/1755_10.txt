this movie is a riot i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies ive seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in the movie was nonstop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that its a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all inbr br as far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great its not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed shes not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbitebr br if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre onesbr br oh and one more thing i hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list this means you ebert
