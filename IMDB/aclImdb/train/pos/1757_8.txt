the key to the 40yearold virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a 40yearold virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the 40yearold virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesnt use its protagonist as the buttend of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiositybr br carell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an exdaily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why andy is the way he is its the little things that make this film work when andys coworker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesnt just adorn his home with action figures  he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldnt even begin to focus on all of these thingsbr br the plot is fairly simplistic  andys coworker pals find out hes never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman its a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenilitybr br andys friends are a complement to his neurotic nature david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimisticbr br finally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers arent worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  trish being unaware that andy is still a virginbr br the 40yearold virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the shortlived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script  cowritten by carell  offers plentybr br however in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the 40yearold virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film its easy to understand why we like andy we care about him hes not just some cardboard cutout sexcomedy cliché  hes a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audiencebr br although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesnt offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people onscreen the best sex comedies work this way  from risky business to american pie  and that is the major difference between something like the 40yearold virgin and 40 days and 40 nights
