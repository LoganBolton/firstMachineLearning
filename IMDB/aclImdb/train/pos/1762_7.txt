all right heres the deal if youre easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one there are some painfully funny moments in the movie but i probably blushed about as much as i laughed actually i probably blushed more than i laughed and if i wasnt literally blushing on the outside then i was blushing on the inside if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame whether thats a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder i supposebr br i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter if i were to say this movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old churchgoing lady heads to the theater and has a heartattack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well thats just something i dont need on my consciencebr br so how raunchy is it hmm try about 100 times worse than the wedding crashers honestly my mom wouldve walked out during the first scene i feel its my duty to at least warn you of what to expectbr br there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but thats what i come to expect from the man judd apatow who had a hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared im all for making fun of michael mcdonald the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money paul rudd proclaiming if i hear ya mo be there one more time ill ya mo burn this place down is hilarious but its one of those things that the majority of the audience wont appreciatebr br and when we see a quick 3second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameos word up i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about itbr br strangely enough despite the raunch theres an admirable moral to the story the movie doesnt portray carrell as some freaky loser just because hes a virgin hes really portrayed as a likable admirable character sure hes a little weird after all he has a framed asia poster more videogames than an asian kid and a toy collection that features the million dollar mans boss but were never led to believe that theres actually anything wrong with the fact that hes a virgin as odd as it may seem theres a bit of an its ok to wait messagebr br but man oh man please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go that was certainly apatows intention according to him he just let some of the guys particularly rogen and malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty if you can handle that or talk that way yourself then youll love the moviebr br im not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes i find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the fword or fratboy sex discussions but thats me like i said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if theyre worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies youre likely to ever see at the theater i just dont know how interested most women will be in whats discussed by men while playing poker honestly ladies you might not want to know if youve ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good ideabr br there you go  my humble honest take on what to expect be that your guide it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion if youd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable
