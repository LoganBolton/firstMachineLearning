this is one of the funnier films ive seen it had its crude moments but they were full of charm its altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carells nipplei truly was surprisingly this is a goodnatured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve carells friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a fortyyear old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended
