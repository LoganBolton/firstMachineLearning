something about the 40 year old virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer wedding crashers is similar but they are two different films in some respects both are romantic comedies that have that kind of overthetop crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20s along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films both have some sort of formula to the stories as well but by the end of the 40 year old virgin i think i found overall it was more satisfying than crashers although one can guess where the relationship story with steve carrells character andy and catherine keeners character trish will go to it isnt too basic for one to figure out like with crashers and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic more rounded than most of the onedimensional or unexplained people in the other and perhaps it may also depend on how much you identify or just find the lunacy in bothbr br the thing is some people may go into the 40 year old virgin not knowing steve carrell as well as owen wilson or vince vaughn as carrell has built up his cult status on the daily show one of my favorite shows on now and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in anchorman and bruce almighty this is his first starring role but its not treated like some third rate vehicle he and cowriterdirector judd apatow treat the character of andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way even early on as he talks to his action figures while repainting them its also a tricky line to walk on in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the lackluster 40 days and 40 nights with josh hartnett also about sexual dysfunction as the title suggests andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little peewee herman in him the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious a good signbr br so his friends among them paul rudd romany mancoy seth rogen all very good comic foils try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over andys head to pop his cherry so to speak he almost gets with a overly drunk woman he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl and almost with his own boss jane lynch also very funny in the mockumentaries as a explitive buddy but this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with trish who works across the street from him as they build on a relationship not based at all on sex one might worry that the plot gear of how is he going to tell her such and such might get in the way of the comedy it doesnt in fact if anything carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree for practically an hour and a half of the films two hour length there was barely a moment i wasnt laughing whether big or smallbr br the big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot or one or two little stray stories the fellow coworkers have their own relationship problems as well rudds being the funniest the big laughs come through because of carrells reactions and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humorcharm or that its with some truth keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship and unlike crashers there isnt as much that doesnt make sense character wise for someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face carrell gets very high points here and like with a farrelly brothers movie the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity the waxing scene which was done for real by the way and the sort of aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film the way it comes out at first is a total uproarious surprise but if youre willing not to get offended by it theres more where that came from this is one of the funniest films of the year
