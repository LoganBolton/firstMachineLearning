i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didnt know what to expect the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow makefunofthevirgin humor what a great surprise i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor okthis is not a movie to go to with your grandmother jack palance or small children the language is filthy the jokes are very crude and the sex talk is about as graphic as youll find anywhere whats amazing however is that the movie is still a sweet love story my girlfriend and i both loved it steve carell is terrific but like the office the supporting cast really makes the film work all of the characters have their flaws but they also have depth and likability everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect i cant wait to get the dvd im sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines
