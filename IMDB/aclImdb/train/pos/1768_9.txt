i havent laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the moviebr br kudos to steve carrellwho i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i havent seen before and catherine keener is excellent as always thank god there wasnt a cameo from will ferrelllove him but saw him too much this summerbr br there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell and partly thanks to the writingalso carrell the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hystericalbr br i will definitely go see 40 year old virgin when its released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it
