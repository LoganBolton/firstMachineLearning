just came out of a sneak preview for this film it had me laughing every 30 secs the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadnt bought that large coke there are definitely some lulls but overall highly entertaining the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in bruce almighty and will ferrell anchorman the legend of ron burgendy in their movies paul rudd is hilarious as always i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like ps i think that seth rogen should be getting more work because he so freaking talented and engaging leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac however if youre easily offended dont see this movie if youre a rabid feminist dont see this movie and please not matter what even if you think youre one of those hip parents dont take your kids to this movie sure you should let your teens go see this movie just dont watch it with them it would make for some incredibly awkward moments
