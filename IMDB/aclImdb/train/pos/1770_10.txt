in the previews the 40 yearold virgin boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasnt too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely and then the unexpected happens he falls in love whats more theres a movie out about it and its called the 40 yearold virginbr br the virgin of the title is andy stitzer steve carell who is indeed 40 works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see he has a lovely home theater system and watches survivor with his two kind elderly neighbors hes a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more womenbr br now heres the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute mature fashion this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community which are in no way meant to be taken as gaybashing as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game mortal kombat deception no less  the ultimate testosteronedriven fightfest for guysbr br as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similarthemed movie could never have been i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past 40 a bit arrogant i know but would you you is italicized still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of the 40 yearold virginbr br of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise dont ask and hes pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex when its first discovered andy is a virgin at 40 his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen all at first assume hes gay because hes never been with a woman which couldnt be any further from the truth the truth is andy loves women but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the sidelines for goodbr br david jay and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid so help them all but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster as proved by one date with nicky leslie mann who puts andy through the worst drunkdriving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth elizabeth banks the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiendbr br things brighten up for andy when he meets trish catherine keener the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people hmmm and with that nicelooking collection of action figures you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him that is if he can ever do the deedbr br at last this is the sex romp weve been waiting for it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but lets look at the big picture how many of us lonely guys want to be a lonely guy forever the important thing were taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself i dont think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does which is sidesplitting to be honest and according to this website and various other news articles was in fact real and so was the blood on carells shirt afterwardbr br the 40 yearold virgin was directed by judd apatow and cowritten by himself and carell which originated as a skit that starred carell carell is sweet and human as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut this is probably one of the most intelligent romps ive ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect even carells buddies who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities can be related to on a fundamental levelbr br the way the 40 yearold virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end but ill leave that up to you the viewer to observe surely if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener then its true it is never too latebr br 1010
