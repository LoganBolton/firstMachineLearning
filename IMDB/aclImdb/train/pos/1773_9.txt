barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time after its transmission in the early 80s and one repeat its since sunk without trace this is a crying shamebr br i originally watched this when it was transmitted in the southern tv region on sunday afternoons and was classic teatime viewing although i dont remember a great deal about the program a few things stuck in my mind most notable were the unforgettable titles the mournful flute music accompanying the attempted escape across an east european border and the subsequent car crash and that scene has left me with an abiding love of fintail mercedes models as they used a merc 200 although it wasnt obvious at the start the solution to the series mystery was in these titlesbr br the plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had lots of twists and turns but barriers was a surprisingly adult childrens drama benedict taylor was excellent as billy and it was a shame he didnt do a lot morebr br this was a quality drama well overdue for a dvd release and i hope ill get the chance to reacquaint myself with it in the futurebr br a fond memory from my childhood
