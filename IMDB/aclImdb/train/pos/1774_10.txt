having set the sitcom world alight with father ted arthur matthews and graham linehans next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called hippies although created by the pair the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alonebr br set in london in 1969 ray purbs a hippy is the editor of an anarchist magazine his friends are his flatmate the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex his girlfriend is feminist jill and the none too bright hugobr br simon pegg was superb as ray but he is superb in everything he is in this sitcom had a feel of citizen smith about it ray was very much like wolfie smith trying to beat society but failing miserably at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march i cant wait to buy it as it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television my memories arent too good of the sitcom yet i remember two episodes really clearly the first being the opener protesting hippies which i thought was a great start where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was hippy dippy hippies which i think was episode 4 again quite a clear memory about the police sadly the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers i cant think why the bbc commissioned another series but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction oh well i cant wait for the dvdbr br best episode hippy dippy hippies series 1 episode 4
