i hated the first episode of this show  protesting hippies  so much in 1999 that i shunned the rest however when it came on the paramount comedy channel i watched it in full and to my surprise found it absolutely hilarious  motto never judge a comedy series in its first week  br br set in 1969 hippies stars simon pegg as ray purbbs editor of an ozlike underground magazine called mouth his friends are the feminist jill laidback alex and the halfwit hugo back in the late 60s there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read rather than sneering at the hippies naivety hippies is affectionate towards it arthur mathews scripts cheekily parody a number of that eras icons  hair woodstock the graduate even the infamous oz obscenity trial of the early 70s excellent performances from the cast julian rhindtutts alex strangely put me in mind of the richard osullivan character from man about the house its a shame that there was never a second series possibly because of people like me if you missed hippies give it a try once you get past the dire opener youre in for a treat
