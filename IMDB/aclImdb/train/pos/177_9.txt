this is a feelgood movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it skims over political issues but so what i am sure she wasnt trying to make good night and good luck here lets not try to make it anything else but what it islight fare br br and very enjoyable at thatbr br do we remember what 1984 was like weve become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to differ on this point goldie knew this was funfluff and she went ahead and did itbr br like her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of outoftowners goldie knows what she is doingshe plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really wellbr br she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently i loved her in laughin and every thing shes ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she isand thats that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and youve just got to lighten up because before you know ityou are old wrinkled and suffering from one of lifes inevitable ailments if it even comes that latebr br i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
