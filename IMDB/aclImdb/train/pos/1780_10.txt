my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east mainly massachusetts when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in boston now i dont know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational the first movie we saw was this one the romeo division now i dont know about you but i thought this was great im from texas and where i come from we dont see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise my mother insisted that it was too violent but said that i didnt know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great also i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys this was true brilliance im not sure when its getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out i think youll be pleasantly surprised a word to the wise though it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch its more for adults
