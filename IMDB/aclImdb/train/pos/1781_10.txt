here comes the romeo division to change the paradigmbr br let me just say that i was blown away by this short film i saw it randomly when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since i really truly believe i was part of a happening like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streetsbr br i am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but i so hope i can be there for itbr br again a truly incredible piece of film making
