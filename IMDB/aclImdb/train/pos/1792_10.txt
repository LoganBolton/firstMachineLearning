i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death i have had many such losses and this movie spoke to me one of the major themes is how we dont deal with questionsissuesstories with our loved ones until its too latetheyre too incapacitated or dead before that happens talk to your loved ones listen to and record their stories tell people you love them resolve differences i loved the message that there are no mistakes i love the directors portrayal of the relationship of the two daughtersas one of six siblings its clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clearwhat a beautiful movie the casting is outstandinga film not to be missed
