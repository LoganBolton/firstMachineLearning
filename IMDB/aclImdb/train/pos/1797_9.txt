since starting to read the book this movie is based on im having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book ive ever seen it would probably not have matteredbr br im trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan mintons book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of itbr br its not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel im feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said its not so much that some novels dont deserve to be a movie its more like some books just cant make the transition ms mintons novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms mintons work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its valuebr br i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since im only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess im writing this because i feel that if youre going to adapt a novel adapt it but dont make it something else that its not im not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone elses work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but its too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its ownbr br thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are
