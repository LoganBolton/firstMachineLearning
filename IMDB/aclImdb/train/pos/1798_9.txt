saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival and its a sticktoyourbones movie  its really stayed with me adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel its a backandforthintime drama with fully rounded characters thoughtful rumination on life choices and im not exaggerating one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100 years of moviemaking wonderful work from everyone led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying deluded newport matron and claire danes as her much younger self meryl streeps daughter mamie gummer is like mama the real deal patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and doesnt overplay the charm and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp detailed cameos hugh dancy also from the stage doesnt bring much edge to the somewhat clich√©d role of an unhappy rich wastrel and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow but its a deliberately paced visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like youre being recklessly manipulated also what a sumptuous parade of 1940s50s automobiles
