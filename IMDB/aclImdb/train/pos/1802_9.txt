okay i saw this movie as a child and really loved it my parents never purchased the movie for me but i think ill go about and buy it now im a sucker for pre2000 animated films anyway onto the actual reviewbr br what i liked there was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell one of the few ive seen in animated films character development existed its easy to classify characters in this movie ie charlie is the selfish mutt itchy is cynical but believes charlie carface is obviously the relentless villain etc i also loved king gators song ive always loved loud annoying flamboyant guys this song may have been random but it was so fun finally the detail of the animation was beautiful you could tell charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautifulbr br what i did not like the actual portrayal of heaven the way charlie reacted to it no surprises whatsoever made it actually seem very boring he denied a place in heaven and still got to return to it in the end i remember a few lines of certain songs such as  you cant keep a good dog down  lets make music forever and  welcome to being dead but i cant remember the majority of any of them the songs werent that catchy to be honest whippet angel shes annoying and that neck aughbr br what parents may not like a few very scary depending on the viewer images of hell are shown during the movie carface is quite threatening beer is also implied but not actually dubbed beer gambling is a key element in the movie the good guy diesbr br overall i love this movie even if it is a bit forgettable at times the scarier childrens animations are always my favorite ones this was created back in a time when producers and writers werent afraid to give kids a little scare now and then nowadays this probably would have been rated pg kids under the age of 8 or easily disturbed kids should not watch this other than that i give it 910 br br happy viewing
