i wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep there was get this character development and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme if not for the handful of songanddance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why i give it such a high rating this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids movie ive seen in quite some time this coming from a 22yearold id be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ala jurassic bark for those of you who are futurama fans and this is what makes this movie so good just because the movie universally evokes emotions we dont normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad in fact it means it succeeded good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh good horror movies are supposed to make us scared good sad movies are supposed to make us sad my point is good movies are supposed to move you not simply entertain this movie moved mebr br also this movie is incredibly violent by todays standards for a kids movie and contains subject matter that by todays standards may not be suitable for some children parents id say watch it first im not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me
