all dogs go to heaven is an animated kids movie like no other gambling drinking death guns and hell are all prominent in the plot and though kids will get very little of it adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie the actual movie isnt explicit in any way its just an odd combination to make a kids movie onbr br charlie barkin burt reynolds is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner carface vic tayback after getting drunk a doggetting drunkin a kids movie it just sounds weird charlie is tricked and murdered by carfax when in heaven he finds a way to come back to earth but he will no longer be allowed in heaven he still goes back to earth and meets up with his old friend itchy dom deluise and plans payback on carfax meanwhile carfax has a little orphan girl anne marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals which helps predict races charlie and itchy free her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselvesbr br this movie is one of the few nondisney that will appeal to both kids and adults kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation while adults will enjoy the nice sweet plot and the more than normal developed characters one thing that keeps this down is that its a musical normally thats a good thing but the music here is honestly terrible they tend to jump around almost sounding ad libbed with next to no instrumental backing in fact these are probably the worst songs ive ever heard in an animated movie but luckily the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notesbr br the ending of this movie works but i honestly hate it its sad but happy but more sad than happy and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel considering how bad the sequel made to this was i wish the ending wouldnt have warranted a sequel and it wouldve wrapped up into a nice super happy ending this is one of the few movies i feel this way about but i dobr br overall this is a nice family film with odd themes thrown in but nonetheless good entertainmentbr br my rating  out of  85 mins g
