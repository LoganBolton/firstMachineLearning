when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else this ova is kinda the opposite though therere only half a dozen episodes it isnt filled with action but emotional things the two main action sequences in this i believe are enough to satisfy me after seeing so many gundam series movies and ovas i was completely ready for a civilianesquire movie this movie did a fantastic job of that what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where theyre depicted as the second rise of evil nazis most people that dont like anime that ive forced to watch this movie lol liked it so id recommend it to a lot of people just for the antiwar story if youre a gundam fan and havent seen this you shouldnt be reading this you should already be watching it right now
