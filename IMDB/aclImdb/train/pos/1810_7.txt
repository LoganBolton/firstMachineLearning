i can understand why some people like this movie and why some people dont for me though i really like it even if i noticed some good bits and not so impressive bits the animation was actually excellent like charlies dream the characters were a mixed bag the best being annemarie voiced by the late judith barsii was physically ill when i read what happened to her also carface is a very convincing villainespecially voiced by the wonderful vic taybacki particularly loved morons im surrounded by morons and along with rasputin and warren trat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle but i loved king gator and his song some of the film is very haunting like annabelles you can never come come back which kind of scares me still unfortunately there were some bits i didnt like so much the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused but disneys black cauldron suffered from the same problem also there were some dark scenes that young children would find upsetting but the ending is very poignant however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung none of them in particular stick out with exception of lets make music together and love survives and burt reynolds cant sing and dom deluise has done much better singing all in all a watchable movie that could have been more but is definitely memorable and i would definitely watch it again 710 bethany cox
