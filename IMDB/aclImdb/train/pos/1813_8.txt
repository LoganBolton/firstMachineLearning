in my case i liked this movie because when i saw it i found more than i expected i mean this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after i finished it talks about death vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the midpoint of the film thats what makes this movie so good the ability unique in don bluth director to play with the peoples feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time that and the fact that it has so many good characters like charlie and annmarie that in the sad but happy ending you have to say i have something in my eye to hide the others that you cried all ive said are just only some of the good points of this movie as for the rest you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest don bluth thank you
