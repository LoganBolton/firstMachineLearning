i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little im 22 years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and im shocked honestly by this rating of 58 i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and funbr br charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that cant stop ticking or thats the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl annmarie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put annmarie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeancebr br all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film its not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that its just so cute and touching i know its ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not theyre just so loving and i think im going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone its a fun movie to watchbr br 710
