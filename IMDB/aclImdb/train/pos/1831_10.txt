this movie was rather awful vipul shahs last movie was good this one was just bad although its a good story and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play avjo wahala fari malishu made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but its still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and dont work well but theyre still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch its still a story to take in to account and its good if youre the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor thats really not needed even one bit
