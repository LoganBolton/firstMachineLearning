what a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe i dont know how come the rating of the movie is 73 it should be 93 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect you should watch this movie once i think twice well its up to u anyways i love this movie and its not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya the only thing i dont like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if a r rahman would be the music director but anyways we cant do anything about that so ya
