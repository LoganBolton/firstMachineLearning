like his elder brothers claude sautet and jeanpierre melville alain corneau began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers la menace 1977 and série noire 1979 among others police python 357 is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career they had a splendid cinematography painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiencys sakebr br the police superintendent ferrot yves montand is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia léopardi stefania sandrelli and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover his superior ganay françois périer when the latter learns it he kills her in a fit of anger ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against himbr br one could deem that this kind of farfetched story isnt exempt from glitches and sometimes one can see right through it but corneaus pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling dusky atmosphere the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however it is crucial for what will follow this keymoment corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation in spite of drawbacks corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story ménard mathieu carrière who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation but his superior knows that he usually works alone actually ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself eventually the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself hes a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses wont recognize him when he is brought face to face with thembr br the backdrop of this thriller orléans is efficiently enhanced by corneaus camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm
