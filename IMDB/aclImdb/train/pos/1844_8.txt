i wasnt quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but as it turns out this is a pretty good show no small thanks to talented casting four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goingson of their lovelives the hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite sharon smalls trudi is the homemaker one allegedly widowed after september 11th who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors its great to see small back on tv as she was great in the inspector lynley mysteries the chick can act orla bradys character siobhan a lawyer is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women as she wrestles with her kind but selfabsorbed husband hari jaffrey formerly of spooks in his driven desire to have a child with her regardless of her needs the final two members of the cast are the effervescent jess shellie conn an events planner whos a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone gender not specific and katie sarah parrish a somber doctor whos affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control that being said im hooked now and hope that the bbc continues cranking this series out because its good its different and its got a great cast
