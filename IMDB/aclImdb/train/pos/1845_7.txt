why this is called mistresses is a puzzle because its about four women three of whom arent mistressesÂ… except wait ah i see its a salacious title and we all have to merchandise i suppose the series itself delicious most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves great fun reminds me of lwts 1976 miniseries bouquet of barbed wire where every character and their dads wielded the machetebr br siobhan orla brady is the only actual mistress and shes getting herself in proper trouble husband is infertile so no chance of a baby there then but at work theres dominic played by ubersexy adam rayner who looks so good that theres no surprise when heavy lust breaks out dominic it turns out has no fertility problems i expect his sperms do swashbuckling  probably each carries a little sword  and now siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead what siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight and go with  its a miracle what she actually does of course is say to her friends i have to tell my husband no you dont really you dont stop stopbr br katie sarah parish was a mistress once for we learn that shed had an affair with a married man before the series started unwisely shes now taken up with his son the father died of cancer and katie who is a doctor helped him on his journey so shes an euthanasiarist has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones its not going to end well for katiebr br jessica is an experimental lesbian she arranges events and shes busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway she quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides alex played by anna torv and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste however it cant think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together so it invents a very lame youre not having a hen night well i cant let you get away with that ill organise one and the guests shall be  me which achieves the result but isnt exactly winterson i thought script writers were supposed to earn their living lazy torvs interpretation of her character is good alex treats jessica as possibly unsavoury and alexs body language always points backwards when shes moving forward mind once shes over the wall in she happily goes and unsurprisingly for shelley conn is so mouthwatering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chancebr br which brings us to trudi whos a widow of course there should be plain people in a community but if youre going to have a plain character then you have to invent something to admire in them its quite possible to be a lump and engaging however smalls trudi looks like one of those characters that casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said thats ridiculous not every single character would be pretty more tellingly you cant find anything to admire in her nothing shes a turnip in a bowl of apples appallingly she does sexy from time to time i wont forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time and for all the wrong reasonsbr br so good delinquent fun all round theres easily enough material here for a second series and i hope that they do one i trust they learn one lesson though the characters never take off their underclothes in bed having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust afterwards they surface still wearing their bras or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits after several episodes no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock whats this early 21st century puritanism so production team are you listening your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they do abandon as well as talk it at least theyll have more fun in the fun scenes poor things in a series dominated by either being in the bedroom or wanted to be in the bedroom or having just been in the bedroom its a bit silly and jars a lot that the characters bonk in their underwearbr br overall i was going to score 6 top end medium but the series does one trick thats rare enough when each episode ends you always want more and you look forward to the next one with anticipation so i score 7
