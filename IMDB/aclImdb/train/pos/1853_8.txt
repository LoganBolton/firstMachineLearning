well its yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film but im a sucker for those so i gave it a good score the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change id have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end all in all a good movie with very good actorsbr br
