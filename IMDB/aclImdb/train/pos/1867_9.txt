this is a film about life the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie this is more than just a tearjerker its an engaging thoughtprovoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington 7 years on im amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film nevertheless apart from a slow buildup the story of this foster childs trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it like many fox searchlight pictures this was more of a sleeper hit and didnt get the mass critical acclaim it deserves the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear while antowne asked simply why her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything what could she say to defend herself one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen
