this movie is great it touched my stone cold heart i couldnt relate about the racial discrimination that antwone has experienced because im living in my own country i guess it is really hard to be discriminatedbr br we watched this film in our sociology class in new era universityand i didnt knew that it was a true story i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry it is very goodbr br the part that shocked me was when nadine abused antwone who was just six sexually if i were on his shoes i could have jumped a tenstory high building i salute him for he being so strongbr br the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face he did not bitched her or whateverinstead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated i think ill do that when i get the chance of tracing my roots
