this is one of my favorite comedies ever not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero but taken for what its worth and not as trivializing alcoholism the movie is simply a lot of fun it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune but only if he marries susan chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him arthur proposes but then unwisely falls for linda a waitress and petty thiefbr br dudley moore is perfect as arthur the worlds most endearing drunk whose antics are a laugh a minute admittedly moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed liza minnelli sparkles as linda and her on screen chemistry with moore is great jill clayburgh plays susan the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur br br however this film is literally made by sir john gielgud who portrays arthurs sarcastic but moral butler hobson its obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobsons longtime employment hobson is arthurs best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthurs romance at all but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant its the butler youll remember best long after the closing credits roll
