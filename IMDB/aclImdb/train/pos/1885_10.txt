this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old grainy vhs versionsbr br i hadnt seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time its one of those rare perfect storms of comedy where great writing truly funny line after truly funny line is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same timebr br dudley moore got an oscar nomination for arthur but lost although john gielgud won for best supporting actor if moores performance in arthur doesnt win a best actor oscar its proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title another example is gene wilder in young frankensteinbr br steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warmhearted tone of the story quite simply imho the movie is a rare gem its only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after arthur was releasedbr br regarding the dvd that is available as of 12007 its soso although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies there is still no widescreen version availablebr br the dvd has a few extras that are nice but its just not enough one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included because they were hysterical but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit the dvd being the perfect format to include such material certainly should have offered it as wellbr br this the original arthur is a classic comedy that is one for the books
