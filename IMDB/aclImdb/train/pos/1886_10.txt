i have loved this movie ever since its debut in 1981 i have lost track of how many times i have seen it it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song i think i quote this movie without realizing it i basically know the entire script so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it i cant even narrow it down although sir johns character probably gets the most memorable ones the famous ill alert the media when arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless but the list is truly endless the scenes at arthurs soon to be fianc√©s fathers house are a scream particularly his interactions with the moose do yourself a favour and see this movie
