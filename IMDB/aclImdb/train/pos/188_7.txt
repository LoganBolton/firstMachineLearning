im a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies a lot of silent films dont hold my attention but show people is a notable exceptionbr br marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriouslybr br show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film i know that doesnt make much sense but thats what happened the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessarybr br show people is a perfect introduction to silent films it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent eras best stars add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the must see list for all classic film buffs
