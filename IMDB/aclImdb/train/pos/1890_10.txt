this is one of those movies that ive seen so many times that i can quote most of it some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moosebr br i dont know how many times i have seen this sequence but its funny every time from the moment arthur gets to susans dads place to the bit with the moose you pretty much laugh the whole time i remember watching the outtakes regarding the bit with the moose it went down just like id imagined itd be like they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film itbr br the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this his demeanor his oneliners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious its always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him hes a spoiled little  i laugh every time i listen to the im going to have a bath and the lines that follow
