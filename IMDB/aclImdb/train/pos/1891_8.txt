when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically underutilised asset the late dudley moore was there should be a dozen movies like this in our archivebr br he was already topnotch talent before he went to hollywood both as a comedian and a musician but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook on television and in one or two indifferent british movies perhaps the best of these was bedazzled br br he always tended to be eclipsed by cook whos jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america arthur is the result br br this is a truly splendid movie moores clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lots of hilarious almost surreal conversational digressions there is something so british about him that im actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes tommy cooper an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank it is moores almost childish vulnerability that is so endearingbr br liza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him but still have some excellent oneliners john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar correct me if im wrong but he has never played any other comic rolebr br there is a followup movie called arthur 2  on the rocks it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches but it is still rather good even so guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost it is darker and there is some interesting soulsearching it will disappoint if you watch arthur firstbr br hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings he eventually returned to britain dejected and apparently dyingbr br but arthur is a sample of what might have been we can only imagine the other great movies he should have madebr br yourre sadly missed dudley
