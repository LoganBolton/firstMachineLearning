again it seems totally illogical to me at least that arthur merits a mere 64 out of 10 possible steve gordons oneshot masterpiece herein is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible melding of wildly disparate elements that he managed to make alcoholism laughfriendly rather than tearjerking tragic is in itself wonderful that he gave dudley moore his finest role and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact including the score seems to me patent and egregious i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud but apparently nearly a third of its audience has so managed well i for one found and find gordons effort both laughable and lovable and the iikes of geraldine fitzgeralds greataunt and stephen elliotts murderous wouldbe fatherinlaw absolute gems of background characters even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization and the late sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee but wrong about undertaking his role arthur makes no effort to underztand much less rationalize the scourge of alcoholism hey ifit aint booze its other drugs of choice including meth and addictions are merely symptoms not targets it simply observes in its own quizzical manner
