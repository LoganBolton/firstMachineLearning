this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writerdirector steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud sadly gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film its an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at characterdriven farce that makes the whole film irresistible it plays almost like a 1930sstyle screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes the plot centers on arthur bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his 750 million inheritance if he doesnt marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson an heiress handpicked by his oldmoney father and dotty grandmother of course he doesnt love her and by chance runs into linda marolla a workingclass waitress and of course aspiring actress after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her fatherbr br the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcoholfueled slapstick executed with classic Ã©lan by moore that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielguds feisty acidic turn as hobson arthurs devoted but realitygrounded valet its the type of role he could play in his sleep but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings in probably her most likable film role liza minnelli hands the picture to her male costars by toning down her usual razzledazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivationbr br a prela law jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passiveaggressive note while barney martin jerrys dad on seinfeld steals all his scenes as lindas slovenly father ralph the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother and i have to admit that i still cant stand the very dated overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that years best song unfortunately the 1997 dvd certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes
