sadly 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter was the last sitcom that john ritter got to work on after his tragic death in 2003 he was one of my all time favourite actors he had it all comedy who can forget him in threes company but he was also an excellent dramatic actor unforgivable Â– worth watching tv movie as much i loved all the other cast members of the show katey amy kaley and martin john was the star he was much of the reason i was drawn to the show in the first place and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every timebr br i loved how the show wasnt all sugary sweet as much as i loved the cosby show come on they were too nice to each other lol they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly it was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the squabbles between parents but they still kept it funny a lot of american sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not and this show didnt do that yes there were some like tackling important issues such as drugs and bullying but they didnt try and be anything other than a fun family comedybr br the way they wrote johns death in to the show was brilliantly done i still sob like a baby each time i see it you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodesbr br im sad the show was cancelled i still enjoy watching the reruns and i never get tired of itbr br john ritter youll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy  you rock ritter
