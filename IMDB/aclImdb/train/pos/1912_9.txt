ill keep it short and brief the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius the actors are just perfect for the roles they play cjs character is legendary and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is a very successful comedybr br when i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over 67 months i wondered what had happened to paul i was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed google he was so funny and played his character to perfection an overprotective dad who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from boysbr br the comedy i think has gone from strength to strength even without paul in itbr br plus i think most people would enjoy this watching it
