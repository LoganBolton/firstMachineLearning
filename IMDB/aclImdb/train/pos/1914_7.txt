eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the showbr br i have always preferred kerry to bridget bridget has been done before kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although im not sure i like the direction her character went in later seriesbr br early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids however i think the show lost its sparkle when john ritter died i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dadbr br bridget seemed to get more annoying rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring lifes lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul i think the granddad is funny especially when hes watching great escape but feel cj is unnecessary to the show he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series over all the newer ones arent bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and cj and granddads always there too i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry but later ones were about average at best
