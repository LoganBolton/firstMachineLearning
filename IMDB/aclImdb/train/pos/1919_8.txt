i have not read the book that this was based uponinspired by this being some ofthe others are film roles the last work of john ritterrip one hopes that it is hilarious and it is almost every time hes present in this as a matter of fact most of the cast supporting as well as regular play off each other well and the material tends to be great he plays paul hennessy the father of three teenagers rory the typical guy of that age kerry the depressive middlechild who fights for causes and awareness and bridget the fashionloving popular ditz sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sitcom and her character is far removed from peggy bundy the show changed somewhat after mr threes company passed on and for a while they couldnt seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs or being poignant and making sure to be respectful one can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that it could still be quite good some of the additions were fortunateif you like david spade most of his part consists of him doing his schtick and had stuff to say my personal favorite episode is in the last season the humor is a nice mix of dumb person jokesmainly related to the highschoolers silliness dark comedy and crude material this dealt with sex and other adult topics but never in a graphic manner the language is mild and on occasion moderately strong i recommend this to any fan of those who made it 810
