abc has done more for this show by allowing television veterans james garner and david spade to join the cast of this show at first the show was watchable and even predictable with john ritter and katey sagal johns loss shocked the world katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast the hour lesson after johns death in reallife struck home to me i lost my father at 17 years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony abc should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as johns final wish this show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances they should be rewarded with emmys
