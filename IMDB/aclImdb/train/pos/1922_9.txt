let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there upon his death the show did drop off a bit but the producers didnt give up on the show adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005br br the show centers around the hennessy family paul john ritter may he rest in peace his wife cate katey sagal their daughters bridget kaley cuoco kerry amy davidson and their son rory martin spanjers when ritter was on the show i would shriek in laughter and proud to admit it i am but now that hes gone ill only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh im very glad that i fell for this shows trance after ritters untimely death because it made the eps with ritter so much betterbr br ritters character is just so well acted and well rounded that you cant help but love him he is always bossing the girls around about dating but he really wants them to be happy its the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainmentbr br katey sagal is great as well and she too is a likable character after ritters death her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco davidson and spanjers because she and ritter had been friends for a long timebr br the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy played by kaley cuoco she is the ultimate blonde gorgeous slow dimwitted yet she is a smart person she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent blonde humor and how conceited she isbr br amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry but thats the purpose of her character the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about shes always after bridget and her character feels like its just thrown in therebr br martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical and when ritter is on the show hes mostly comic material upon the death of ritter the show does provide some story lines for rorybr br david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs with the occasional side story for cj spades character garner plays cates father as a bit of background informationbr br all in all i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it youll enjoy itbr br 910 spy
