this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment it takes the sugarysweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats brat brothers overprotective fathers and bimbo sisters im almost surprised its disneybr br to its credit 8 simple rules knows its a comedy and doesnt try to be more too many shows eg sister sister and lizzie mcguire think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hardhitting this is a trap 8 simple rules has avoided it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his characterbr br and i think although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark 8 simple rules can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesnt make cates father a second version of paul hennessy
