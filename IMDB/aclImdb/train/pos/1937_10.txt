i had the pleasure of screening the big bad swim at the 2006 new london film festival last week the festival highlights some of the best independent and nonmainstream films from the past year it was my assumption that the big bad swim was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around eastern connecticut however as the credits began to roll i could only think about how well the big bad swim compared to the others featured during the festival by far it topped my list followed by the puffy chair who killed the electric car and transamericabr br the the big bad swim is an engaging truthful and oftenhumorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that ive not seen on screen in quite a while the interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adultswimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which i found refreshing the plot doesnt beat you over the head with a direction rather it builds and grows organically with a pace that was spot on i was never bored i never cringed i never stepped out of the story on the screenbr br the humor of the film is something like napoleon dynamite meets old school the acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived obviously not being a multimillion production the camera shot werent all aweinspiring and clear but adequate and well done for the budget the lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in closer i also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could bebr br i sure its said over and over from many in the independent film industry but i have to say it if the big bad swim isnt picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed the big bad swim needs to be seen if you have the chance to see this film see it disappointment is impossible
