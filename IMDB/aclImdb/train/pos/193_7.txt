sunday july 16 800pm the castro san franciscobr br as a southern colonel your makeup is very indianabr br the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving is often speculated considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some validity as a comedienne however her star shone very brightly left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand one of her better outings was king vidors show people 1928 which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wisecracker william haines rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama and dont think she didnt spend the rest of her life reminding everyone with von stroheim walsh and demille coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before think of who worked therebr br colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper dell henderson drives his daughter peggy davies from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone haines   a custard pie artist  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance watch for the bit with the noodle and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her    all the stars have to take it on the chin   at the preview billy and peggy bump into  charlie chaplin who asks for her autograph she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed so naturally she faints its so very funny considering davies character isnt supposed to recognize this guy peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios changes her name to patricia pepoire and leaves poor billy behind davies does a wonderful sendup of a serious actress with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot and theyre all sitting shoulder to shoulder facing the camera that includes polly moran whos also sensationally funny playing davies maid louella parsons one of the friendly vampires estelle taylor claire windsor aileen pringle the comedy duo of karl dane with his arm in a sling and george k arthur pretending hes stealing the silverware leatrice joy amused by arthurs antics renee adoree rod eating and smoking la rocque mae murray john in a robe gilbert who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture norma eeeww talmadge looking bitchy and aloof as usual and patricia dressed like marie antoinette sandwiched between douglas fairbanks as he does an amusing trick and william s hart protecting her from doug billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggys current production also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick sidney bracy as the dramatic director who cant get peggy to cry for her screen test and then cant stop her once she does and paul ralli as andre her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony when her character tries to act its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas shed been forced into and shes brilliant doing itbr br while its true show people is a hokey satire of the good ole days ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving thalberg and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent what a shame so much has been lost there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy 1928 vidor and davies hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed
