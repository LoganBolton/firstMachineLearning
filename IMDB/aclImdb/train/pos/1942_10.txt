i consider myself a huge movie buff i was sick on the couch and popped in this film right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors id never seen say great word the filming was beautiful it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout thanku for making a film like this one just wonderfully awkward beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once just great i cant submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer i didnt want it to end the end
