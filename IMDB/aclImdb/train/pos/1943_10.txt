i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 moving picture festival in birmingham alabama i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an encore screeningbr br when i think of the films that are shown at festivals i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat often with the feel of an elaborate student project theres nothing wrong with these types of projects of course and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent filmmaking by mainstream i mean more like a film produced for national release  in other words a movie that you would see in a regular movie theaterbr br the writing directing cinematography casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro there is nothing typically independent about this film as an aspiring director i am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going this is one of those films as i watched the big bad swim my motivation level was incredible i felt like my adrenaline had kicked in the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long putoff project when a movie makes me feel like that i know its really good this is the first featurelength project from ishai setton and i found myself wishing that it had been my project for me thats really rarebr br see this film its beautifully shot and directed and the casting is excellent paget brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance she has a quality about her a charisma that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend thats a gift i think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often jeff branson and jess weixler also did topnotch jobs i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production
