this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other it should have managed a wider distribution as its much better than similar films from major studios out at the same timebr br the swimming instructor is an almostolympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students he attempts more or less to fend them off with varying resultsbr br the students characters are mainstream usa teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom havent learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guysbr br this is a good date movie or just one to watch when youre in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality
