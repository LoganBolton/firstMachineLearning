the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd i only had 1 to 3 on video before that because kes is my favourite character and have just reached the end i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it am i satisfied with the ending i think i am naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but thats left to our imagination in many ways endgame is similar to next gens all good thingsÂ… the involvement of the crew in the future but mainly the captain a new romance starting in the finale troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here which results in death in the future i truly loved endgame fair to all characters neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier belanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important the doctor in the future is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe but of course the captain has the largest role meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties the borg are involved as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically just her voice and acting method are magnificent i feel sorry for susanna thompson though the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen maybe she wasnt available though the special effects are fantastic the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart its very tense especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought theyd be after theyd said theyd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse voyager could have continued if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home like in harrys speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there and then they could have got home in a filmbr br overall voyager was a bit hit and miss the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible my perception of seven of nine was that she took over it all revolved around her which wasnt true when she first appeared season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that and her character is ingenious at times 20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity i like her especially in someone to watch over me imperfection and human error when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side that was lovely chakotay became my least favourite character gone was the chemistry with janeway will theywont they and youd never think he was first officer hes completely pushed aside most of the time i loved seeing tom and belannas relationship blossom against the odds i always liked neelix a lot tuvok was good at times especially when he lost his logic gained emotion and was friends with neelix harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times the doctor is probably my favourite seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates tinker tenor doctor spy is fantastic janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it br br i wish there was more i love voyager
