i thought this movie did a down right good job it wasnt as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole lotta fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on dvd im going to pay the money for it very proudly every last cent sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horriblecatwoman but this movie isnt this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs dont wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it dont expect a masterpiece or something thats gripping and soul touching just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirsbr br all in all this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who havent seen it see it because what the critics and box office say doesnt always count see it for yourself you never know you might just enjoy it i tip my hat to this moviebr br 810
