really i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film in fact the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertainingbr br yes the script is a little convoluted but thats the genre the film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale just like all the old noir classics this too has a screenplay that twists you around so that you dont always know how to make sense of it at first and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together thats the genre in general the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and in turn surprised without abandoning the viewerbr br sharon stone is also an easy target the truth is she looks great and she speaks her doubleentendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious sexy and funbr br the direction is more than passable because lets face ityou have to keep an audience interested in the did she or didnt she question for two hours in addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by stone this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time with straight industrial lines to go along with stones sexy curves the frame is always beautifulpress pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eyebr br the film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real particularly the sex katherine tramell is bisexualhow shocking becomes treated more matteroffactly here and typically the sexuality of the film is used to better effect it is still titillating but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first i wont say that it isnt still somewhat of a gimmick because lets face it this film is supposed to be funbr br and a fun film it is it may be an easy target but if you watch it for what it is a noirish femmefatale driven twisty sexy didsheordidntshe whodunnit youre bound to enjoy it no pun intended
