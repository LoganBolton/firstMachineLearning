yes ill say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underratedbr br sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mindbr br the acting was good apart from thewlisbr br stone really has a talent with this role shes slick naughty and seductive and doesnt look a day older than she did in the firstshe really impressed melike in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was overthetop the whole way he really suckedbr br overall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis
