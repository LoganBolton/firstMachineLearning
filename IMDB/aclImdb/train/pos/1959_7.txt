let me be upfront i like pulp however it is like one of these easier dives that you see at the olympics it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of say a late medieval painterbr br this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often or more accurately most of the time ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains if not always in the right way check out the memorable quotes section for a chucklebr br however quite why it has been given a worst film razzie is baffling  i bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006 but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim br br head case and popular novelist catherine tramell sharon stone is now over in london writing a novel but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather god heavens she cant even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood stylebr br yes clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around if you like your pulse to be above zero but is she personally responsible i mean why would anyone put twoandtwo together and start thinking she might be a murderer equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual however is this just a personality disorder some form of bs risk addiction or further evidence of her guilt br br for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass david morrissey for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another lover found dead in mysterious circumstances thankfully for stone he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled homeworking life of his own in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blurbr br in to this heady mix comes roy washburn a strange welsh sounding david thewlis who tells the love struck doctor  in his capacity of policeman of many years standing  that the lady in question may be dangerous i mean hold the front page however glass is now too glassyeyed to realise or care like a dizzy boxer in front of a primetime mike tyson he ripe for the big takedown however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himselfbr br now comes millena gardosh charlotte rampling a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example in this film of someone who isnt barking mad or else a murder suspect presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stones  thankfully for us at least those days are long gone strangely she doesnt think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else  or else she doesnt think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper actingbr br after several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliffhangertwist that while as farcical as the rest of the movie gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct 3  highly unlikely this may be at this point in time
