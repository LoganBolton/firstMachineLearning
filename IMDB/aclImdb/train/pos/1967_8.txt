i dont understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad unless im just off my rocker i found it sick brilliant twisted and psychologically sophisticated you wont get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by stoneand a plot that will keep you guessing even after its over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48and that michael douglas isnt in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out give it a shot you might be glad you did
