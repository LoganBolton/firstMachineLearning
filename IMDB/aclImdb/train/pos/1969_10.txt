frankly i dont understand why this movie has been such a big flop in publicity sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and touch since basic instinct i voted this film 10 and i tell you why game opens in london this time london is the city where catherine tramell has moved since the events in bi1 again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class unchallenged she is screwing your brain as catherine with such a skill that in the end you dont be quite sure who is the real villainbr br as for the technical part of the film only real setback is the brate crew of actors sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part i also think bi2 would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma her brate assistants are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the castbr br i think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot i think this is a far better thriller than many of the runoffthemill crap hollywood so readily distributes these days the plot is great its easy to see technically you dont snore in the half way through the film and most important the heath is on
