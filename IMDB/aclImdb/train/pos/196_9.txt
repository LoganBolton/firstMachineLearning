this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style that could be termed zany beauty vidors direction is light but surehanded the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the starwatching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a kneejerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude br br
