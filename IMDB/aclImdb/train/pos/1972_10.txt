i dont understand your objections to this movie it is a taut thrilling extension of the character created in basic instinct the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that sharon stones character is still alive and not in jail at this late datebr br spoiler alert as the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on 1 sharon stones character is killing all these people because shes crazy risk addicted 2 david thewlis crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stones character 3 david morrisseys analyst is killing these people for revenge what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop the only killing that occurs on screenbr br i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 a space odyssey who cares what is real the blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge whats important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie get over it
