i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle lets face it she looks good shes light years hotter than my mother whos the same age its not an oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century thats all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul as such it never claims to be either its an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate its the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queenbr br the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure the score is amazing as wellbr br sure theres some overacting from some characters but theres some brilliant work from david morrissey whos virtually unknownbr br theres a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guiltypleasure raunchiness that the story is known forbr br at the very least its entertaining and fun to look at it and thats the movies only intentions so if youve got beef with mizz stone maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit
