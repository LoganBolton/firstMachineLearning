wisecracker the biography of actor william haines offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he costarred with marion davies beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised and no doubt relieved at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice its still funny and its satirical points still resonate needless to say the technology of moviemaking has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves havent changed all that muchbr br show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a firstrate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst its well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas by the late 20s for whatever reason marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies including the red mill and the patsy but show people directed by the great king vidor stands as her most enjoyable showcase william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone but this is the leading ladys show all the waybr br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star her dad colonel pepper is played by actordirector dell henderson a veteran of griffiths biograph dramas whocoincidentallyresembled hearst one of marions funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray sorrow    joy and drops a handkerchief across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture shes hired only to discover that comet makes lowbrow comedies the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue of course comet is intended as a takeoff of mack sennetts keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress at some point it may occur to us as it surely did to viewers in 1928 that davies rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b demille and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously giving the highhat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone davies performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoires spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spoton impersonation of swanson i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was releasedbr br in any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia peppoires autograph and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a selfmocking cameo appearance evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin in the rain among hollywoods most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused selfexamination
