as a child i always hated being forced to sit through musicals i never understood why people would break out into song like that and i was far too young to appreciate the artistry choreography set design costumes pacing behind it all carol reeds oliver was the one musical i remember oddly enjoying as a child probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately drenched in the spirit of dickensian squalor this is a musical about ghetto life in victorian london and while the scenery and set designs are stark dark and true to that way of life it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery upon a recent viewing my first since childhood i have some new thoughts and insights into why this musical works in that bizarre breaking out into song kind of way and why most just dont do it for mebr br when musicals work or really say something it is because they realize their own inherent strangeness lars von triers dancer in the dark as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist an immigrant obsessed with hollywood musicals likewise the very cynical and enjoyable chicago worked on a similar level because the musical numbers were the products of a homicidal ingenue singerdancer musicals dont work when they take their own musicalnature too seriously like in moulin rouge or are simply too much fluff about nothing ie something pointless like mary poppins upon viewing oliver for the first time as an adult i saw it in a new light told mostly from the point of view young oliver i saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of coping with the horrors of ghetto life around him the best musical number was probably when nancy got everyone in the tavern signing and dancing about the joys of getting drunk as a cover to help poor oliver escape the clutches of the evil bill sykes it was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano there are other great and classic tunes to be heard here and the direction and acting from the leads to the dancing extras are all top notchbr br still for all its bleakness although it does have a happy ending for oliver at least though certainly things didnt end happily for nancy and unless you think a life on the streets being a pickpocket is fun it wasnt a necessarily a good ending for fagin or the dodger despite their peppy closing tune i wouldnt really classify this as a family film though i dont think showing it to kids over the age of seven or eight will do any harm this is a harsh tale about an unfortunate orphan trying to survive on the streets and find some happiness i think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how perhaps a revisionist take on it where people on the streets of compton break into happy songs about their horrible lives id like to see a hardedged hiphop version of oliver i always thought dickens would translate well in those regards as it stands oliver was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest grated film ive ever seen
