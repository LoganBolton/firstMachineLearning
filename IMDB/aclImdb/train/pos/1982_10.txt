this was my favourite film as a child and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and i doubt anybody could ever remake the story of oliver twist on screen any better than this one didbr br my alltime favourite bad guy has to be oliver reed as bill sikes not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a 6 year old but now as a woman i can empathize more with nancys character the bar maidprostitute who helps oliver get the life he deservesbr br jack wilde as the artful dodger was fantastic and i dont think anybody could ever outdo him as the streetpocket picker and best friend of fagin the music is fantastic especially fagins numbers im also quite thankful they didnt give bill sikes a musical number it wouldnt of worked with him being such a sinister characterbr br i think carol reed did an excellent job of nancys sticky ending keeping it a g rated movie by disguising her beating but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her br br this movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical singalong as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life
