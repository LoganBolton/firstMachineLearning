i saw this recently on a cable channel the movie is great its one of the few musicals i have seen that doesnt shy away from the light and dark it portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on i didnt know where to look next one day i shall go and see this on the big screen just so that i see whats happening but what really lifts this to another level is oliver reeds performance as bill sykes not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else some inner demons he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner he was capable of anything it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness just awaiting the trigger i have seen the robert newtons bill sykes from the 1948 movie and i thought he was just a bad egg but oliver reeds performance intimidated me in my own living room
