im not usually a lover of musicalsbut if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliverthis film is so well madethe characters are well depictedthe costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are greatmy favourite being reviewing the situationsung by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagini wasnt old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters wereso for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songsusually it was who will buy my wonderful rosesso i already knew all of the songs before i saw the filmits a timeless musical you definitely couldnt remake itit stands on its ownits not accurate to the book and i dont think it would have worked so well if it had beeni dont think charles dickens would be disappointedas he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in londonthe orphanagesthe work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to surviveand the film portrays this very wellalso another great reason to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terriernotice his long thin legsthis was bred out of the breed many years agothey must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like himand he is exactly how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian timesnotice he has scars which is probably makeupon his facebill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pita victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pithis a beautiful dog any wayand notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancyhe obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he wasthis is a great musical to watch if you like musicalsand if you dont like musicals give it a try any waytheres something for everyone in this film
