i admit not being that fond of oliver as a young childits long and the story is a little slowmoving because of all the musical numbers as a teenager i discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist think of it as a celebration of the classic story the adaptation is loose at best but really if youre watching a musical you aint there for the storybr br the music is the core of this movie and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical and it shows in their performancesand i consider this a plus the performances are all in a more stagey style of acting typical of much older films and they are very entertaining the exception is the kid playing oliver whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers waybr br fagin and the dodger are the real stars of this movie oliver reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing bill sykes even sykes dog bullseye puts on a good performancebr br this movie isnt for everyone people who hate musicals will despise it as will those who take musicals too seriously nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stagetype acting for bad acting will ruin anyones enjoyment just sit back and enjoy the entertainmentits much better if you remember that as a musical its a fantasy loosely organized around the book not a strict adaptation
