oh its so cool to watch a silent classic once in while director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for 1928 cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world for a moment she even denies her poor past the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character marion davies seesmarion davies in the studios and concludes she doesnt seem that special its got to be one of the first movieinthemovies here and for real freaks its awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a mustsee if you ask me
