as a lifelong fan of dickens i have invariably been disappointed by adaptations of his novelsbr br although his works presented an extremely accurate retelling of human life at every level in victorian britain throughout them all was a pervasive thread of humour that could be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative dictated in a way he was a literary caricaturist and cartoonist he could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence he pricked pride lampooned arrogance celebrated modesty and empathised with loneliness and poverty it may be a clich√© but he was a peoples writerbr br and it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations at the time of writing oliver twist is being dramatised in serial form on bbc television all of the misery and cruelty is their but non of the humour irony and savage lampoonery the result is just a dark dismal experience the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist its not really dickens at allbr br oliver on the other hand is much closer to the mark the mockery of officialdom is perfectly interpreted from the blustering beadle to the drunken magistrate the classic standoff between the beadle and mr brownlow in which the law is described as a ass a idiot couldnt have been better done harry secombe is an ideal choicebr br but the blinding cruelty is also there the callous indifference of the state the cold hunger poverty and loneliness are all presented just as surely as the master would have wishedbr br and then there is crime ron moody is a treasure as the sleazy jewish fence whilst oliver reid has bill sykes to perfectionbr br perhaps not surprisingly lionel bart  himself a jew from londons eastend  takes a liberty with fagin by reinterpreting him as a much more benign fellow than was dickens original in the novel he was utterly ruthless sending some of his own boys to the gallows in order to protect himself though he was also caught and hanged whereas in the movie he is presented as something of a wayward fatherfigure a sort of charitable thief rather than a corrupter of children the latter being a longstanding antisemitic sentiment otherwise very few liberties are taken with dickenss original all of the most memorable elements are included just enough menace and violence is retained to ensure narrative fidelity whilst at the same time allowing for children sensibilities nancy is still beaten to death bullseye narrowly escapes drowning and bill sykes gets a faithfully graphic comeuppancebr br every song is excellent though they do incline towards schmaltz mark lester mimes his wonderfully both his and my favourite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to who will buy its schmaltzy but its dickens through and throughbr br i could go on i could commend the wonderful setpieces the contrast of the rich and poor there is topquality acting from more british regulars than you could shake a stick atbr br i ought to give it 10 points but im feeling more like scrooge today soak it up with your christmas dinner no original has been better realised
