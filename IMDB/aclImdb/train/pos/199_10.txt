ive seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics such as nosferatu metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film it may not be the bestbut a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so goshdarn cute and wellmade marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearsts mistressbr br the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a mustsee
