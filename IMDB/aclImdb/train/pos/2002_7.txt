to a certain extent i actually liked this film better than the original vampires i found that movie to be quite misogynistic as a woman and a horror fan im used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much in this movie natasha wagner is a more fullyrealized character and the main bad guy is a gal arly jover who played a sidekick vamp in blade is very otherworldly and deadly jon bon jovi okay yeah no great actor but he does ok at least he doesnt start to sing catch it on cable if you can its on encore action this month
