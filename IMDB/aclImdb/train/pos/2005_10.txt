almost too well done john carpenters vampires was entertaining a solid piece of popcornentertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects and obviously aiming on the from dusk till dawnaudience vampires los muertos tries the same starting with a rockstar jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters but does that almost too well i havent seen jon bon jovi in any other movie so i am not able to compare his acting in vampires los muertos to his other roles but i was really suprised of his good performance after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing it my life or something but kill vampires showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done this means a lot because a part of the audience also me was probably thinking just because hes a rockstar of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest it could have been much worse and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killermachine of a vampireleader we met in part 1 or in similar way in ghosts of mars jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy moving as lithe as a cat attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin light almost transparent very erotic cloth and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made it really takes some beating but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an actionhorrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnaus nosferatu you can almost see the directors temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point the audience celebrating the funbloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure funbloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed make no mistake vampireslos muertos is a funbloodbath but its just not all the time this kind of movie just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins the barmassacre is what you expect from american popcornentertainment the seducingzoeyintheruinsscene is almost europeanlike cinema the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress but refuses answers at the same time because it would had slow down the action showed the audience a vampiress with a human past a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody and thats the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not and also is the from dusk till dawnaudience really going to like this im not sure about that nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job vampireslos muertos is surprisingly good but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative too expressive like hes keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience in my opinion wallace talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time vampires los muertos is almost too well done i give it 7 of 10
