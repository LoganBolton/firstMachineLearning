at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm strong seamless performance as derek bliss his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films the leading man no looking back but in case anyone is still wondering yes jon bon jovi can act he can act well and thats come to be expected of him its easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh1br br i generally would not watch a horror movie ive come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets so gore fans might be disappointed but story fans will notbr br unlike an action film like u571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast we get a chance to know the good guys and actually care what happens to them a few scenes are left unexplained like dereks hallucinations but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel unfortunately with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film that sequel will never happen these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing seriesbr br is this the best film ive ever seen in my life no is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained yes it wont leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it wont leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either if youre somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover this film is for you it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each otherbr br
