this is one of my alltime favorites great music and some funny bits i laugh every time at millie the maid pretending to be a d√©butante holding her dainty hankie while chatting and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats i just never can get past her french accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the bosss daughterbr br seeing a teenage mel torme and the very young frank sinatra singing is such a treat my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out she said they couldnt clear the bobbysoxers out between movies in those days you didnt have to leave between showings this movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well and victor borge gets in a bit of his routine in which is a bonus br br this is a fun movie with a sweet simple storyline very enjoyable
