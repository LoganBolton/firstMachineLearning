in frank sinatras first three films he was purely a speciality act ostensibly playing himself he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody elses movie in his fourth film the very enjoyable higher and higher young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role  a task made easier because hes playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbersbr br sinatras entrance is quite funny michele morgan hears a knock at the door and asks whos there from outside a hobokentoned voice answers frank sinatra sure enoughbr br the opening credits of higher and higher may confuse some viewers as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed in fact they only contributed one song to this musical disgustingly rich which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song im a debutante interestingly that rodgers  hart song  one of their weakest  is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movies score several others are lively uptempo numbers notably its a most important affair when it comes to love youre on your own and i saw you firstbr br sinatras good in this movie but he would do better work and sing better material elsewhere the real merits of higher and higher are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husbandwife dance team who starred in several broadway revues genuinely graceful ballroom dancers they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material here grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of pauls hands grace hartman who died of cancer at age 48 did almost no film work so its a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her closeup to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maids uniform after grace hartmans death her husband had a long career as a character actor just occasionally dancing solo or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of mayberry rfdbr br also quite attractive in a maids uniform here in higher and higher is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire why didnt this talented girl make more movies perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton i enjoy huttons performances but i like marcy mcguire even better near the end of higher and higher theres an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious regrettably although leon errol plays a large role in higher and higher he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubberlegged dance jack haley despite his prominent billing is also wastedbr br very wellrepresented here is dooley wilson inevitably remembered as sam from casablanca in that film wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of as time goes by in real life wilson couldnt play piano here in higher and higher he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players less enjoyable is mel odious i mean mel torme victor borge gives a rare film performance here handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage showsbr br the plot forget it higher and higher is nobodys idea of a great musical but its an enjoyable delight and ill rate it 8 out of 10 director tim whelan who worked in britain as well as in hollywood deserves to be much better known
