this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall its a very enjoyable lighthearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time highly recommended for its feelgood factor alone ok so frank sinatras acting leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this his first venture into hollywood his voice not his acting is his main contribution to this movie ive just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago
