higher and higher was one of rodgersharts lesser broadway musicals it only had a run of 84 performances on broadway in 1940 yet it yielded one of their bigger hits it never entered my mindbr br nevertheless except for one minor song so disgustingly rich the entire broadway score was scrapped when rko bought the film rights instead a whole new score by jimmy mchugh and harold adamson was written mostly to accommodate one francis albert sinatra who was making his feature film debutbr br sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films takes a leaf from the page of his singing rival bing crosby when bing did his feature film debut in the big broadcast he played bing crosby frank sinatra took on the role of frank sinatra and i cant think of anyone who could have done a better job br br the chairman of the board is billed third here behind stars jack haley and michele morgan hes the butler and shes the scullery maid to leon errol in fact errol is a millionaire who hasnt paid his help for seven months mainly because hes about to go belly up into chapter 11 or so he informs the staffbr br errols a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing they pool their resources and get michele morgan to impersonate errols daughter whos over in switzerland with her mother the idea being to snag a rich bankroll in the hopes rescuing the family fortune only michele starts looking at anotherbr br its a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals but rko invested this film with a good cast of players barbara hale and elizabeth risdon play another d√©butante and her mother who suspect somethings not right victor borge is a fortune seeking no account dooley wilson paul hartman grace hartman marcy mcguire mel torme and mary wickes play others of the errol household staff not a bad bunch at allbr br sinatra sang three good ballads all of them had some kind of commercial success the music stopped a lovely way to spend an evening and i couldnt sleep a wink last night the last one was nominated for an oscar for best song but lost to alice fayes youll never knowbr br 1943 was the year of the musicians union strike against the recording industry to get their material out frank sinatra recorded the songs from higher and higher with an acapella chorus for columbia bing crosby recorded songs from his film dixie in the same manner for decca both of them were denounced by the president of the union james c petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again the strike wasnt settle completely until 1944 although decca broke ranks earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than columbia rca victor and the othersbr br the strike provided some anxious moments for sinatra he had just left the tommy dorsey orchestra when the strike was called it closed off a needed venue for his artistry when he wasnt sure whether leaving dorsey would prove to be a right career move br br fortunately higher and higher was received well a legend was launched
