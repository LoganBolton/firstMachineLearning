the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexedup things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown onscreen for some weird reason did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything outright other than that this is very goodquality all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life for the shallow women out there its worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on himbr br sort of a spoiler the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book
