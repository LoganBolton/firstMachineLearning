ive never been huge on imax films theyre cool but once you get over that initial rush of whoa it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary br br the exceptions have been the powerful everest the exhilarating wild california and now the bbcs the human body a supersized look at the insides of our bodies br br our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long and still wouldnt get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted br br here you can see the inside of a pumping heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your lungs the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound the development of a baby inside a mothers womb and surprisingly a few of theum less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from pimples the churning of acids in the stomachbr br this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other imax documentaries for instance weve all seen sperm finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gayes lets get it on its creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well
