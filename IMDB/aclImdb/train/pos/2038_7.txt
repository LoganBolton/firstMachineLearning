this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasnt expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didnt take well to the lead girl and didnt really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character its not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just watch it anyway its only an hour and a half of your life youre going to live for 80 years anyway
