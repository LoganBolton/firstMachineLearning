creep is a new horror film that without a doubt will please many genre fans simply because its so down to the point and unscrupulous it has many genuine shockmoments a whole lot of repulsive goresequences and a rare claustrophobic tension what it hasnt got is logic and a solid plot but to tell you the truth that didnt bother me for one second when the endcredits start to roll there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but directorwriter christopher smith in his debut seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalinrushing action instead of long soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the creep in the london subway the story revolves on the young and haughty kate who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney whos in town to present his new film she falls asleep in the subway misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network things really get terrifying when she encounters a madraving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and killskidnaps people to experiment upon even experienced homeless people security guards or sewerworkers cant rescue her from this ravenous monster i really dug the creepcharacter hes nauseating hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints and its merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creatures origin and background i reckon this isnt very original and im sure many people wont appreciate the lack of content but i forgive smith and i think its better this way than going over the top completely jeepers creepersstyle that particular film started out great as well but as soon as the creepers identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort the obvious aspecttolove is the outrageous gore theres some severe butchering going on in this film and the makeup as well as the sound effects are very convincing the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used there also is some actingtalent present in this film with franka potenta run lola run returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film anatomie creep is terrific entertainment when youre in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director ill keep an eye on make sure you dont have to take the subway right after watching this film
