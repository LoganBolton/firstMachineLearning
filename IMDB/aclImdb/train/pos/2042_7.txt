star rating  unmissable  very good  okay  you could go out for a meal instead  avoid at all costs br br stuckup career bitch kate franka potente heads to the london underground to catch a train to take her to meet george clooney however after a hectic working day she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform as she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next however she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out therebr br in a lot of ways the british film industry is really becoming one on its own especially in the horror thriller department with films such as creep and the successful 28 days later which this has strong echoes of in parts in terms of succeeding in what it set out to do creep does cleverly create especially at the beginning a scary sense of isolation and tense fear at its clever running time it also though inadvertently i suspect manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer highconcept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear throughout without really focusing too much on character development and suchbr br of its weaknesses some scenes are a little predictable but these dont really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way im not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and its not exactly perfect but its certainly very effective and serves its basic function very well
