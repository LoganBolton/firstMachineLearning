i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section to tell you the truth the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didnt have a choice d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs but it turned out to be semigore flick somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable and that is absolutely correct i really couldnt care less if potentes character got her entrails ripped out by the creep i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potentes character getting her just desserts christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film however the story is rather weak but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch that more than anything else really scared the crap out of mebr br the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the qa session i really do hope he gets to make better films in the futurebr br this one is strictly for genre fans but id recommend nonfans to give this a try anyway it was a fun ride
