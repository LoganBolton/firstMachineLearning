a brutally depressing script and some fine lowkey performances by peter strauss and pamela reed and some good location shooting in ohio power this fine tv movie about hard times in the rustbelt as the mills close and the union jobs disappear the bluecollar workers are threatened by everyone management owners their wives and children strauss is completely believable in his role and pamela reed is as always wonderful see if you can recognize john goodman before he put on weightbr br the heavy metal score  was someone making a pun  is at times obtrusively annoying but the cinematography by frank stanley is knockout particularly the mill scenes
