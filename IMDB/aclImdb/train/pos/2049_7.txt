this movie is pretty cheesy but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for its principles there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as wellbr br the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the moviebr br i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran sure its not all that well done but the premise is not at all badbr br tom
