ah mcbain the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by the simpsons but it will also always  to me personally at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90s action flick directed by the cool dude who brought us the exterminator and starring two of the most ultimately badass bmovie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside the latter with a cute little macho ponytail i guess mcbain will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure because theres no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture the film is unimaginably preposterous most action heroes take on a small gangster posse  mcbain takes on an entire country and yet takes itself way too seriously the script is a nonstop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations nonsensical twists compulsory sentimental interludes grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings its a totally delirious movie i loved it br br vietnam pow mcbains life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos debt eighteen years later santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and hes publicly executed on el presidentes balcony his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower mcbain and his former vietnam buddies who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoopass br br okay lets not fool each other here the fact youre reading a user comment on mcbain already indicates that you have some sort of interest for lowbudget bmovie action one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of mcbain this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it heck i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list like the preposterous and needless heroic self sacrifice of a soldier who doesnt even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbains squad but whats the point you definitely know not to expect a 100 coherent and plausible masterpiece we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie and its maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel please dont expect another apocalypse now this particular motion picture relies on the ruff n tuff acting performances of the macho leads a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of brothers in arms
