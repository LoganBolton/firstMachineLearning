when i first heard about the title i thought of the simpsons just like so many other reviewers but when i saw the cast i was completely stunned that so many great characteractors would actually be in this first of all we have christopher walken deer hunter pulp fiction who plays the title character mcbain he is rescued from a vietnam powcamp by some of his buddies one of which is santos chick vennera yanks who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently and tells him that he can redo the favor to him if he ever gets into troublebr br then 18 years later santos and his sister christina maria conchita alonso the running man predator 2 join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator el presidente victor argo taxi driver king of new york and when santos fails the mission christina goes to mcbain for helpbr br mcbain then asks his good ol vietnam buddies to help him first theres the token tough black guy eastland played by american ninjas steve james who was also in director james glickenhaus previous movie the exterminator where the exterminators real name also was eastland coincidence i think not there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator among other things the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a weldersmask when christina sees him for the first time when he is working on a weldingjob on top of a bridge br br the other guys in the vietnampack are the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team frank bruce michael ironside total recall starship troopers and then theres the doc dalton played by jay patterson who doesnt look like the guy the imdb is linking to and i havent seen him in other movies so who knows and last but not least theres the cop gill who has had enough of his unsatisfying job hes played by thomas g waites who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thingbr br and in other big roles we find luis guzm√°n boogie nights carlitos way as a smalltime drugdealer who cant get a decent job also there is dick boccelli as the drugdealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbaingang almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meatgrinder by john eastland in the exterminatormovie now i havent seen glickenhaus shakedownblue jean cop yet but im almost ready to bet half a hundreddollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too br br well back to the plot of this movie they go off to colombia and saves the day yay but who cares about the plot anyway the cast is great and the actionscenes are very well done and youre never bored while watching this movie highly recommended to all actionlovers
