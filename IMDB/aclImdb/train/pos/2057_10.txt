there wasnt a day in 2002 where i wasnt chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue wellbr br it brought back a lot of memories as it was so realisticbr br even today i have nightmares about corn on the cob and cant even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my lifebr br i have to admit though at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to homebr br for those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims br br this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn believe me ive been there and i have the scars br br watch the film its amazing and educational
