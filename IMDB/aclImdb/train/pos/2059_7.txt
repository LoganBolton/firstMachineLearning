what a fun bmovie shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80s the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesnt matter because it never once takes itself seriously from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow this is truly a bmovie gem grab some refreshments snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films sure theyre not for everybody but to each his own sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile
