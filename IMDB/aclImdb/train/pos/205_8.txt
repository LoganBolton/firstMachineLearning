first an explanation despite my headline im giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made all the criticisms registered here have valid points also be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simons brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue  especially dry jewish lovesuffused sarcasm  and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this moviebr br so much for warnings heres my main point walter matthau is flatout perfect even beyond perfect in this movie i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter  because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star selfimage or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch and he only barely shows us that sad part  its just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own fathers or husbands mental decline right now i mention this as a warning but artistically its just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots im seen in possibly any film performance this is beyond method acting  matthaus performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery this is a masterpiece of comic actingbr br about richard benjamin i personally find his acting annoying in general and his work in this movie is no exception  although he has some fine moments here chicken is funny is one of them so if you like him you should like him here and if you dont this movie wont change your mindbr br about the 1976 oscarsi agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in cuckoos nest that year it was a killer year for leadingactor competition if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for dog day afternoon and to walter matthau for the sunshine boys  not to dis jacks fine work as mcmurphy but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance  i mean he was good in this movie but not that good burnss fineasever but unexceptionalinitself return to show biz beat brad dourifs truly brilliant debut in cuckoos nest not to mention chris sarandons stunning debut in dog day afternoon  which i think proves my theory br br oscar theories aside heres my bottom line review if you like matthaus comic acting then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmotherinspired gestures fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides but if youre currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now
