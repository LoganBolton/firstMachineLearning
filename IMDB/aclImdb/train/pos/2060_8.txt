this movie is not your typical horror movie it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical i personally liked the movie because of its offbeat humor its definetely not a super scary movie which is good if you dont want to be scared and paranoid afterwards i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester very believable i think im going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow very cool anyway overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience
