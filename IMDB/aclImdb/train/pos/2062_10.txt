first off ill be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit overthetop a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow wouldve made this movie much less cheesy but overall i think its one of the better bmovies tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful not to mention incredibly beautiful though this movie is missing the allimportant nude factor there are several other movies at which to view her but here she gets all evilhotness especially towards the end as shes walking away from the engulfed scarecrow also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend yes its a low budget bmovie but out of all of them ive seen this is definitely one of my very top favorites
