its easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the xfiles wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens werent all little grey men or mindcontrol goop but could actually surprise youbr br fearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant  actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk  and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and its very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy  yeah we get it zoos are bad except when theyre not  but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked  why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested inbr br in the end it wasnt an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly its something that you couldnt imagine many other shows doing
