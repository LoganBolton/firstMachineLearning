martin sheen michelle phillips stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brothers death mr sheen mr margolin and mr morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles ms phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a madefortv movie twentyfive years ago by supplying the sex interest in an otherwise sexless film the real star however is the california kid a 1934 ford coupe borrowed from jake jacobs put before a camera and given a workout thatll leave the viewer panting gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipationbr br the action scenes are spectacular although some of the dialog is a bit lame making for a fine evenings diversion this is how all car movies should be madebr br try to catch this one on the late movie channel its well worth the missed sleep
