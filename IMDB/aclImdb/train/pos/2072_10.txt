i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television it is far superior in action than most movies since martin sheen is excellent and though nick nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support vic morrow as the villain is superbbr br when sheen tests the water in his 34 ford cool along the mountainous highway it is spectacularbr br the ending is grandbr br im disappointed in the low vote this received i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these daysbr br good taste eludes the masses
