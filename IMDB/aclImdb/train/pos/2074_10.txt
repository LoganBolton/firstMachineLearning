another channel 4 great canned long before its time compelling acting from phil davis and the rest of the cast sexy intelligent and funny i remember watching it at the time and even then asking around noone had really heard of it but trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder perhaps channel 4 dont do their job well enough in drumming up the enthusiasm needed either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother i suspect the latter downloading of garth merengies dark place prompted channel 4 to release a dvd of that series lets hope the same can happen with north square
