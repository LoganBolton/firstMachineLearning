1st watched 8292009  7 out of 10 dirsidney franklin well told account of farmers in china and their rise to prominence and struggles with what mother nature throws at them this movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the sons arranged marriage to a slave girl the movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by paul muni it chronicles  wong longthe character played by muni and how he works the land buys more land eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started the relationship between him and his wife played by luise rainer is the main thread of the storybesides the land itself and despite the obvious nonchinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and its people its obvious that mgm used its money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it the scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and its pulled off pretty well
