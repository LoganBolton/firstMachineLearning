the good earth is a great movie that you dont hear much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a nonpassionate love story all of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by todays standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time periodbr br i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role she basically only has three emotions submissive hungry and heartbrokenbr br the performances by the asian and asianamerican actors are terrificbr br
