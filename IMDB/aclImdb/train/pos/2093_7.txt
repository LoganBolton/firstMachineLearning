this is a bit long 2 hours 20 minutes but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to coverbr br it was soapoperish at times but had some visually dramatic moments too capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film that was astounding to view considering this film is about 70 years old the specialeffects crew on this film did a spectacular jobbr br paul muni and luise rainer were awardwinning actors in their day and they dont disappoint here both giving powerful performances the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them like walter connolly just dont look real id like to see a remake of this movie with allasian actors not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible
