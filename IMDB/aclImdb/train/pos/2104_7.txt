who doesnt know largo winch in the francebelgiumluxemburg trio the three countries where the french bd or bandes dessin√©es are massively published  18 years after the publication of the first comic book which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels it had to be adapted on screens after a first  and failed attempt with a tv show the real thing beginsbr br first of all and thats what most of the fans didnt get the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series some essential parts characters and actions of the original are missing the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series as a 1st classfan of the comic book i must confess i was nicely surprised the actors are good so is the scenario though it might seem too fast i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financialpolitical thrillers but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet
