the shop around the corner is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan its filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart theyre the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs in fact the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesnt make anymore the makers of youve got mail claim their film to be a remake but thats just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise anyway if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940s youll find the shop around the corner to be nothing short of wonderful just as good with repeat viewings enjoy
