much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30odd years later its hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrotebr br walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73yearold solo act who cant get a job in a potato chip commercial his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis george burns for an abctv celebration of show business nostalgiabr br nostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in spades right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porters be a clown then theres the films presentday setting in manhattan where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound the periods collide in willys glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of longdead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartmentbr br willy clearly has been living there too long hes sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils willy wakes up and picks up the phonebr br hello who is this a pause never mind its the teabr br old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone elses hands but simons deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willys almost existential condition without turning you off at all 89 years old and just like that he dies of nothing willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with babybr br burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but its matthau who brings this one home his makeup and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving bens description crazy freakin old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others patience his lines kill you too especially when hes trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad ideabr br youre out of touch willy tells lewis at one point im still in demand im still hotbr br if this room was on fire you wouldnt be hot lewis repliesbr br director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and midrange shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the films overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and rosss direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that endbr br comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
