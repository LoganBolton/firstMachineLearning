everyone in the cast from sugiyama to aoki and toyoko is someone we know in everyday life they were so natural and sugiyamas transformation is incredibly believable the score is so moving it brought me to tears the choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic mais graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character you can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing the king and i aokis character is both hilarious and pitiful masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all rightbr br this film is truly a keeper
