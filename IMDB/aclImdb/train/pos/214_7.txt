an old vaudeville team of willy clark walter matthau and al lewis george burns were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv specialbut find out they still hate each other willys nephewagent richard benjamin tries to get them to work togetherbr br a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor i somewhat liked it it was written by neil simon so its nonstop oneliners some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and als senility was not also i never liked matthau i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly all that aside this was fun burns is just great tossing off oneliners with ease and even matthau was good matching him their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie also benjamin is very good as willys nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other for me its worth seeing for burns alone this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god so this is good just goodnot great matthaus character really makes this hard to love i give it a 7
