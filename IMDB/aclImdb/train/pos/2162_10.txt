i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated i understand why some of you dislike this movie its pace is slow a characteristic of japanese films nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not a problem at allbr br i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen shall we dansu is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies it is very different from hollywood ones eg austin powers or scary movies in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes rather it is lighthearted a movie that makes you feel goodbr br i love the movie because it makes me feel real the plot is straightforward yet pleasing i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork i felt lost however this film made me think of the bright side of life i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama if he could find himself in his hobby why couldnt i it reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily lifebr br it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes onbr br over all this film is encouraging and heartwarming as a comedy it does its job perfectly it definitely deserves 10 starsbr br and yes aoki is funny d
