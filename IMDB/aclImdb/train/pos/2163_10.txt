i simply love this movie it is a perfect example of the wellrounded surprising stories that come out of asian cinema there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez please do not confuse the two movies the original japanese film is touching subtle and wonderfully acted the hollywood version is the exact opposite i was aghast when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version and who was starring in it its typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at its worst the remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon the only reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the us audiences aversion to subtitlesbr br one of the main reasons this movie would never work in an american telling is that the reserved ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance but half of the movies tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in japanbr br please try to see this movie in its original form not the terrible full screen and please do skip the us remakeits a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese moviebr br yes i know the original movie is much older and this is simply a japanese take on the story but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remakebr br speaking of foreign films ill make a few quick recommendations 1monsoon weddingi list this first for a reason outstanding film 2johnny stechinovery funny italian mistaken identity flic 3shiria korean action pic that mixes both asian flare  us style plot 4run lola runa german film that integrates its techno score ingeniouslybr br well just a quick list anyway
