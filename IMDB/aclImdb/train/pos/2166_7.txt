im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this filmit was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgyi dont know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thrilleri saw this at about 200am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch itif you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that badthe characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more betteri dont know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to videoi for one would buy this if its on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the xfiles story attached to itgovernment undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealingsoverall a good film
