ok first of all ignore the last person review they admit to falling asleep through it so its no wonder they didnt understand what was going on as thrillerhorrors go this film aint too bad it is certainly very watchable right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clearbr br i enjoyed this movie it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable great to watch late at night i give it a generous 7 out of 10
