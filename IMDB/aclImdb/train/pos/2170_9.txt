i think that that creators of this films concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received it isnt an oscar caliber film of course but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 in the theatre br br i dont think this is and hope it isnt a spoiler but imagine acting on your impulses doing the first thought that pops into your head saying the first words on your lips no restraint no conscious nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that as intelligent adults we know we shouldnt actually say or do if anything this film only scratches the surface  it doesnt go as far as it could go br br in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older classics to try and cash in on today wouldnt it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level a bit further or even to explore what the original crew didnt wouldnt or couldnt deal with 20 years ago br br thats just my opinion anyway o
