we saw the silent version of this film and it is quite simply shimmeringly beautiful its quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created since it is shot with pure silent technique long wordless sweeps of narrative without a single intertitle  save for a few disconcerting sequences where louise brooks playing a french typist is quite visibly speaking in english the only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene where brooks is watching the rushes for her test for a sound film footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds with her mouth moving in ceaseless soundless song i was unsurprised to learn afterwards that this passage alone in the talkie version had been hailed as an exemplar of new technique br br in the sunny beauty of its opening scenes and the fairytale inevitability of what follows the film resembles a dream as a louise brooks movie it was not at all what i was expecting either from her hollywood comedies or from gwpabsts german melodramas i found the idiom more fluent and enjoyable than either and brooks herself is a different creature a sturdy laughing young animal rather than a shopwindow vamp or manipulated dollbr br but what gives this film greater depth than at first appears is the unexpected second half repelled by the rich parasites who cluster around her beauty the pauper princess returns to a tearstained reunion with her humblyborn true love and the tale might very well have been ended there fairytale however turns to tragedy the dilettante grabovsky confident in his ability to manipulate the woman he desires is yet all too correct in his selfinterested prediction  the young lovers cannot make each other happy  and andré ironically was right to mistrust the social influence of beauty contests after the intoxication of her moments glory lucienne frets herself to despair over the humdrum routine of married life while her husband in turn is driven wild by any reminder of the whole affair if it were a simple case of a mismatched marriage that would be one thing but the true tragedy is that they do love each otherbr br in many ways prix de beauté reminds me of murnaus sunrise but if so the fairground and photographer scenes here would form a distorted mirrorimage of the joyous reconciliation in sunrise no dream but an alienating nightmare and the following dawn brings not a miraculous reunion but an empty bed and deserted home leaving a letter to say that she loves him and will always love him lucienne vanishes again from andrés life in quest of brightness and freedom and this time she will never come backbr br gossip columns confirm all andrés worst convictions as he learns of his wifes whereabouts through reports coupling her name with grabovsky when the young workman penetrates at last to the lavish sanctum of the screeningroom it is with drawn gun  to be greeted by the sight of his rival courting and caressing a laughing lucienne the same woman who had pledged her undying affection as she left him he kills her but even as he kills is transfixed by the living image on screen lucienne in all her transformed glory as he never saw her the two women are juxtaposed in an endless powerful moment as andré is seen seized unresisting and pulled away the dying girl and her singing self still projected above caught unknowing out of time into celluloid eternity playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath herbr br the main jarring element in the film is the character of andrés coworker antonin who appears to serve no role throughout other than to be the licensed butt of his contemporaries malice he is the ugly one who can never get the girl the ungainly wimp who is tripped and tormented in the washrooms and at work and must take it all with an uncertain ingratiating smile in his fruitless hope for social acceptance a typical product of the bullying of the more gifted and popular in other words but one the audience is apparently being invited to laugh at along with his tormentors unless the intention is to expose a darker side to the protagonists for which i perceive no sign the character seems to exist merely as comic relief but comic relief with a distinctly nasty edge when we know him only as an inept peeping tom at the waterside its easy to laugh although the others revenge seems a little over the top when we discover that he is no chancemet stranger but andrés colleague and regular sidekick the continuing attacks rapidly cease to be very funnybr br but it is the images that remain beauty nightmare and dream
