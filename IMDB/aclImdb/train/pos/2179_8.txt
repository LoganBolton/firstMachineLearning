prix de beauté was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound which came a little later in europe than in hollywood originally conceived as a silent it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in france with a french actress speaking louise brooks lines but was released as a silent in italy and other parts of europe i was lucky enough to see the cineteca di bolognas flawless new restoration of an italian silent print at the tribeca film festival i havent seen the talkie version yet but i think its safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done louise brooks is clearly speaking english so theres no way her lips could be matched also the film is made entirely in the silent style with few titles and little need for dialogue prix de beauté tells its story visually with exciting imaginative camerawork the opening is instantly kinetic with rapidlycut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail on clothing machinery decoration and symbolic images such as a caged bird a heap of torn photographs a diamond bracelet this is silent film technique at its pinnaclebr br louise brooks of course is responsible for saving the film from obscurity seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role lustrously beautiful she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance her role here more than in the pabst films for which shes best known is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with she plays lucienne garnier a typist with a possessive fiancé who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest with immediate success she is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him all of the characters are drawn with nuance the fiancé inspires pity and is not merely a brute he loves lucienne but is a limited man who cant cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men even the other man in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fiancésbr br warning spoilers below br br the film has many fine set pieces including luciennes triumph in the miss europe contest shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers her misery as a housewife peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her a nightmarish trip to a funfair in the silent version this occurs late in the film after her marriage at which lucienne crushed among the lowlifes and depressed by her husbands macho antics decides that she cant go on with her present existence and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test louise brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here with the projectors beam flickering on her alabaster profile her shoulders swathed in white fur her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen the double shot of her exquisite corpse and her stillliving image on the screen is particularly poignant louise brooks image like luciennes remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career
