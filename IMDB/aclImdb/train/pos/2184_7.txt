while a pleasant enough musical what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone as the hasbeen composer and oscar levant as his assistant playing a high strung distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical sherlock holmes rathbones character looks like he couldnt find his way out of bed without help and that help is starbuck played with his usual droll humor by oscar levant upon hiring crosbys character as his ghost song writer rathbone introduces him to starbuck by saying he does all my thinking for me to which levant responds ah its only a parttime job of course this goes right past or over rathbone whos too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from as another reviewer said who knew rathbone could be so funny too bad he didnt have more opportunities to display his comedic talent
