poor basil rathbone an egotistical composer whos lost his muse hes been faking it for some time buying his lyrics and his music from various sources trouble is that two of the sources bing crosby music and mary martin words happen to meet and fall in love and then they discover what theyve been doing complications ensue but all is righted at the endbr br crosby and martin sing terrifically mary had signed a paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on crosbys kraft music hall radio show for reasons i dont understand movie audiences didnt take to her so she went back to broadway and did one touch of venus in 1944 and stayed therebr br basil rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well his ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick oscar levant and again im surprised they didnt do more films togetherbr br as in most of crosbys paramount vehicles no big production numbers but i agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop good job by allbr br a surprisingly original plot and great entertainment
