the third fred macmurraycarole lombard film is a bit more serious than hands across the table and the princess comes across its yet another adaption of the play burlesque which apparently was popular back in the daybr br the original play burlesque ran on broadway in the 19271928 season for 372 performances and its the role that carole lombard plays that barbara stanwyck originated on broadway that brought her to hollywood a version starred nancy carroll in the early days of talkies and later on betty grable and dan dailey did still another version of it in when my baby smiles at mebr br in fact i have a vinyl album of a radio version that al jolson and ruby keeler did for the lux radio theater thats an interesting work believe mebr br anyway macmurray and lombard do fine by the old chestnut the story is now set in a nightclub where lombard is a singer and macmurray is a jazz trumpeter note a nice performance by dorothy lamour as the latin vixen who gets between fred and carole also anthony quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for lombardbr br swing high swing low holds up real nice today and i wouldnt be surprised if we see yet another version of burlesque for the twenty first century
