ive just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film  television archive smore entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdbbr br mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if youre in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head youll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and wellexecutedand even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it
