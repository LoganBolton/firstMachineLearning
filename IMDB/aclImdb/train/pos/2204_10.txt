i think that the movie was kind of weird in the opening scene a person is killed for no reason he doesnt get mentioned again the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie it isnt the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie i give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale
