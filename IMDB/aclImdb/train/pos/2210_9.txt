i cant believe how many people hate hal sparks he was my favorite host of the show hands down i hate celebrity gossip and generally dislike talk shows but when hal sparks hosted talk soup it was must see tv for me i rarely missed an episode during his run and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in although most of the guests still did a fine job br br anyway for all the people who dislike hal sparks i imagine they must have never seen the weekend specials they were hour long episodes of talk soup that comprised the best clips from the entire week and were padded out by sketch comedy bits the original bits that hal sparks did were hilarious in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon and in an exorcist like scene his head spun as he told dated jokes about airline food one episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity as a bunch of cloned hal sparks kept multiplying through out the episode overrunning the studiobr br ok maybe these dont sound as funny when i describe them but all i know is that besides talk soup the only other two shows i watched consistently during those years was the simpsons and late night with conan obrian so if you like the comedy stylings of those shows then youd probably like talk soup during the sparks yearsbr br that said henson and tyler were both great hosts as well all three hosts brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedians in my opinion of course throughout the tyler and guest star years my interest in this show began to wane but every now and then i catch the soup the shows spiritual successor and sure enough the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to timebr br ok ive wasted enough time talking about a tv show that isnt on the air anymore and on a channel that i generally despise go watch something else
