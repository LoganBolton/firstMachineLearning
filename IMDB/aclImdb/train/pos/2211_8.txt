i dont watch a lot of tv except for the office weeds entourage and es soup i think i hold this show in good companybr br i love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a sanjaya or heidi montag spbr br the best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments cmon most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the auditions which is why most people claim to watch and that means i dont have to suffer through the other 98 of these mind numbing talk shows or reality shows for one nugget of funny or shock the only reason why soup doesnt get a 10 in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny and on an even rarer occasion the commentary isnt always up to par but they cant all be home runs either if so soup wouldnt be on ebr br joels quick wit and soups writing team which includes mchale make for a great show i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are offcamera even when theyre being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs its hilarious because it is forced theyre obviously being ironic and thats part of what makes this show funny
