my family goes back to new orleans late 1600s early 1700s and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grandparents never talked about but we knew it existed i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can pass as white and chose not to its a hard history to watch when you realize that its your family theyre talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the arse of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existenceand at the same time had i not come out of that history i probably wouldnt be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor but it is a movie that needed to be made anne rice is incredible and i ask myself why is she symbolically writing about my family and im not i recommend this movie to everyone leza
