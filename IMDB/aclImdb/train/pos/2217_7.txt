i am normally skeptical about watching films or miniseries based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel fortunately i was wrong the screenplay was very close to the novel i guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer huhbr br the cast is outstanding i cant describe how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors from ossie davis and ruby dee to robert richard and bianca lawsonbr br the location setting i was expecting to see the homes and cottages i imagined in my mind what i saw on screen was slightly different however it wasnt enough to make me dislike the miniseriesbr br i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel you will not be disappointed if you have 8 out of 10 starsbr br
