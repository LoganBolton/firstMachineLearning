i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out i didnt really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loudbr br with all due respect to george burns rip walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film his performance is amazinggiven the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark his mannerisms are firstrate you know what kind of songs he wrote sht and when speaking to the spanishspeaking guy at the front desk no no no enchilada absolutely hilariousbr br kudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthaubr br i just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit oldbr br i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original
