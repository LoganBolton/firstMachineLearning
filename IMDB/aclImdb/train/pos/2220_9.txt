we tend to forget that the masterslave context of the past centuries lead to more than welltended estates powered by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for the white owners it lead to a group of people caught in the middle  the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slavesbr br some of these children just became more slaves and others were freebut free and coloured which back then meant anything but relative to the lot of their siresbr br a class formed around these offspring  the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour  and that class was able to a certain extent to own property raise themselves from downtrodden to educated and to attain a comparative dignity that is to say they werent slaves but they were still exploited to a certain extentbr br often the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth set up in their own houses with allowances schooling paid for for their children and a kind of gentility dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families in essence they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from labour  an arrangement called pla√ßagebr br feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman and the people who touched on their lives in both a negative and a positive way the tale was an eyeopener for me a new zealander with no real conception of the blackwhite lines let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerlybr br the characters are very three dimensional and have been wellrendered in this adaption of the novel by anne rice the parts are wellcast the costumes are wonderful and the brutal way the lines are drawn out with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through the gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites the slaves could not help themselves and the whites even the sympathetic ones couldnt bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended onbr br i recommend this story both the novel and the miniseries to everyone unreservedly if you cant handle the truth youll cringe and cower through some parts as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour both by their white oppressors and by their own people bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about itbr br i know it may sound callous but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on and i thoroughly enjoyed it watch it if not read up on the period because theres a lesson to be learned from it all
