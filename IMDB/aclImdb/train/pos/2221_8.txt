one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravoinitially out of curiosity i decided to watch itto be perfectly honest i wasnt disappointedthe main character is beautiful and her body is shown off wellyou would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole filmmy only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnikchrist its badthe prison guard hank is woeful tooall he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his coguard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions this movie is well watching alone for the beautifultalented and very sexy jennifer thomas
