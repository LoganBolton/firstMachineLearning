i am surprised at imdbs low rating of this movie with all due respect its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills a bigger budget and more gorebr br the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film it is not nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one it is a psychological thriller it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie reelcoms review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie all the other negative reviews doesnt make much sense its almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change very rare these days is something bad and not worth itbr br i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didnt make sense martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing we sympathize with this coldblooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the films direction and writingbr br i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6s range on originality alone i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale aka smart people since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddys nightmarebr br kudos to the acting as well for such a low budget film you are amazed that this movie didnt hit your local cinema with the great direction writing and acting please dont be fooled by the rating by imdb this movie is worth it i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice
