this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesnt comfortably fit any mold its horror but not a splatterfest its equal part suspense as well as horror yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera br br the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the charactersbr br forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe thats a red herring he is acting here camp is a misreading of the tone of this story adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance so she must believe the script has something to say we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly dont care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap cut and get their paychecks this is not the case herebr br forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondofunny regularity i dont think the intent was humorous but to keep you off balance br br think of it less of a horror movie and more of a horror play on a stage that decrepit whitewashed house then you might see its really about paranoia fear and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace usabr br and it is twisty time travel mind control secret experiments and nazis who may not be dead  yetbr br i say rent it and give it a try if youre in the mood for something a little cerebral this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down
