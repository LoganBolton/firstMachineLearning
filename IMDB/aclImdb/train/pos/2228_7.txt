the main problem i see with this film is its score which screams with every note this is a cheapass movie theres not much more to say here the score just plain suckedbr br the second problem which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film one of the the money shots if you will is the dialogue between martha adrienne barbeau and the sunflower man richard ziman in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment at all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that she is listening to a movie dialogue in other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willynilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audiencebr br the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch the main point of her performance that didnt seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambolike woman on a mission this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon barbeau to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a wholebr br finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the moviebr br so whats my holistic grading of this piece id give it a solid c to b depending upon how much credit youre inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism i see no problems with plot development or coherence the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit fizzly in the second half and nicholas brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performancebr br all in all this film is definitely worth the viewsee it with a nazi you love
