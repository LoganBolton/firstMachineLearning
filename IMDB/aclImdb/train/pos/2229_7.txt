ive read some terrible things about this film so i was prepared for the worst confusing muddled horribly structured while there may be merit to some of these accusations this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer in fact it actually had aspirations it attempted something beyond the typical monsterslasher nonsense and by god there are some interesting things going onbr br ms barbeau is a miracle to behold she carries the film squarely on her shouldersbr br this is not to say that its a masterpiece unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition there are just too many unexplained subplots trying to coexist and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed for example if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother then why doesnt she just kill ma in the films very first sequence seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do itbr br still i give unholy points for trying a little ambition is not a bad thing
