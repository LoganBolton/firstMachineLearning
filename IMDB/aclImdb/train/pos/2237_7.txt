it was considered to be the swiss answer to the lord of the rings but it is much more than that it isnt an answer to anything its in itself something new something funny and sometimes its downright stupid and silly  but was monty python any different than sillybr br the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated but to compensate the missing special effects the landscape does the trick it is absolutely beautiful and stunning  who needs new zealand switzerland has it all br br what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it it isnt brilliant yet its got some good humorous parts edward piccin as friedo is absolutely convincing it would be enough to go and see the film because of himthere are some good jokes some of them are very lame some of them wont be understood by people outside of switzerland i liked the idea of having urucows instead of uruk hai i loved the scene where friedo decides to take pupsi a telehobbie with him on the journey also very funny is the scene when rackaroll the swordfighting knight decides to show off with his sword  and subsequently smashes it into a wall breaking it and there is this one scene where the nazgulish characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush i didnt approve of the idea of the ring being used by schleimli the gollum character in order to seduce the ladies that was a bit far fetched the idea of lord sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasnt that brilliant either original certainly but not brilliant but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon that really wasnt necessary all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy dont expect a lotr parody like spaceballs was for star wars but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out with absolutely no ambitions then youll enjoy i am not sure if it works in other languages because it does live from the swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actorsbr br all in all hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that
