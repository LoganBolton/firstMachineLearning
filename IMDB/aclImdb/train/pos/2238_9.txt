as this movie is completely in swiss dialect its probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie im not from switzerland but i worked there for some years so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings ive seen a lot of movies of this kind eg scary movie loads of scifi spoofs etc but this one is the best one of that kind ive seen so far i give a 9 of 10 the only reason i cant give a 10 is because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd so theres almost no chance for nonswiss to understand
