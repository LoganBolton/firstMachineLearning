partially from the perceived need one feels to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950s moviegoing public br br the film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upperclass bureaucrats running the foreign office  the british are pilloried in the way that only the british can pillory themselves but after that the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot terrythomas watchable as always but the great talent in the cast peter sellers et al is largely wastedbr br a diverting but not great film
