i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it the actors were on top of their characters backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great the music was lush and wellthoughtout it even had a decent twist of an ending so whats with everyone voting it down the story wasnt entirely fresh felt like a remnant of running man with the whole television show idea but the attitude towards christianity and judaism about how the public picks their messiah certainly sounded true enough it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunitybr br its possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word god in it but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by somebr br i gave it a 710 stars here on imdb i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original for the mostpart check it out if youre not too offended to see an entertaining film from madrid spain about possibilities of the coming modern messiah to a tv near you
