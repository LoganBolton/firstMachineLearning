a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema i never thought jordi molla could be such a great director after all i really dont care much for his choice in movies however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something i always enjoy it hasnt enjoyed much good press and i really dont think itll ever be released in the us market well have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that i dont want to say much about the story because i dont want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it like sooooooooooo many before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on
