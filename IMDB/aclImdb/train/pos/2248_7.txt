a surprising rent at a local video store i was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge oliver stones natural born killers and almost as disturbing i think it went well with my viewing to be in late 2004 watching the republican machine do its magic on the majority of americas television viewing populous it brings up the question are we really that manipulative br br it definitely skewed my view there was also a larger theological question being provoked the story of christ could word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitive as television produce a messiah could the story of christ been exaggerated could it have been completely fabricated its something the movie puts in a extremely perceptive light
