i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store it was in almost mint condition and id never heard of it before clearly nobody else had eitherbr br i cant believe my luck you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message  the very moral and nontriumphalist stance of the mandela party undoubtedly despite its enormous length i had to watch it in two sittings  it was like a book one couldnt put down perhaps the songs are not all that memorable but the spirit of the thing glows on forever i cannot understand comments that a musical clearly designed for stage is not realistic ive seen south pacific and read the book too and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book ill treasure this little find until it wears out one day theyll make this again on a better budgetbr br
