this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise whos a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles youll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheauxs films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shamebr br adding further info popular blues singer of the 20s and 30s cora green is the focus of the film shes mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hotcha entertainer in the 30s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing theres even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold movebr br this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessbr br no these early race films may not be the best cant be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black filmmaking and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race filmmakers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some werent great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think youll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films arent the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
