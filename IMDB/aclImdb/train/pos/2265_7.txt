i am a huge fan of vonneguts work and im very fond of this movie but i wouldnt say that this is a film of the mother night that i read when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of bluebeard now in production amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonneguts sirens of titan would probably have been the equivalent of r rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s for its violence language and sexual and thematic content though its a tragedy that nobodys come up yet with a filmable script for it and in the present economic climate i also hope some director out there is looking closely at jailbird galapagos and hocus pocusbr br the other thing is his narrative style heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny it seems impossible to objectify and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like talkovers vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as authornarrator to its credit breakfast of champions the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel slapstick in an even more spectacular waybr br still theres nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut and mother night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this but so much of the humour is lost that though its the same plot its not really from the same novel i read if it had been id probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it for a reader of the novel i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable the end of the film however is truly poignant and i think one of the films successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that youve watched someone walk a razors edge between good and evil and the jury is still outbr br standing alone and of itself its well worth a look technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness the acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by todays standards a little stiltedbr br it survives quite well watching back to back with slaughterhouse5 and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed vonnegut out there mostly versions of his short stories  harrison bergeron who am i this time and some other things like of course the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play happy birthday wanda june also there was an interesting piece  if it still exists done in the 70s called between time and timbuktu which vonnegut apparently didnt like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale the island of dr moreau but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his workbr br but if the films dont make you want to go to the superior source material theyre not doing their jobbr br as the man said more or less the big show is inside your head
