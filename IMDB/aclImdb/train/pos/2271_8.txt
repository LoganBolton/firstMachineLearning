ive just finished listening to the directors commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like manns the insider is completely subjective its from howards pov so any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it as ebert did is really about noltes character actually if you feel as he did that the film does not work then youre saying i think that howard does not work and to be frank you might be right howards reasoning and personality really wouldnt stand up to professional mental treatments and analysisbr br but hey thats the nature of peoplebr br andrew
