although i like kurt vonnegut im not particularly interested in spy stories and i didnt know this one the only reason i watched it was nick nolte who is one of my favorite actors since i saw breakfast of champions and hotel rwanda but the film brought me a pleasant surprise of course nolte was great but so was the plot there was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question by reading his antisemitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans and as it later turns out americans towards jews or hitler which carries more weight his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to antisemitism the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken not even as narration howard campbell jr nolte is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesnt open up not even in his memoirs the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray  but with the help of excellent acting and photography this film manages br br there are other points to it such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clich√©s like the song white christmas that make it real different from average american movies i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies
