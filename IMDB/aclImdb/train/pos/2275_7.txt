american playwright howard w campbell jr played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte lives happily in germany with his actress wife helga noth sheryl lee before the beginning of world war ii at the peak of his life howard is drafted by an american agent john goodman to become a spy on behalf of the allies forewarned of the risks the job holds howard has everything to lose but finds the offer irresistible following the death of his wife and the end of the war campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city which muddies his neuroses even further the central question indeed a question that has frustrated many critics of the movie and kurt vonneguts source novel is is campbell a hero or a traitor director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b weide offer us clues but no answer and this ambiguitythis not knowingis what keeps mother night fresh and interesting throughout at the beginning of the film nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident by the end hes either scared and uncertain or scared and completely certain of his contributiondebt to humanity for the role he played in the war gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the films first half which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonneguts dramatic side on the flip side when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment which he affectionately calls purgatory only to be discovered by a group of nazis the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds the moral even spiritual paradox mother night presents doesnt lend itself to simple resolution and to a degree should be left ambiguousthe blackandwhite scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about the war changes him coming back to america changes him and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his act even further to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall spewing antisemitic bile perhaps thats the best reaction we could hope for
