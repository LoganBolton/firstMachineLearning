robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database after seeing this film you may think duvalls appearance is reincarnation at its best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all tootruetolife especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
