convicts is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day and by extension the life of its main character soll robert duvallbr br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost actionpacked in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact hes just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light  warmthbr br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting as far as im concerned theres no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january 1931 create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from himbr br perhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more highstrung western type picture if slowpaced stage productions dont interest you terribly youll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more oftenbr br enjoy
