as alan rudolphs breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordons mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable its surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughterhouse five mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why its brilliant it stays almost entirely faithful to vonneguts book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any authors work can claim that vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better endorsement than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s its a mournful inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night  it doesnt even take a familiarity with vonneguts work to fully appreciate it as slaughterhouse five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema
