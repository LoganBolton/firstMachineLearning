just watched this early bugs bunny first time hes named here and elmer fudd cartoon on the thadblog as linked from youtube this was chuck jones first time directing the wascally wabbit and as a result bugs has a different voice provided by mel blanc than the brooklynbronx one were more familiar with in fact according to thad hes channeling jimmy stewart his shy boy type personality of that time anyway after elmer buys his pet bugs goes all obnoxious on him by turning the radio real loud pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower and saying turn off those lights whenever elmer catches him in his bed even with the different voice bugs is definitely his mischievous self and i laughed myself blue the whole time according to thad there was an additional scene at the end of elmer just giving the house to bugs after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point so its just as well that cut scene is lost anyway i highly recommend elmers pet rabbit
