this is a very very early bugs bunny cartoon as a result the character is still in a transition periodhe is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isnt quite right in addition the chemistry between elmer and bugs is a little unusual elmer is some poor sap who buys bugs from a pet shopthere is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens however despite this this is still a very enjoyable film the early bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations in later films he messed with elmer yosimite sam and others because they started itthey messed with the rabbit but in this film he is much more like daffy duck of the late 30s and early 40sa jerk who just loves irritating others a true anarchist instead of the hero of the later cartoons while this isnt among the best bug bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and its interesting to see just how much hes changed over the years
