whoever said that horror wasnt an educational film genre huh thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts  mind forever thank you hammer the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one ive been looking forward to seeing mainly because the guy in the directors chair was don sharp one of britains finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films like kiss of the vampire and rasputin the mad monk as well as some overlooked independent productions like dark places and psychomania his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror but its actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon the demonic guardian of the abyss the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device when he picks up a clearly petrified girl whos running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics but david fischers screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits among which a highly inventive climax theres also plenty of tension to admire the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie recommended
