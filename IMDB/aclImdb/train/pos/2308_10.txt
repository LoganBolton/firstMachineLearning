i checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldnt have been any more pleasantly surprised my mom and i watched this film together and we thoroughly enjoyed it it isnt the typical chickflick with a sappy love story and tears all the way through but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end its an ending where although unexpected and tragic the movies overall effect is not harmed by it i think reese witherspoon was a great actress even in this film her debut and this is definitely worth watching i didnt recognize many of the supporting actors but they all play their important supporting roles well the man in the moon is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time most women can definitely relate to everythingfrom witherspoons words her subtle glances and her not so subtle emotions raging like the typical teenage girl while shes playing a character confused about love she does not come across as silly and immature which was much appreciated considering many movies today
