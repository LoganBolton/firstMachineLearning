i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want  if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film Â– a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killedbr br 710 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny
