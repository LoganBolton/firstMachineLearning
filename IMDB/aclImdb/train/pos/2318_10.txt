i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese witherspoons portrayal of dani trant a 14yearold tomboy in rural louisiana circa 1957 she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister maureen a now rarely seen emily warfield and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative baptist upbringing then seventeen year old court foster jason london the son of her mothers close friend gail strickland moves in next door dani experiences her first crush while court enjoys her company and willful spirit dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving dani behind the sisters close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts which only deepens when court dies in a tragic accident the girls then are made to realize how much they need each otherbr br sam waterson and tess harper are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their daughters individuality at the same time trying to keep the family together the beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis presley the platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the films atmosphere of a simpler timebr br a touching comingofage film with a timeless message
