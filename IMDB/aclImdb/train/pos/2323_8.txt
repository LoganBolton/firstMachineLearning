the man in the moon is a pretty good movie it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects i wouldnt say the film was terribly original but what is these daysbr br the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age and does quite a good job jason london does a fine job as well and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston who did a fantastic job with his role i really liked sams character matthew trant a lot at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread but in the end you really like his character the rest of the cast was very good as wellbr br if youre into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you then you ought to watch this film id suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something youd be interested in then go for it anyhow hope you enjoy the film thanks for readingbr br chris
