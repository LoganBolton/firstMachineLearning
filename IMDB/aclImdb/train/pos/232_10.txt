what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friendsbr br the story has a truetolife flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolvebr br not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and ahhh moments to share and enjoy
