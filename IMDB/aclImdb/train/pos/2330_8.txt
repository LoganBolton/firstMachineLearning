this show is good i like the acting funny bits and the cuteness of it the actors lee pace ann friel etc they all did great in the show the show started off great with its funny illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly as what people said the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway and now i really hate the fact that its going to be cancelled why doesnt abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done i really wanna know how the storys going to be i think it should be given a chance as therere still so many viewers who love it
