this show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between pushing daisies style and anyone elses was not a steal yes ive seen amelie pushing daisies is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original rather there are too few shows on tv that have this kind of quirky charm the greatest similarity is to dead like me but pd comes by that similarity honestly bryan fuller created both shows both shows involve an undead young woman for example this show never stopped being funny and charming and it was always odd yet was consistently humanebr br i must say a word about the conventions of ongoing story lines some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first and several subsequent episodes ned seems to get away with causing the death of chucks father without consequences of any kind first of all this must be a new definition of without consequences of any kind because in spite of the fact that ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of chucks father he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done further about a dozen episodes into the series ned finally did confess to chuck that he had caused her fathers death with his gift now there are no police to charge people with magically causing one persons death by bringing another person back to life so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance in other words its between ned and chuck who was not inclined to forgive ned anytime soonbr br but this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas i remember when david carusos character on nypd blue did something wrong and it seemed he got away with itfor a whole yearthen he got caught and was forced to resign from the job and left the show the point is viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode and is not caught in that episode that he has gotten away with it there is always next weekand maybe even next year
