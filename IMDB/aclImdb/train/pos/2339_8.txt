i love this show now im not a big fan of many science fiction shows so if it bares any resemblance to them i didnt notice i like the storybook quality of the cinematography i even like the love story even though as i am enjoying it i wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as ned cannot touch chuck or else well you know i even like chuck i dont find her annoying at all and i generally hate overly sweet nice perfect characters i even like the narrators voice even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some walgreens commercials i could nitpick about all the other things about neds predicament and how the writers are going to address it in the future but i just rather watch and wait and see what tale the writers weave
