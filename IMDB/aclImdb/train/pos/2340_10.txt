i instantly fell in love with pushing daisies this show manages to put a smile on my face with its great storytelling witty dialog and great acting but thats not all it also manages to keep you until the end the basic idea behind the show  bringing people back to life with one touch ending the undead status with a second  is interesting and could still be in later seasons but the suspenseful murder cases the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience but pushing daisies is more than its parts it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and im looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season
