this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film its worth a look as its far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all its not a reality show im wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that which lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bentbr br while some decry the premise i think its really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost whisperer and medium i think its the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earlbr br oh and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path id recommend it its not as strange as twin peaks was but its got a serious kink to it
