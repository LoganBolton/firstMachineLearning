thank god abc picked this up instead of fox the best description for those in the know is really wonderfalls meets dead like me in the best way possiblebr br im not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy checkered floors pies talking toys gravelings and other mischievous items  while a bit burtonesque i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesnt require j depp or hb carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest
