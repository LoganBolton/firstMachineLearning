this show is quickwitted colorful dark yet fun hip and still somehow clean the cast including an awesome rotation of special guests ie molly shannon paul rubens thestaplerguyfromofficespace is electric its got murder romance family and zombies without ever coming off as cartoony somehow you really connect with these characters the whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me something of a skeptic if i do say so myself totally engrossed and coming back for more every wednesday night i just reread this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it it really is that good i just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so i thought id send off a flare of good will this is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits cant figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it do yourself a huge favor if you havent already and enjoy this gem while it lasts ok so one more thing this show is clever what that means is that every armchair criticwriter in hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it defending themselves with an i couldve written that type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated hollywood hotel room in other words the internet this is a general interestanonymous website before you give your wednesday tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet critics arent commenting on give my fave show a spin its fun good unpretentious fun
