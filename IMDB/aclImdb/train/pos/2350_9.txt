i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the writers strike wont brutally end the beginnings of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting charlotte chuck is the oncedeadbutnotanymore childhood friend and sunny spot of neds life olive is the jealous but goodhearted waitress oh and add the dog jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of neds special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and goodhearted way and id recommend it to anyone
