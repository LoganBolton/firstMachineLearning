first i want to clarify that the average users inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates you dont need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a wrinkle in timebr br i say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of layitallout television that leaves no room for imagination or wonderbr br its nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experiencebr br the hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show the 1950sesque setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure realitybr br this show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to televisionbr br pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list
