i have to say when pushing daisies came out i was immediately won out by the fairytale like setting of such grimness the narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as well ned lee pace baking pies and that bringing them back to life was just as routinebr br the trio of ned emerson cod chi mcbride and charlotte chuck charles anna friel plus sometimessidekick olive snook kristin chenoweth who made the musical wicked such a delight made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness it definitely deserves the title of a romantic comedydramabr br ned and chuck made for a shy and notquitereadyforlove couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they cannot touch  an obstacle that seems to be truly no obstacle with aids such as gloves cellophane and quirky schedules around the apartment but despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when ned gives chuck the beehives the presence of olive though makes for some breakoutinsong moments in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couplebr br second season sharply declined putting a damper on a show that had real potential on some of the episodes the plot line was rushed and awkward making you ask what just happened in both the overall deadpersonoftheweek plot and in the overriding plot line the addition of chucks father plus two halfbrothers for ned didnt help and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled didnt the episode comfort food feel like the episode bitter sweets in the fact that the deadpersonoftheweek died in food a few touching moments the beehives happened to help advance the relationship between chuck and ned but every time they got close the writers decided to throw in another monkey wrench rather than let the relation develop oliver comes back from the monastery chucks dead father comes back to life and doesnt go back you get the picturebr br shame it didnt work out but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way just enough pleasantvillesque colorhappysmiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that its not dead like me then again its in pushing daisies time according to creator bryan fuller so it makes it plausible againbr br it should have lasted longer but its merely wistful thinking at this point kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this shortlived gem
