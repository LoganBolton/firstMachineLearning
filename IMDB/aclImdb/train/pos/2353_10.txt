pushing daisies for sure is one of the best tv shows of its genre in the last 5 years agree you with that or not bryan fuller the creator has an amazing creative mind hes the mind behind other great tv shows as dead like me 2003 wonderfalls 2004 and the other one not as great as these ones but also interesting heroes 2006 its a mix of the marvelous worlds brian fuller created in previous tv shows mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings something that a fairytale always is so being a kind of fairytale you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be toldbr br a gift always comes with a curse and what is sweet can also be bitter thats so ned lee pace the piemaker is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef he can give life to the dead with just a touch this could be a power that everybody would die  or live  for if wasnt for another simple and very sad thing he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again the curse of this amazing gift doesnt stops there everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute another specie of that one would die instantly hes a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love chuck anna friel if wasnt for another sad fact she was dead he gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does but this love is untouchable the truly kiss of death and thats how this beautiful modern fairytale startsbr br when i heard about pushing daisies for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar or maybe some kind of tribute to everything that tim burton has created since peewees big adventure 1985 to big fish 2003 and charlie and the cholate factory 2005 the results could not be better the world around the pie hole was magnificent the stories around ned and detective cod chi mcbride to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in tv but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as chuck and olive kristin chenoweth in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors not only that you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters even those ones with the most deep dark humorsbr br forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things the actors here are top of note lee pace is tender soft and contained as the character asks for anna friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be but the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as chi mcbride detective emmerson cod swoozie kurtz as lilly charles ellen greene as vivian charles and kristin chenoweth as olive snook swoozie kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing but if the best dialogs are given by swoozie and her character the best funny moments are given by kristin chenoweth seems that shes improvising all the time shes so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved also theres the chemistry between actors and their characters that are also amazingbr br there are no words to express what this tv show really is and what it was meant to be for those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had childhoodbr br truth be told tv has never been so daring in a tv show as with this amazing one pushing daisies was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful its true that tv doesnt respect great tv shows as those ones bryan fuller created  except heroes thats still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones
