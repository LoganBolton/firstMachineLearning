pushing daisies is just a lovely fairy tale with shades of amelies aesthetic and romance its got a beautiful palette its shots well thought out and detailed its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real its imagination great and its romance deepbr br watch the blue in the sky pop out at you as blue cant be found in the rest of the sets or shots with few exceptionsbr br watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scenebr br its score is gorgeous its cast is supremely likable theres great music and the two leading romantic stars cant touch each other or shell die how much more sexual tension do you need actually i had wished they found a way around this one but cest la viebr br it is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with and i recommend it highly there hasnt been other television quite like it and i would like to see more it got me through a flu one crappy week as it makes for good companybr br bring it back
