jeff wincott is not only a hunk he can kick butt this movie has some of the best martial arts moves ive seen in a very long time ok so maybe bridgette nielson isnt the first person id hire to play a ruthless politician she did a great job nontheless and lets not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expertstuntwoman karen sheperd so shes not cynthia rothrock who cares shes just as good if not better just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie one word ouch my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible because if you havent seen it youre really missing out on some great martial arts action
