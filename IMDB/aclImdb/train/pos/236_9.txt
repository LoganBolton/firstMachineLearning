it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writerdirector it has the aura of realitybr br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseannabr br with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachmans hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feelgood quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchbr br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedbr br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means the loved ones
