pendragon pictures new film h g wells war of the worlds the first faithful adaptation of the original novel has been in development for about 5 years a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year march 2005 but this never happened the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielbergs version which hits theatres june 29br br i liked this film with certain reservationsbr br how faithful is the adaptation its not quite 100 faithful to wells book but 90  95 faithful is good enough for me at least several scenes were totally new such as ogilvy the astronomers confrontation with a farmer and the unnamed writernarrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin but on the whole this film follows the book very closely  certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george palbr br its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget the majority of it seems to have been shot bluescreen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots and scenes of crowded city streets the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game numerous scenes in horsecarriages were faked  i guess they couldnt afford to rent a horse the only scenes shot for real seem to be those in open fields or forestsbr br but within those budget restrictions they managed to do quite a lot artistically the film looks right the martians and their tripods are quite well done and very true to wells descriptions i was particularly impressed with the heat ray although the thunder child sequence which should have been one of the films highlights is very disappointing its a great shame that they couldnt afford more actual sets or better quality animationbr br the acting and direction wont win any oscars for the most part they are competent not bad but not outstanding the music is quite good also though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composersbr br im actually glad this didnt get a theatrical release because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen as it stands i would rate this similarly to a bbctv adaptation of classic literaturebr br a few nitpicks most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters mostly red this may have been an artistic choice but it is used very inconsistently and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd and the writernarrators obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scenebr br bottom line  is it worth seeing if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations and get into the story i think you will enjoy this especially if youve actually read the original h g wells novel if however you are easily put off by cheap production values youd best pass on this unless youre a mst3k fan be warned however that the film runs a full 3 hours so i dont recommend watching it all in one sittingbr br btw an entirely different version of war of the worlds aka invasion came out on dvd the same month that spielbergs hit the theatres httpimdbcomtitlett0449040 this was also made on a budget but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film  but its much better and to top it off jeff wayne is making an animated film of his bestselling album from 1978 but that wont be out until 2007
