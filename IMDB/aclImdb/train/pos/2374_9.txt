the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h g wells great novel war of the worlds this is perhaps the least wellknown and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th century 1900  using wells original setting in and near woking englandbr br imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films where the ending might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature so lets get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease against which they have no immunity if thats a spoiler so be it after a book and 3 other films including the 1953 classic you ought to know how this endsbr br this film which follows wells plot in the main is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19thearly 20th century photography although filmed in a widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs rather than black colors are often reminiscent of handtinting at other times colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films which didnt use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality even going from blackwhite to sepiawhite to bluewhite to reddishwhite and so on  as youll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately retrograde of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hairbr br this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells original narrative  as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story wells description of the martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural england  plus a few scenes in london involving the narrators brother the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark big ben but at least doesnt dwell unduly on the devastation of londonbr br the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what wells terms the rout of mankind he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest where they discover an awful fact the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful hooting the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder cheers from the gallery british curates are so often utterly insufferablebr br this film lasts almost 3 hours going through wells story in welcome detail its about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact a word about the acting dont expect awardwinning performances theyre not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them however have had very abbreviated film careers often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana in his 2nd film the curate is john kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother henderson is played with some conviction by w bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by james lathrop in his first filmbr br this is overall a splendid film portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hypedup competitors if you want to see h g wells war of the worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film
