i didnt mind all the walking people really did walk places back then it loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians i too was disappointed by the effects in particular the thunderchild scene which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book but i cant praise this film enough for its faithfulness to wellss story its about time the actors are likable and the performances are charming also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie halls truly great musical score it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london
