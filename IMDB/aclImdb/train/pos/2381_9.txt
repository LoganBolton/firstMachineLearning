the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to hg wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings
