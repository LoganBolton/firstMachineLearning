for a long time the menagerie was my favorite star trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by city on the edge of forever what i used to prefer about menagerie was that its more hardcore star trek with this fascinating backstory to the thencurrent trek storyline i still think its fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a twopart episode though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of spock being courtmartialed is a clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance given the talosians mindcontrol abilities and captain pikes condition why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy sts only twoparter
