it is a well known fact that when gene roddenberry first pitched star trek to nbc the original pilot episode the cage was rejected for being too cerebral when the series was given another chance roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon and did so by writing the menagerie which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still at the time an unaired episodebr br this time rather than exploring a new planet kirk and his crew are on starbase 11 paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise christopher pike sean kenney now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident pike joins his successor on the starship where an unpleasant surprise awaits spock who used to serve under pike has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for talos iv a planet which is offlimits the punishment is death since pike and spocks last visit there 13 years earlier naturally being a logical creature spock turns himself in and arranges a courtmartial so that he can justify his actionsbr br theres no need to say more about the plot since the rest will play out in part 2 what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe by coming up with a particular type of flashback to say more would be too much that allows everyone on screen and off to see what could have been of trek had nbc not turned down the original project in particular its fun to see jeffrey hunter who was unable to return in the menagerie play pike as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and nimoys early days as spock whose personality hadnt been fully established yet this is the only time in the entire series that everybodys favorite vulcan spontaneously grinsbr br in short not just a great mystery episode but also a treat for those who cant be bothered to track down the cage in its original form its available as part of the season 3 box set
