the menagerie parts one and two was the only 2parter during the 3year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot the cage the move was made out of necessity to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time one positive outcome back then was that audiences unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history though they still used terms such as united space fleet in these early episodesbr br the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot the enterprise is diverted to starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans astonishingly though even mccoy belabors the fact that spocks vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain pike now horribly crippled well spock is half human we tend to forget or has he simply gone mad it may very well be for hes directing enterprise to talos iv a planet so offlimits its the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleets books when the jig is up theres a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy as uhura looks on in shock even kirk usually steady as a captain should be doesnt know what to make of his first officers illogical conductbr br in the 3rd and final acts we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior when capt pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers we really dont know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish  and thats another thing that makes this a very good 2parter  we really need to find out what its all about in the 2nd part not only is spock facing severe penalties but it looks like kirks career may be finished as well double jeopardy folks this is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts none were available in the earlier the enemy within when the crafts were really needed theres also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase  this was the only way to visualize such things back then finally check out kirks smug approach at the start of the episode  boy do things go sideways on him as the story progresses
