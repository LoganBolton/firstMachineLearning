i work with children from 0 Â– 6 years old and they all love the doodlebops the doodlebops are energetic vibrant and appealing once they start singing were the doodlebops were the doodlebops were the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because were laughing and were singing all day it is almost impossible not to join them in song the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun each show is an adventure the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to the doodlebops is an refreshing high action alternative to regular childrens television programs
