i really enjoyed this movie it took a pretty dark storythat of shakespeares macbeth and wrapped it in a quirky often funny and poignant modern yarnbr br kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and macbeths scotland together under one roof the opposing worlds act tobr br really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold perrineau as the chorus a part which doesnt exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up the ending stands out among little indies ive seen for its closure and originality
