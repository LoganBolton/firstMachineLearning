this was a hit in the south by southwest sxsw film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by ers gloria reuben and a scenerychewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word macbeth is thought to bring on the plays ancient curse the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a wellknown pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the greeneyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes directors commentary and some deleted scenes as well
