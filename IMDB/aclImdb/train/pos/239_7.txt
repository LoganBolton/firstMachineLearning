i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didnt have the best time mainly because i didnt know about ned kelly or his storybr br but since this is a biopic its important to at least know what to expect from the characterbr br i dont know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true i dont think hes portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but thats just my opinionbr br this is a solid westerntype movie for everybodys tastes heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screenbr br give this movie a chance if it airs on cable otherwise i dont think i could recommend it
