ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and marner particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldnt have even known about itbr br who cares its christopher freakin walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan hes thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if youve ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapbr br a fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
