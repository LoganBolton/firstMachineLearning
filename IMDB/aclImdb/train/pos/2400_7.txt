i do see what my forebears saw in the youthful bette davis shes splendid throughout this almostmadcap political comedy which actually stars warren williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony vivienne osborne is brilliant as his ex and i found myself rooting for her throughout the williams character is not at all sympathetic and hes not even a decent opbr br guy kibbee is one of the best at what he does as a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the progressive party if youre of a political mind you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional progressive party of williams and kibbee i could draw exact parallels but were not here for thatbr br this is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies if youve ever watched any of the old wheeler  woolsey titles half shot at sunrise the rainmakers youll find frank mchugh as williamss right arm looking and behaving a lot like bert wheeler he had me fooledbr br yes both my wife and i recommend this one
