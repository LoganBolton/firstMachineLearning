wow i cant believe im the first and only one to post a comment on this great moviebr br although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard granted most people probably either think hes too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but were both the same age and from the same generation and ive watched this guy so many times that hes one of my favorites now this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk another great lillard filmbr br baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to craziness also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent donofrio a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isnt too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene br br its a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and its a timebomb waiting to explode matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business vinces character is a bit deranged and skitzs throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the filmbr br the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it its a great movie and id highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies critics probably wont like this movie but they dont watch movies cause they like movies anyway
