the first time i saw this film i loved it it was differentbr br i am a christian bible believing i dont go along with the crowd of right wing believers i dropped out of that atmospherebr br to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do i call it the judas syndromebr br judas didnt get it even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this worldbr br this film certainly showed some of thatbr br i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciplesbr br also he was a very gorgeous jesusbr br its a watchover and over moviebr br very satisfying
