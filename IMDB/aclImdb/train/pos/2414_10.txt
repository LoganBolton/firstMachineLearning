monarch cove was one of the best friday nights drama shown in a long timei am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime sooneach person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true however the movie needs to continue for a long time i would love to see bianca and jakes child growup and get a major role in the movie along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future also bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her lifeit was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems but the family business needed to be restored to working statusand let us see how jake and bianca survive through the marriage years
