going berserk is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen period sure its kinda low budget but its a nonstop comedic tour de force there are tons of memorable quotes for instance when his soontobe fatherinlaw asks him how much he earns candy says oh i pull down anywhere between thirty andeleven thousand dollars a year sir oh course it is candys delivery that sells it just classic stuff eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker a clip of his horrible low budget movie kung fu u will have you rollingbr br so if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem i cant recommend this movie enough
