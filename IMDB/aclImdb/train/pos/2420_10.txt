if you enjoy the subtle yes i said subtle actions and reactions of john candy you cant help but like this film pronounced fillum by salvatore dipasquale the unobservant and uninformed watcher always saw candy as a broad actor  a big buffoon and sometimes he was see stripes and splash but when given the opportunity he could really be razorsharp and quite subtle its too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because well never get to see more of the other oh yeah the movie one can watch going berserk over and over i know i have with the frequency of caddyshack its just that good the plot although a little convoluted is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind it allows candy and the always underrated joe flaherty and eugene levy to bounce off of candyand they bounce hard definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed sctv or candys other work
