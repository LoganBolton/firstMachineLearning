i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic casper the friendly ghost cartoon figured it was an early one since casper didnt look right the same way porky pig doesnt look right in the old 1930s cartoons but i digressbr br anyway this episode in the friendly phantoms afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie i remember being happy to see casper have a friend as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him screaming a ghostbr br casper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up i hate to leave you with a semispoiler but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you cant really be too ambiguous besides anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens nextbr br the finale is a bit heartbreaking in fact its probably the saddest ive ever felt watching a cartoon but that only means that it moved me which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others or heck the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me  i havent seen it since but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy againbr br id give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars second only to the warner bros cartoon peace on earth this is the most ive ever been moved by an animated short
