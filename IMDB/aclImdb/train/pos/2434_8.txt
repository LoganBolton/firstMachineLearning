ive often wondered just how much casper was meant for childrenwith all the issues revolving around his identity in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child as his home is a cemetery plot as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film maybe casper was meant more as a morality play or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in reality cartoonsbr br theres good boos tonight is a wellanimated projectno doubt there but the plot development involving the fox who becomes caspers friend but meets a tragic end is a concernbr br give famous studios creditthey tackle death with respectbut the stark image of caspers mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children though the denouement does offer a happy ending but i wont give away the ending and the violence is rather steep even for 1940s standardsbr br this might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to childrenbut i wouldnt pop it into the vcr for a perky cartoon break
