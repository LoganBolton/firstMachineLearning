i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes when i first purchased casper  friends spooking about africa i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost 1945 but when i saw the next cartoon theres good boos tonight 1948 it made me break down i couldnt believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing caspers fox get killed i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons this is the saddest one of all it was so depressing i just couldnt watch it again its just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie i know its a classicbut its too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny but when i think about this casper cartoon i think about my cats
