generally i like something light and fun so this film shouldnt have appealed to me but it grabbed me from the start the story of a familys choices and challenges seem obvious but it raises the question over and over what if it was my family my choice i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt it was in places difficult to watch but more difficult to turn away the story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch it shows what filmmakers can do without sex violence or special effects a good story is a good story all by itself the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones like real life you really dont know whatll happen next or why people do the things that they do
