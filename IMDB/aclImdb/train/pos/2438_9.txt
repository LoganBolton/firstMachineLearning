this was a gem amazing acting from the leads liam cunningham orla brady and all the supporting cast the movie raises a subject not only pertinent to ireland and irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities with intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family the title love divided couldnt capture it any better even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the 50th seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and pogroms are starting reminded me of russian history the intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately its deeply hidden inside the human nature just like in the movie the liam cunninghams character says the hatred had always been there under the surface it was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful the story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better stronger liam cunninghams character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be again acting is a top notch story is fastpaced irish countryside is as beautiful as ever highly recommended
