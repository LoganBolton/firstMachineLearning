this movie is about a side of ireland that americans dont normally see the narrowminded religiously prejudiced side of the friendliest race in the world the movie by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events is fairly accurate though they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the actionbr br the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church did organise vetoes of minorities before protestants it was the jewsbr br the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
