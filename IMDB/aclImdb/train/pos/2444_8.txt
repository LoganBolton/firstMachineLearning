george lopez in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i havent seen every episode but i still enjoy it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where amy sandra bullock walked into a moving piece of machinery if you want to know why youll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up id like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though new episodes can currently be seen i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
