george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesnt but this show is a work of art its not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it and jokes that re memorable at that this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an dyslexic teenager i dont know who writes this show but that person does a great job if they had just continued the show im sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country if you are looking for a good traditional comedy then george lopez is the show for you the one bad thing is the title george lopez really imagine the fresh prince of belair being will smith cmon man but otherwise this show is genius 1010
