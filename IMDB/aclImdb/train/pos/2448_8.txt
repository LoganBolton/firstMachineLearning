yes its over the top yes its a bit clich√©d and yes constance marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the shows still fun to watch since its a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gagsbr br george lopez is funny dont take him seriously and the shows a winner im sure he didnt intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilariousbr br i do have to say that the one big dark bitter spot is benny i hate the characterso much so that anytime shes on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i dont have to hear her there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george as the character would stand by such a deplorable person for so longbr br even so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show now theres a bad sitcom
