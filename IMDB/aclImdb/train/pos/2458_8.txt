when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didnt plan on changing it but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward so what have we theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen denmark it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from bend it like beckham where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brothers wedding by doing kung fu and we have a love story and a competition of course too after i accepted this this really turned out to be a gripping emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu im not an expert though the lead actress semra turan is not only denmarks female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress rest of the supporting cast is okay camera good kung fu intense sidenotes  the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right  the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge  xian gao a chinese cinematic kung fu instructoractor hidden tiger crouching dragon played the lead roles masterbr br if you get the chance to see this in cinema do it youll probably have a good and intense experience and i dont know if this works on small screen as well
