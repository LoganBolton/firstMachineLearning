the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom simply put the movie was spectacularly average its not bad but its really not very good the editing is good the film is wellpaced the direction is competent and assured the story is plodding the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush the accents are impenetrable if youre from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery or as i like to call it orlando bloom by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie i have to say i so did not care by that pointbr br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range although the oftpresent im pretty and confused look is prominent so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price other than that just dont see it its neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining
