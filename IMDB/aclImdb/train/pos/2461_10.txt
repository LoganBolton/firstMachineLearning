kenneth branaghs hamlet hits all the marks the acting is magnificent the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous the oscarnominated costumes and sets are stunning and patrick doyles score also oscarnominated is sensitive and moving oh yeah  the screenplay by some guy named will s isnt too bad either film critics ribbed branagh for receiving the films fourth oscar nod for adapting the screenplay but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one i cant think of many better ways to make four hours fly bybr br nearly every decision branagh makes works brilliantly the use of englands blenheim palace for exteriors the edwardian dress and the staging of to be or not to be in a hall of mirrors to name a few the casting of hollywood luminaries such as robin williams billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor parts can be distracting but thats nitpicking the principal cast excels derek jacobi captures the conflicted nature of claudius kate winslet acutely depicts ophelias descent into madness julie christie brings passion to her portrayal of gertrude richard briers is pitchperfect as the conniving polonius and nicholas farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship every speech every line every word is delivered with passion and conviction there isnt a wasted moment in the entire film the final scenes magnify the extent of shakespeares tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptationsbr br branaghs hamlet is a bold ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of shakespeares language with equally eloquent imagery its arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed Â– strong praise but well deserved
