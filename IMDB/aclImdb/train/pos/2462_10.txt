it would require the beauty and eloquence of shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat nevertheless ill give it a gobr br as far as adaptations of hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play still this is no guarantee for a firstrate movie or even a good one usually im not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in hollywood today namely that movies should be at least two hours long preferably three is one that hopefully wont last long few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting making a fourhourlong movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking but kenneth branagh pulls it off with flying colours he has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie i was completely engrossed from start to finishbr br the cast is excellent with kenneth branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance he manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him kate winslet was a positive surprise i must say i didnt know what to expect really ive always liked her well enough as an actor but wasnt sure she could pull off playing shakespeare well she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance she is the best ophelia i have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful other brilliant performances are derek jacobi as claudius richard briers as polonius and nicholas farrell as horatio to name but a few i liked the fact that branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles i especially enjoyed the sparring between hamlet and the gravedigger played by billy crystalbr br the setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier gothic settings it is overall much lighter than other versions ive seen more colourful and lavish but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play it is exceptional stylish and aesthetically pleasing a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well the music by patrick doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie one can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this i am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an academy award for best picture even more so that it wasnt even nominated there is no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter this is as close to perfection as you can hope to getbr br to sum up a stunning work of pure genius and i cannot see how anyone could top this my hats off to you mr branagh
