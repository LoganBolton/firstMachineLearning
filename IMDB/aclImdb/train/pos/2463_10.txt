william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it but its also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branaghs hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing even if it went just over four hoursbr br we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his fathers death so i wont go into the details of the story i will however tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography but the actors interpretations of each character i doubt youll find a better polonius than richard briers delicious portrayal plus you cant go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also derek jacobi a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamletbr br of course we must talk about kenneth branagh he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare henry v he outdoes himself with hamlet sure oliviers presence was captivating but i think branaghs performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen its almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he wasnt nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though br br all in all youll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bards best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare you definitely need to check this movie out even if you dont really care for shakespeare the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think youll be able to sit through all of it at once but youll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more
