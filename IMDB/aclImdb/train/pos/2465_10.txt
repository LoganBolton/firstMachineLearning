a lot of people dont think branaghs hamlet film is all that good but i must admit i think it is splendid like virtually every production of shakespeare it has problems and it has had to make hard choices not all of which work out the thing about the secret doors everywhere for instance simply doesnt work that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming this is the biggest problem with this production and while its a biggie im also inclined to say that its the only problem almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully all right so branagh is a mite too old for the title role and the relationship with ophelia seems a little forced and he gets too hysterical at times but thats it no other complaints even with these faults i think this version is a seminal one and if its not as powerful a drama as it ought to be its every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be we get the complete text of the longest version of the play innovatively and expensively brought to the screen mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices  even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with but in a staging of shakespeare it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language for that one must delve into the print versions of the playsbr br all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic incl jack lemmon julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever and even the american actors are astounding esp charlton heston as the player king  who would have thought it a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage and when a critic in the front row couldnt stand his hammy acting and said out loud this is terrible heston reportedly retorted right from the stage well i didnt write this crap of course it may not be true but its a funny story  and if true a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here robin williams as young ozric is perhaps not young enough for the part but he makes it a comical one which is warrantedbr br overall it is a very wellproduced version with most of the key scenes being to my mind supremely memorable of course i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare and around the same time as luhrmanns formidable romeojuliet and it made a great impression on me which must account for some of my fondness for itbr br all things considered i must pronounce branaghs hamlet to be my favorite one with derek jacobis 1980 bbc version a close second i probably like branaghs shakespeare work more than most finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text in the world of shakespeare acting the two brightest luminaries remain olivier and branagh and while olivier is the superior actor branagh brings shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice and transforms it into churlish easygoing populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity branagh i believe brings out a truer shakespeare than the world has yet seenbr br and so 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet
