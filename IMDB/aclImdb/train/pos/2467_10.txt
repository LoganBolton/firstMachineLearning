why didnt this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing interpretaion of an oftfilmedperformed piece the visuals are breathtaking especially in widescreenthe pan  scan really kills this films wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and branaghs passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does jacobi is especially perfect as hamlets murderous uncle he doesnt play him as a mustache curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlets fakereal madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into branaghs vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece
