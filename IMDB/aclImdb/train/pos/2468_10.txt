i went to see hamlet because i was in between jobs i figured 4 hours would be great ive been a fan of branagh dead again henry v i was completely overwhelmed by the direction acting cinematography that this film captured like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly branagh doesnt play hamlet he is hamlet he was born for this when i watch this film im constantly trying to find faults ive looked at the goofs and havent noticed them how he was able to move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me this movie was shot in 70 mil its a shame that columbia hasnt released a widescreen version of this on vhs i own a dvd player and id take this over titanic any day so columbia if youre listening put this film out the way it should be watched and i dont know what happened at the oscars this should have swept best picture best actor best direction best cinematography what films were they watching i felt sorry for branagh at the oscars when he did a tribute to shakespeare on the screen they should have been giving a tribute to branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time
