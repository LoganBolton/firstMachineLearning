how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together well i couldnt and so i rented this mess of a moviebr br i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young mans legend i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow not because the story is complicated but because it is slow even with a slow story ledger and bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters br br though i flounder to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history considering how young the country is this is very rare and should be appreciated and the film does have some good actions sequences br br 610 see it for historical valueyeah rightand thats the only reason to see it
