i had never read shakespeares hamlet before watching it but i did have a shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it my view on the movie may be partially biased since i had never read the play before but i got pulled into this movies grasp shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of hamlet is definitely one of his best achievementsbr br but now on to the moviebr br i found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus were able to articulate it quite well leonardo in romeo and juliet is nothing compared to kenneth branagh and the king the thing i liked about this was that it worked very well as a movie and not as a play you are studying you dont need to be affluent with shakespeare to relate to all the misery hamlet has to go through i would recommend this movie to a wide audiencebr br thats my two cents
