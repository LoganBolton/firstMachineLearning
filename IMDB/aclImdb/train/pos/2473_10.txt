when i first read hamlet i couldnt help but think of the ending of outrageous fortune where bette midler puts down the play because of how indecisive he is and says give me romeo any day five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not seemed like overkill to me but upon further reading i grew to really appreciate the play ive seen the olivier and gibson movie versionsand part of the nicol williamson version and all of them take their model from olivier the melancholy dane olivier at least did it without being selfindulgent about it but gibson and from what i saw williamson looked like they went to the look ma im acting im acting schoolbr br now here comes kenneth branaghs version which is breathtaking from start to finish it finished 2 on my top ten of 1996behind the english patient and ahead of lone star jerry maguire fargo secrets  lies everyone says i love you flirting with disaster big night and looking for richard and its the best hamlet and maybe the best shakespeare put to film obviously branaghs talents as a filmmaker for making the fulllength version in 70mm print and not losing our interest for four hours is great but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role this was my favorite performance of the year by far branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing hamlet as a normal regular human being and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way and unlike olivier who depended mostly on his voice branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that hamlet goes through but since he plays him as normal none of it seems like scenerychewingbr br the rest of the cast is topnotch as well i didnt even mind jack lemmon though i agree he was the weakest member of the cast the most surprising turn came from charlton heston ive always found him stiff as a board but hes quite commanding as the player king the other big surprise was billy crystal i thought id find him all wrong as the 1st gravedigger but he was his usual funny self while being in character all in all a glorious film
