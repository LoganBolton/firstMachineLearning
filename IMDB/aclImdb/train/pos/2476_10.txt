this was the second of two filmed hamlets in the nineties the first being franco zeffirellis starring mel gibson from 1990 zeffirellis version like laurence oliviers from 1948 was based upon an abridged version of the play with much of shakespeares original text being cut i have never seen tony richardsons 1969 version but as that ran to less than two hours shorter even than zeffirellis i presume that was also abridged kenneth branagh was attempting something much more ambitious a film based on the complete text of the play with a running time of around four hoursbr br with his henry v branagh claimed oliviers crown as the cinemas leading shakespearean confirming his claim with his brilliant much ado about nothing a rare example of a great film based on a shakespeare comedy hamlet was his third shakespeare film as director he also acted as iago in oliver parkers 1995 othello and as one might expect it is very different to much ado the earlier film shot in a villa in the hills of tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside is a joyous summertime film about everything that makes life worth livingbr br hamlet by contrast is set in the depths of winter the flowers in the description of ophelias death suggest that shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer the look of the film is particularly striking both sumptuous and chilly it was filmed at blenheim palace possibly englands most grandiose stately home but also a rather forbidding one the snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry the interior ones formal and elaborate the action is updated to the mid nineteenth century the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms there is a contrast here with zeffirellis film where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone the play is dominated by images of corruption and decay branaghs intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying something rotten in the state of denmarkbr br the film is notable for the large number of bigname actors some of them in very minor roles blink and you might miss john gieldgud or judi dench apparently an allstar cast was required by the production company who were nervous about a fourhour film some of the imported hollywood stars such as robin williams osric did not really come off but others like charlton hestons player king or billy crystals first gravedigger played their parts very well yorick normally only seen as a skull is here seen in flashback played by the british comedian ken dodd brian blessed who often plays jovial characters is cast against type as the ghost and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frighteningbr br of the major characters perhaps the weakest was kate winslets ophelia branaghs leading lady in his first two shakespeare films was his then wife emma thompson but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995 i did however find myself wishing that thompson had been cast in the role although winslet came into her own in the ophelias mad scenes she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane i preferred helena bonham carter in zeffirellis version richard briers plays polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool julie christie also brings dignity to the role of gertrude there is no attempt here as there was with gibson and glenn close in the zeffirelli version to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and hamlet an interpretation which owes more to freud than it does to shakespeare the age difference between christie and branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son which was certainly not the case with close and gibson oliviers gertrude eileen herlie was bizarrely thirteen years younger than himbr br branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy much stress is placed upon the war with norway and the norwegian prince fortinbras a subplot ignored altogether by zeffirelli this emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of claudius sometimes played as a onedimensional villain there is something about derek jacobis performance which suggests that claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust he could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother but chose to rule as a bad king although he is tormented by guilt he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has donebr br branagh a wonderfully fluent speaker of shakespeares verse is superb in the main role like gibson he has little time for the old concept of hamlet as indecisive passive and melancholy his is an active physical energetic hamlet something best shown in his fatal duel with laertes his guiding principle is not worldweary despair but an active disgust with evil and corruptionbr br it was a gamble for branagh to make a fourhour epic and the film did not do well at the box office it was however praised by many critics james berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic my own opinion is that whatever the financial returns may have been branaghs gamble paid off in artistic terms by concentrating on the full text he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of shakespeares most complex play when i reviewed his much ado i said it was the greatest ever film of a shakespeare comedy his hamlet may just be the greatest ever film of a shakespeare tragedy 1010
