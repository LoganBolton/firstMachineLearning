the image of movie studios being financiallydriven instead of creatively is not without truth in fact its more true than false this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a fulllength uncut version of hamlet with his complete creative control among other things of course branagh had to agree to some concessions a starstudded cast and a 25 hour version for wider release but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see could they have at least in this case had enough respect for the material and branaghs vision to create something for only a few people that is not a question that i can answer whatever the reason this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching hamlet everyone knows the story so i will not spend much time on that however unlike other productions of the play stage included this is a completely uncut production which has never been done before according to some shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut leaving the decision of what to include to the directors discretion that being said i have no doubt that had he been able to see it the bard would have been overjoyed with branaghs productionbr br the film is topheavy with film stars although most have mere bit parts all play their parts equally well i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet and while he still may be his performance more than makes up for it hamlet is a complex part displaying every emotion from grief to anger happiness to madness and everything in between branagh nailed it derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion his unique voice is perfect for the role julie christie is also very good as gertrude hamlets caring mother who doesnt realize what is going on until late in the gamebr br the classical actors are cast in bit parts judi dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines but at least theyre in it surprisingly no one takes this to heart everyone gives it their all and it shows special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal who are excellent robin williams is a little too silly but hes not bad his part is pretty small anywaybr br yet this is undeniably branaghs show he adapted one of the most famous plays in history and in so doing he took on a whale of a project its impressive that he got it done but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement what i really liked about this film is that you dont have to be a shakespeare scholar to enjoy it as most people know shakespeare is difficult to digest but branagh and his cast understand this hamlet is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent actingbr br this is a must see for anyone and everyone it may be four hours long but its definitely worth it
