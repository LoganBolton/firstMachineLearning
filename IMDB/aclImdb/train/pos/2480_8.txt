first what i didnt like the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard branagh was really overthetop doing a lot of yelling mostly in my opinion those actors who were not bigname celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams and charlton heston too but i wasnt sure if he was playing at being a hack a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacksbr br what i think speaks very much in this plays favor is that it is accessible shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one mans interpretation of the play they will be seeing it more as shakespeares audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and nobles murder and incest and evil schemes and ghostsand great art if one cares to look for it but in shakespeares day most didnt any more than most people do now branaghs overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from shakespeares art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothingbr br ive got to say one more thing though some people are complaining that its set in the 19th century and that wasnt shakespeares time well in shakespeares time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays shakespeare may have said its in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever but he didnt dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms for example in king john the english and french have cannonsin robin hoods day in julius caesar they talk of chimneys which wouldnt be invented for another thousand years and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli who wasnt even born yet then so i think this objection is sillyyou might as well complain that the play isnt in danish after all they live in denmark dont they
