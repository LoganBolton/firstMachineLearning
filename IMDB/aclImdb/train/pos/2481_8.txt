i admit ive only seen about three of shakespeares plays romeo  juliet macbeth  of course hamlet one i liked the other i found soso macbeth and hamlet i just found a masterpiece im pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play the acting is extremely strong with a cast that features kenneth branagh robin williams and billy crystal how can you lose and the change in time period looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800s plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the shakespearean play will get chills from if youre into this popular drama i highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from shakespearean admirer kenneth branagh
