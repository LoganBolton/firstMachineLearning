those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this films pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be donebr br if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose backstory could have come off the back of a count chocula box the empty acre is the movie for youbr br set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their sixmonthold baby as the couples weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever therebr br the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writerdirectors faith in an intellectual audiencebr br there seems to be a subtext concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically astute the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love
