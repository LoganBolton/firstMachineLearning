this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting if these were white girls would they get the same reaction maybe they would maybe they wouldnt the characters know no limits check my lyrics and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of funthere are so many funny sketches my favorites is the bob the builder one its so silly its genius if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you if you like keeping up appearances it probably isnt3 non blondes is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy shown on tv it is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny it would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced
