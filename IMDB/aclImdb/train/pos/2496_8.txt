no rubbish  no where even near rubbish not an original thats the last thing that could be said of 24 childrenpredictable certainly not although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc it was hilarious funny and witty i particularly liked belinda lang and john pickard  who i believe preformed wonderfullygary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast membersi never quite new why it was cancelled till reading here today about gary olsens death at a relatively young age i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type much more of them and show them here in israelthumbs way up
