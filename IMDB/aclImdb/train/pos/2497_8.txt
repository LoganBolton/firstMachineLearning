indeed drug use warehouse shootemups matrixesque bullet dodging a futuristic city with a mix of asian races and a lonely vampire all in the same movie seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese poprock star and that is exactly what moon child is and more while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy bmovie of the week moon child pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the waybr br the film has a gritty definitely independent feel to it jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition but rather sporadic leaps and bounds giving glimpses into the characters lives and barely scraping at a true plot but the film makes no excuses instead turning the story into one of friendship love trust and betrayal all sugarcoated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society warring gangsters and vampiresbr br hyde as the somber vampire kei is excellent giving depth to the character and balancingout the overlyzealous acting of gackt as sho an orphan who befriends kei leehom wang also shines as the vengeful son who becomes friends with a grownup sho the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayalbr br while the action at times is alltoo unrealistic and special effects appear just to showoff one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features the superstars as actors have their flaws and so do their characters the movie rarely gets boring and ends where it should after jumping about quite a bit moon child is rather enjoyable humorous at times and even very touching it is definitely worth your time
