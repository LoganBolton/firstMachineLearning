i picked this up in the danger after dark box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gorefest and with very bad dialogue which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way that sho gackt develops through the movie as a person the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good considering they arent professional actors and the director did a marvelous job with it all setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboardsbr br on a side note taro yamamotos performance was very surprising the only other film ive seen him in is battle royale where he plays shogo kawada and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo toshi is bright exuberant and hyper serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it so watch out for his performance if youre familiar with battle royale youll be very surprised by himbr br but dont be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box because this isnt really a vampire movie its just a movie with a vampire in it that hydes character is a vampire is almost a background fact with whats really going on in the foreground and you guys will love the last scene its a really moving picture at some points the photography is really well done its definitely something to pick up the next time youre at blockbuster
