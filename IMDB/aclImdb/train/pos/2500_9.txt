would probably be the best word to describe this film in my opinion besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls well that was redundant it was the story that blew me away hurray for takahisa zeze and gackt and i know some people will disagree with me on this one but it wasnt any of the big three actors the guys that played sho son and kei that gave the best performance for me anyway it was taro yamamoto boy 5 from battle royale br br dont get me wrong i like hyde i worship his voice but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit off but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guys body killing the other guys and gackt wasnt at all that bad too i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start nothing much i can say about my background on leehom wang i wont pretend to know him but he carried his own weight with the starstudded cast br br this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations ive ever heard orenji no taiyou forgive my spelling if its wrong while the complete song lasts about nine minutes you wouldnt notice the length because youd be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together br br anyway this movie is a mustsee not only for the fans huge fan base but for those who enjoy scifi futuristic movies asianstyle
