im a fan of both actorssingers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the traileri just think this is a silly oneafter a long waiting timei watched it at last and heres my commentbr br i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about itinstead of it my first applause goes to actinggenerally that japanese movies hasnt got brilliant and actingyet in moonchilds all cast is simply wonderful and got into itespecially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty welli like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous onesas for hyde parthis acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actorrespectively as his character dothroughout the moviei didnt like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budgetit still has brilliant momentsbut the real jewel of the film is storyit has some cheesy moments but its ok for meand the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimeson the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visualsan interesting note asidethis movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautifulnot handsomebeautifulactors of american cinemaactually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiewyet original on its ownonly problem that moonchild is its a bit slow sometimesim a japanese movie fan and i used to that but its not change moonchild has some useless scenes or charactersbut all in allthis movie is really good and very emotional sometimesas for actorssingers duo i hope to see their other movies in futureand i recommend this to everyone who likes vampireactionscifiction and romance films 810
