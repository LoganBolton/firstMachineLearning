i am extremely picky about the films i see id heard about moon child completely by accident ive been a fan of larc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recentlybr br i finally found out the film was being rereleased and picked it up without a second thoughtbr br being as critical as i am about films i will admit the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at timesbut theyre meant too be as another user suggested its the quintessential calm before the storm quoting gary oldman from leonwithout getting into the spoilers the film hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say true friendship is loyalty and like marriage its until death do you partbr br hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into ones soul and evoke response emotionallybr br upon seeing the film for the first time i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in filmthis takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miikes audition and suicide club famebr br mani just cant say enough about this film but ill stop herebr br 1010
