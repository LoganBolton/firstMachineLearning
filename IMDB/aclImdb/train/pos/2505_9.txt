many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie gackt hyde and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan but dont judge it before you watch is what i say gackt and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard its a good film with a touchy story inside several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until i cant stop watching this all over again br br the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language japan but its comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the moviebr br i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life when toshi was killed when sho asked kei to turn yiche to being vampire like him because he wont let her die when shos brother died kei shoot son die and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away even i told that hydes skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scenebr br theres a time where the plot goes too fast like they didnt tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being shos enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is shos brother in lawbr br whatever i love this movie very much  br br this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story
