moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise its easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters the fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else ive ever heard of it doesnt get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire its just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem the way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just dont work which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most partbr br the other area that really stood out to me is the languages the fictional city of mallepa contains various cultural groups and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak japanese gang members speak japanese to each other but chinese when talking to characters of chinese descent possibly the most amusing exchange involves an australian and is conducted in english the actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others languages so its quite a feat that the movie was made at all which i suppose brings me to the lead actorsbr br much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of japans biggest rockstars gackt and hyde as well as taiwanese superstar leehom wang whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them in my opinion leehom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character however any lack of acting ability on gackts part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being overdramatic i wasnt sure if hydes character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across but it doesnt really detract from the movie either waybr br there are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally although this doesnt seem to stop a lot of people i found its best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously its perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends it does have its flaws but overall it was very enjoyable and id highly recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind a few subtitles
