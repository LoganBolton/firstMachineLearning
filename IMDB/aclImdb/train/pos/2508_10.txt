this movie is amazing the plot was justwowbr br i was very surprised by gackts and hydes performance after growing up in the american world of the actors who cant sing and singers who cant actbr br in this movie a young sho gackt comes across a vampire kei hyde over time they form an unlikely friendship kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others the halflife of a vampirebr br its a sad movie but not sappy the plot was very unique and contrary to your typical vampire flick the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancingbr br the only fault i would say the movie had despite its lack of a happyalbeit peacefulÂ—ending would be its multiple languages i had the unsubdued version im lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese so i would recommend getting something with subtitlesbr br all in all the movie was just awesome
