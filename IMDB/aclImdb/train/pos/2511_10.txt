i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything after all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer not possible for so much talent to reside in one person right br br wrong obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along as the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the endbr br at times the acting seems a little over the top i do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character otherwise i wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessedbr br its worth seeing more than once i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two aroundbr br i completely recommend this movie feel free to go in with your doubts but im sure it will find a place on your shelf
