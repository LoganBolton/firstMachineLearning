i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived my worst fears were that it would be plodding as well as well you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about gacktnhydehawt yaoi love that sort of thing dreading it i was very very pleasantly surprised the movie was surprisingly watchable even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nunchucks every two scenes and the acting on gackts part was quite good hyde being um hyde acted as a quasiromantic friendgang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by hes one of my two major beefs with the film itself but the rest of the cast including the child actors in the opening scene were very good at doing what they did which was mostly get shot at and yelled at but my second problem was very minor having to do with the goriness it seemed way too suspensehorror to me like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over really most sincerely dead or lay there burbling for a rather long time but sho just takes the shots repeatedly keels over bubbles a lot while he talks and makes hyde cry all in all if youre a fan of any of the actors or just a jfilm fan its definitely worth a watch
