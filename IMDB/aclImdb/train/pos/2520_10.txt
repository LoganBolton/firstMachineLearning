despite what others had said cough this is my favourite movie of all time i dont know how long i had been waiting to see it but once i finally did i immediately fell in love sure its strange but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour for those who dont know moonchild is one of gackt and hydes first movies they havent done very many at all maybe 3 or 4 tops each so give them some credit we all know that adam sandler wasnt the best at first either i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there but i over look that to find the best points of this movie the emotions displayed and whatnot therefore i have given and always shall give this movie a 10 out of 10
