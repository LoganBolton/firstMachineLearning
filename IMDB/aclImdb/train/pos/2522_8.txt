i must admit at first i wasnt expecting anything good at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackts and hydes image but im glad to say it has much more to offerbr br yes the acting is not that great but it doesnt suck either all the casts well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enoughbr br what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it merges fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality the developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think thats the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angstbr br it fulfills any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone
