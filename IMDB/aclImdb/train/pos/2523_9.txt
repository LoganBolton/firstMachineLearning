when i first heard about moon child i thought it was a joke after a few months i figured i guess its for real the few reviews i read that werent made by squealing fangirls were not very promisingbr br when i was given the opportunity to watch it i was fully prepared to groan wince and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the sillinessbr br i was more than a little surprised and in a good waybr br yes moon child has its moments of cheese camp and general dorkiness  i think thats kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt camui a man not known for his sanity  but all in all it was wholly enjoyablebr br no it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very very heartfelt amusing with fun choreography a touching score and a fun cast i know little of japanese cinema so i cant really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience i was rather impressedbr br if you can enjoy a good action movie a good drama a good comedy see this film at least rent it since its coming to region 1br br on a side note there is zero homosexualhomoerotic content in this film i didnt even see much of a subtext dont let people that read too much into things ruin this for you
