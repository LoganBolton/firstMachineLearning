this is what i call a pre sci fi sci fi movie it gets no better than lugosikarloff in this incredibly good mood type motion picture these two genuine artists are at their very best as is the story linebr br karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity pride and scientific competition i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in br br this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role it might be possible to do it almost as goodbr br this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced as i saidit gets no better no way
