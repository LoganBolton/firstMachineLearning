prof janos rukh boris karloff discovers radium xa powerful force to be used for atomic power unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the darkand his touch causes instant death dr felix benet bela lugosi develops an antidotebut rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged himbr br the plot is silly and the effects that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable but this is still a fun little chiller it moves quickly has some great atmosphere notice rukhs house and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night and karloff and lugosi as always give great performances there is also good acting by franic drake as rukhs wife and violet kemble cooper as his mother so its ok but just a notch below all the other karlofflugosi movies the plot is just too farfetched for me to swallow still i did like this i give it a 7
