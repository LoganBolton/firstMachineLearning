there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being universals first monster in the seminal classic dracula bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent sadly this last factor would also led him to be typecasted during the 40s in the same way boris karloffs performance in james whales frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was 1934s the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director lambert hillyers mix of horror and science fiction the invisible ray is another of those minor classics they did in those yearsbr br in the invisible ray dr janos rukh boris karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planets past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues dr felix benet bela lugosi and sir francis stevens walter kingsford they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition wont be any beneficial for rukh as during the expedition his wife diane frances drake will fall in love with ronald drake frank lawton an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as hell be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteorbr br written by john colton who previously did the script for werewolf of london the invisible ray had its roots on an original scifi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is there arent exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions guilt and revengebr br a seasoned director of lowbudget bmovies filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources hillyers films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films hillyers movie effectively captures the essence of coltons script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward scifi finally a word must be said about hillyers use of special effects for an extremely lowbudget film they look a lot better than the ones in several amovies of the erabr br as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the films protagonist boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague dr benet bela luogis is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukhs wife frances drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh and beulah bondi as lady arabella as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the castbr br if one judges this movie under todays standards its very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however that would be a mistake as despite its lowbudget it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept its ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr benet as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actorsbr br while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the frankenstein movies nor the elegant suspense of the black cat lambert hillyers the invisible ray is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures catalog of horror films with one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror this mixture of suspense horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela lugosi 810
