this is just about in the same league as the black cat although id give this a 9 rather than a 9 thats praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazingbr br the invisible ray is part horror part drama and certainly part scifi for a movie made in 1936 the scifi elements were a good deal ahead of their time the mixture of horror drama and scifi are a perfect blend while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldnt be betterbr br director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often what im saying is that this film is eerie and well shot the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosis room is a perfect example of the mood its a standout moment in the film which is so sadly missing in todays movies of the genrebr br as with the black cat and island of lost souls i cant understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd when you consider some of the junk thats already been transferred to dvd its that much more puzzlingbr br anyway watch this film if you get the chance when its released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library
