karloff and lugosi  together again this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much its not an allout horror film like the duos previous two hits the black cat and the raven but it is very worthy of boths talents and is a fun film when revisitedbr br the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer a director who mainly made westerns but curiously in these final days of the laemmles reign at universal he found himself helming this and the laemmles final horror film draculas daughter both are crisp cleancut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elementsbr br just as lugosi went wild in the raven much needs to be said of karloffs hamming in the invisible ray the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloffs character rukh acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x that there really isnt much of a change once he starts glowing this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining  hes basically a loony right from the start there isnt any real transformation same here halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind i still enjoyed his performance though just as i did lugosis overthetop antics in the ravenbr br meanwhile lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as rukhs rival in science dr benet lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on  and if he rukh touches anyone the inspector inquires lugosi hesitatingly replies in a way that only lugosi could deliver they die just as lugosi could be so off he could also be more perfect than any actor this is one of those momentsbr br therefore karloff and lugosis interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times however one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one he only had one more chance ninotchkabr br the invisible ray is a fun film and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans it is one of those films that improves on each viewing not because it is a masterpiece but because of the charisma and talent of its stars and how this story complements the darker more horrific pairings they had the special effects by the always innovative john fulton are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman something seldom seen in classic horror films the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesnt scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film a terrific fun film
