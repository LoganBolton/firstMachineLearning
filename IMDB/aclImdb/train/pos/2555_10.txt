the movie wasnt all that great the book is better but the movie wasnt all that bad either it was interesting to say the least the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldnt say i was actually interested in the movie itself janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching they have a few cute scenes that should appeal to the romantics overall id give the movie a 7 or 8 it wasnt bad just a little lacking plot wise
