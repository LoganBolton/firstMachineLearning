and a made for tv movie too this movie was good the acting in it and the plot was just so great this one of the only movies ive seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie but its very easily over lookedbr br antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on four times and it too kicked was great if you ever see this movie come on tv id watch it the effects in this movie were pretty well done i honestly dont know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldnt suck so badbr br watch it its really good no really it is
