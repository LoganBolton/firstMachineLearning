having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after memorial day i finally got to seeing sayonara just this morning in this one marlon brando plays major lloyd ace gruver a generals son whos been raised a certain way being transfered from korea to japan where his girlfriend eileen webster patricia owens conveniently happens to be before leaving he tries to persuade one of his men a joe kelly red buttons out of marrying japanese woman katsumi miyoshi umeki since thats a violation of military fraternization laws with the romance of him and eileen on the outs however ace not only becomes the best man at joe and katsumis wedding he falls for an asian himself after he and captain mike bailey james garner go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer hanaogi miiko taka on stage bailey himself is dating one of the dancers fumikosan reiko kuba eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the kabuki performers nakamura ricardo montalban ill stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning americanasian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end even seeing hispanic montalban playing an oriental isnt too embarrassing though its a good thing his part is short and theres some nice touches of humor like that of brandos head hitting the top of buttons and umekis inside doorway more than once red and miyoshi themselves deserve their oscars especially red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout rookie garner before being cast in his legendary role on tvs marverick is fine in his scenes with brando and miiko taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an antiamerican while ive read there were some changes from james micheners novel i cant imagine director josha logan who had previously adopted another michener work into the broadway musical south pacific and would eventually make that into a movie as well not staying true to the original source he certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the 50s mores that permeated america and japan at the time
