this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen yes i can agree that some parts may seem dated but this does not distract from the film one should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time clearly by the sex in the city standards charlie chaplin was horribly boring however when judged from the prospective of 1925 america he was fantastic likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixedrace love affair american manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures it is a natural next step to such films as gentlemans agreement its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with innumerable lines that one just doesnt forgetbr br however even when taken only as a love story it is terrific although some attack brandos accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization buttons and umeki who both won oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the filmbr br taka the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the films end is equally good of course it doesnt have the mouthsucking spitswapping and worse that exemplifies love in todays movies but that makes it all the better it portrays true love and passion and not just heat if this movie doesnt touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead
