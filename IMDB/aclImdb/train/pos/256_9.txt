due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldnt believe how bad it was i didnt go and see this film at the cinema after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now im not saying it is brilliant but i would venture to say that it is a good movie i enjoyed itbr br people have skulls thicker than neds helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal i dont think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians ned kelly has become a legend legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesnt trust or accept authority a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushrangerbr br so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow australians watch the lighthorseman and you will see what i mean it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers ironically i actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on neds story would dwell and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historiansbr br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market to pay the pills and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of neds spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against peoples expectations and unfortunately missed both targets fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it orlando blooms performance did a lot for the movie too  he really added something i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a changebr br when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime
