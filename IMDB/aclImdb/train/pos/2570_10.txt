well this is probably one of the best movies ive seen and i love it so much that ive memorized most of the script especially the scene in the storage unit when jerry lee breaks wind and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see whos smarter the tag line holds true as well not to mention the acting is great though christine tucci sounds different in a whisper check filmography under csi if you dont know what i mean its too bad that this movie only contained the single issue dooley and jerry lee had to work with it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that zeus and welles had up their sleeve
