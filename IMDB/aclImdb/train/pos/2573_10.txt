when my 14yearold daughter and her friends get together for movie night theres one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k911 the third installment in the highly successful k9 franchise starring everybodys favorite tv dad jim belushibr br folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that its starting to skip no joke but of course youll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliantbr br of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved copdog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesnt measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k9 moviesbr br some naysayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment  directtovideo at that  may not seem like something worth watching youd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality moviebr br i wont give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet  one that will have you howling with laughter its a shame john belushi isnt alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting worldbr br i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party dont forget the puppy chow
