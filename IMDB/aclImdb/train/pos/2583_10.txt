the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie this is a great movie there is no special agency involved in the plot this is the clue this is a private plot built as a private enterprise this is a selfdestructive and a self organized plot as a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot private self Â–organized selfdestructive with no trace at the end anyone can be behind the plot a smart director with some money all can be done just by delegation the director must be just trigger if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered all the actors performances are well done  with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney
