it does come out of left field and really isnt what youre expecting but i love that the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised if you ask me if you havent been tipped off about the mysterious thing that makes these brothers so oddyoure in for a treatbr br the cast is fantastic but not stretching so much that its palpable the special effects come out of nowhere seriously its like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do  then wow and theyre great the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes the editing and sound are very good quality and the twisted story unfolds without clich√©s while none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster the what the hell factor alone makes it a film treasurebr br the people who bash this movie make no sense its one of those oftenoverlooked flicks of the 90s that youve either never heard of or love so much you jump at the mention of its titlebr br im in the latter group
