having enjoyed joyces complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph stricks and fred hainess screenplay given the fabulous complexity of the original text however the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone naturalism and levity of the bookbr br it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film i imagine the latter would seem disjointed with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plotbr br its amazing to see how filthy the film is given that it was shot in dublin in 1967 the irish film censors only finally unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club the irish film theatre in the late 1970s joyces eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922  they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967br br it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s respected players all daring to utter and enact joyces hugely transgressive text with such gustobr br bravo
