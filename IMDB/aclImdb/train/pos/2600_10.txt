at the height of the celebrity big brother racism row in 2007  involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody  i condemned on an internet forum those cbb fans who praised the show after years of bashing racist 70s sitcoms such as curry  chips  love thy neighbour i thought they were being hypocritical and said so it aint half hot mum was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blackedup well yes but michael bates had lived in india as a boy and spoke urdu fluently the shows detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer rangi ram the noted indian character actor renu setna said in a 1995 documentary perry  croft the sitcoms that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role but added no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates indeedbr br mum was perry and crofts companion show to dads army also set in wartime the sedate english town of walmingtononsea had been replaced by the hot steamy jungles of india in particularly a place called deolali where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them bombadier solomons  george layton his first sitcom role since doctor in charge  camp gunner gloria beaumont  melvyn hayes  diminutive gunner lofty sugden lah dedah gunner graham  john clegg  and gunner parkins  the late christopher mitchell  presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeantmajor williams  the brilliant windsor davies  who regarded them all as poofs his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying  though he was nice to parkins whom he thought was his illegitimate son  then there was everso english colonel reynolds  donald hewlett  and dimwitted captain ashwood  michael knowles  rangi was like a wise old sage beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british his friends were the teamaking char wallah  the late dino shafeek who went on to mind your language  and the rope pulling punka wallah  babar bhatti  so real indians featured in the show  another point its detractors ignore shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as vocal interruptions  similar to the 40s songs used as incidental music on dads army  each edition closed with him warbling land of hope  glory only to be silenced by a shut up from williams the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek tavernerbr br though never quite equalling dads army in the publics affections mum nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons in 1975 davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut whispering grass they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts entitled  what else  sing loftybr br the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer rather than recast the role of rangi the writers just let him be quietly forgotten when george layton left the character of gloria took his place as bombadier providing another source of comedybr br the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty the char wallah watching them go with great sadness  as did viewers br br repeats have been few and far between  mainly on uk gold  all because of its socalled dodgy reputation this is strange for one thing the show was not specifically about racism if a white man blackedup is so wrong why does david leans 1984 film a passage to india still get shown on television  it featured alec guinness as an indian and won two oscars  it was derived from jimmy perrys own experiences some characters were based on real people  the sergeantmajor really did refer to his men as poofs  i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right sanitizing the past no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences is fundamentally dishonest mum was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this thank heavens for dvds i say time to stop this review as williams would say ill have no gossiping in this jungle
