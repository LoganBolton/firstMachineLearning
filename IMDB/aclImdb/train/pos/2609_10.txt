im writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and i am still reeling from the impact wildside has had on mebr br it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded but it took it further and didnt stray from the realism of the streets often portraying life events and characters down to a tbr br i am sorely missing this series instead we have are given the stupid underbelly which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of americanesquire garbagebr br wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series the acting was agrade and its a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscuritybr br i dont want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd not the first three give this series the ending it deserves
