this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here  and for my money anywhere its raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesnt shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various orbitsbr br this show ran for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show didnt sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like fawlty towers we will be able to revere this as a limitedlength series of uniformly high quality
