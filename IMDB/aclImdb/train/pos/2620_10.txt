what a pleasant surprise a disney dtv direct to video sequel thats actually good the lion king 1 12 is a comedy affair that involves everyones favorite meerkat and warthog timon and pumbaa it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments until timon complains that were not here yet after fighting over the remote timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience their story they start the new movie and the laughs beginbr br to be honest i was losing hope in disney most of their directtovideo fare has been aggressively awful with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original 1 12 decides to try something different it tells the original story from a new point of view okay it adds some stuff like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met but its an interesting concept nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie theres also some neat movie parodies including one scene that simultaneously spoofs the good the bad and the ugly and cool hand luke and the script is filled with funny memorable linesbr br added to the cast are julie kavner the simpsons as timons worrywart mom and jerry stiller as timons slightly crazy uncle max matthew broderick shows up as simba and his teen scene reminded me of ferris bueller everyone does well especially robert guillame is that how you spell it as rafiki who exudes more and more yodaspeak in this movie timon comments on this several timesbr br the lion king 1 12 is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation 1010
