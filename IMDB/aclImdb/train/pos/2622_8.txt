everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else br br any way i havent seen anything like this before so it was crazy of course thats a good thing it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one like chicken little the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying twas beauty who killed the beast war of the worlds scene and more walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema br br however some parts dont fit like in the original lion king werent timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar in this movie they are not they were fighting the hyenas backstage thers more the reason being why pumbaa isnt so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also its just timon timon timon anybody realise that only timonns story was told whereas pumbaa only had flashbacksbr br but apart from that  its great
