lion king 1 12 is the funniest nontheatrical release from disney i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years i remember first time i saw it i didnt had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining moviebr br is it better than simbas pride in many ways yes though simbas pride wasnt exactly bad it did suffer some problems lack of an good script and bad characterizations which made impact of what otherwise a okay filmbr br anyway its nice to see timon and pumbaas personalities blossom again in the way that we or certainly me loved about them in this film in simbas pride they were completely annoying and i didnt liked the timon and pumbaa series neitherbr br this film could easily have been a stupid one but fortunately the filmmakers didnt took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own the score is quite good there are two new songs which are catchy and two new characters timons mom voiced by recognizable marge simpsons julie kavner and uncle max which are enjoyable the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesnt feel out of place which it could have easily done especially in comediesbr br but is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me yes there is although they fortunately doesnt impact too much but ill mention them 1 many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one personally it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new onesbr br 2 during the climax some of the jokes becomes lamebr br 3 storywise this is timons story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simbas it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at timesbr br but hey those details doesnt impact this otherwise amusing movie it is the only really acceptable disney sequel which should be in every movie collection
