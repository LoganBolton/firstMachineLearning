finally timon and pumbaa in their own filmbr br the lion king 1 12 hakuna matata is an irreverent new take on a classic tale which classic tale you ask why the lion king of coursebr br yep if theres one thing that disney is never short of its narcissismbr br but that doesnt mean that this isnt a good film its basically the events of the lion king as told from timon and pumbaas perspective and its because of this that youll have to know the story of the lion king by heart to see where theyre coming frombr br anyway at one level i was watching this and thinking oh my god this is so lame and on another level i was having a ball much of the humour is predictable  i mean when pumbaa makes up two beds a big one for himself and a small one for timon within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one but that doesnt stop it from being hilarious which imo is hakuna matata in a nutshell its not what happens its howbr br and a note of warning there are also some fart jokes seriously did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage but as fart jokes go these are especially good and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseurbr br the returning voice talent is great im kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return what with most of them only having two or three lines if theyre lucky whoopi goldberg is particularly welcomebr br the music is also great from digga tunnah at the start to thats all i need an adaption of warthog rhapsody a song that was cut from the lion king and is frankly much improved in this incarnation the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoeverbr br in the end timon and pumbaa are awesome characters and while it may be argued that hakuna matata is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it its rare to find characters that you just want to spend time withbr br am i starting to sound creepybr br either way the lion king 1 12 is great if youve seen the lion king far too many times especially if you are right now thinking dont be silly theres no such thing as seeing the lion king too many times
