spoilers spoilersbr br this movie the divers is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine ive got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part knowing that nordic films arent always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very scepticalbr br upon viewing i was  surprisedbr br i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50s and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and its all goodbr br as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitlesbr br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at its worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research its all goodbr br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war its a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect its a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i52 its god a good design and makes a nice wreckbr br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i cant remember its summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a mariner of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again its all goodbr br plotwise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and its crew one of the visitors a man in his 50s has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back the islands senior citizens all remember when a german uboat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken uboat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever foundbr br what to expectbr br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprisebr br  warning  spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem its not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtlebr br overall  really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it isnt a hollywood movie with unlimited resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while yes a childs story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nicebr br medusa 2001br br
