my take a funny take on the lion king posing as a sequel surprisingly amusing br br surprisingly lion king 1 12 is actually another funny straighttovideo thats worth a theatrical treatment i dont see why disney released this straight to video and release crappy movies like chicken little and return to neverland theatrically those movies are better off seen in the video stores in the new releases area rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theatersbr br this one is merely a spoof of the first film although the events in simbas pride hasnt taken place yet on timon voiced by nathan lane and pumbaas voiced by ernie sabella point of view we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film original voices from the first film like matthew broderick woopie goldberg cheeche martin and robert guillaume return to their voicing roles from the first film while julie kavner and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as timons mom and grumpy unclebr br so doesnt this sound fun maybe not now but go watch it for yourself the fact that its not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable its kinda like mst3000 with timon and pumbaabr br video movie rating 12 out of 5
