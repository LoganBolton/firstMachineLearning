this is a straighttovideo movie so it should go without saying that its not going to rival the first lion king but that said this was downright goodbr br my kids loved this but thats a given they love anything thats a cartoon the big shock was that i liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes had lots of rather creative tieins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being risqu√© like in shrek do you think hes compensating for somethingbr br a special note on the fart jokes i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noisesimagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setuppunchlineetc and were almost in good taste id like my kids to think that theres more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regardsbr br hmm what else the music was soso not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids no painfully corny moments which was a blessing for me a little action but nothing too scary the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares not sure a g rating was appropriate for that onebr br all in all id say this is a great movie for kids of any age one thats 100 safe to let them watch i try not to be overly sensitive but ive had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kidappropriate than expected  but youre safe to leave the room during this one id say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too
