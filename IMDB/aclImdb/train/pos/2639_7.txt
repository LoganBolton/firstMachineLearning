being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the directtovideo movies as i have mixed feelings of them as wellbr br while watching the lion king 1½ i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself embracing the latterbr br the lion king 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon  pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameosbr br i could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king 1 i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i dont think many kids are really concerned about disneys profit margin on directtovideo moviesbr br however i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie im just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract mebr br as for the music it wasnt too bad but dont expect any classics to come from this movie at least lk2 had the nice ballad love will find a way as for the voicework it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner best known as marge simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc 2 of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of funbr br so all in all the lion king 1½ isnt a perfect movie but its cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is  a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends perspectivesbr br my imdb rating 710 my yahoo grade b good
