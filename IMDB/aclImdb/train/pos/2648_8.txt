really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace via drug addiction and later redemption one brother a selfproclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent manchild the other brother is a hardworking future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his familys expectations for both children not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about id recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love
