why cant more directors these days create horror movies like the shining theres an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved onceandforall with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all timebr br so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholsonand his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the offseason the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i meanbr br this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary its some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubricks movies 2001 a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesnt disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without itbr br finally i must comment on nicholsons legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is topnotch acting that must be seen to believebr br there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one rip stanley
