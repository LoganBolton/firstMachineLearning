the shining is a weird example of adaptation it has very little in common with the source novel written by stephen king yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror masters work this is due to two factors stanley kubricks masterful direction and jack nicholsons chilly actingbr br nicholson plays jack torrance a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family jack his wife wendy shelley duvall and their fiveyear old son danny danny lloyd the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that somethings wrong he has been told by the cook dick o hallorann scatman crothers that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy the titular shining which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny even though he is quite capable of resisting them that is not jacks case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wifes affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to breakbr br the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasnt hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths king criticized the director for changing most of the story omitting most of the jackdanny subplot merely hinted at in the film that led to the books emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the omission was actually necessary the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme kubrick one of the most famous analysts of human decay never had a soft spot for what he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical unbalance that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot dannys encounter with two ghostly twins being the best examplebr br another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writers opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story now it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that martin sheen kings ideal choice for the role probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholsons from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal heres johnny scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isnt bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoos nest star as for duvall and lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens the omens damien and haley joel osment as cinemas great horror child icons one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart blonde and beautiful and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered a back in 1980 the scream queen clich√© wasnt one yet b rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the bookmovie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendys eyesbr br irvine welsh the author of trainspotting once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work and he should know given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen yet that doesnt mean the movie is necessarily bad the shining proves said point to perfection very little from the novel approximately 5 is included in the film but in kubrick and nichlolsons hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the genres current poor form
