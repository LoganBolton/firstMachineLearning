at times this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film while carpenters film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick kubricks is more artistic more thoughtprovoking and probably scarier its one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it i try not to compare it to the book  which ive only read once a number of years ago and which scared me to death  because the two dont have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously its almost as if kubrick was banking on peoples love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening and it that way its certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made as well as one of the greatest horror filmsbr br what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares not the blood and gore not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time its the destruction of jack torrence some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role saying that its too obvious that hes going to go crazy in the film given his past roles and his appearance i disagree we know hes going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and jacks appearance only furthers this notion but its the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared hes calm quiet patient he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family and with a wife and son as irritating as his its a small wonder that he manages to do so but once he gets to the overlook he changes he becomes irritable angry on edge the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing and he utterly loses it telling her to leave him the f alone this is the first fbomb dropped in the film and its a shock to the system from then on all bets are offbr br another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film were never really sure if what were seeing is actually happening many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost theres a mirror present showing that he may as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never sees anything until the films climax until she is given a tour of the hotels many ghostly inhabitants but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny connects with the place almost immediately his psychic powers are not in question  how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness its easy to claim that jack merely loses it being trapped in a hotel with his family and wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of danny it appears that his body is taken over by tony but how do we know for sure none of these characters are reliable witnesses hallorann probably would be and he warns of the dangers in 237 but hes killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel and that final shot has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema has jack really been there before or was his body merely absorbed into the hotel when talking about the acting in this film any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose to give jacks character more of a reason to snap  and danny lloyd is no better but jack is a powerhouse part method part improvisation hes simultaneously terrifying and appealing for better or for worse hes the character with whom we identify with not the annoying kid or nagging wife we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be able to do whatever we want who cares if its haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubricks long takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the use of colour mirrors long hallways and every other motif only heightens this and dont even get me started on that score i dont know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the entire film itselfbr br i know king doesnt like this film but kings input on cinema is nothing to brag about as great of a novel writer he may be his screenplays are terrible and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doesnt need to be and it really shouldnt part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesnt have the book to fall back on theres no reassuring source material kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more if only for that this is one of the most innovative films in any genre and its got everything else on top of that
