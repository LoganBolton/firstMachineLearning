the shining starts with jack torrance jack nicholson driving to an isolated hotel named the overlook situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with its manager stuart ullman barry nelson about becoming the winter caretaker ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in together with his wife wendy shelley duvall  young son danny danny lloyd jack moves into the hotel  at first everything seems fine its a beautiful hotel absolutely huge  whatever they need is at their disposal however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide  danny has the ability to shine which means he has psychic powers that let him see  hear things ordinary people cant as the days weeks  months begin to pass jack become more  more insane danny keeps seeing things  people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesnt have a clue whats happening to her family as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses itbr br this english production was cowritten coproduced  directed by stanley kubrick  is a fine horror film it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions  the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length the script by kubrick  diane johnson is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i cant compare them goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film there are very few characters in the shining with jack wendy  danny the only ones that really matter since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them become involved with them  what they go through the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didnt feel that long  keeps you interested throughout on the negative side i dont think the reasoning behind jack going crazy  wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me  i dont know if i missed something but that ending didnt make any sense to me whatsoever im still trying to work out what that picture is all about there is very little in the way of violence or gore a couple of rotten zombie ghosts  someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesnt need to rely on blood  special effects as it has a gripping story with a budget of about 19000000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic freeflowing  smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the characters around the maze of corridors the sets look absolutely real  instead of clich√©d old haunted house themes like dark corners basements  cobwebs kubrick brings things right uptodate with brightly lit corridors massive open expansive spaces  a modern decor well 80s modern just check that red toilet out the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying  nicholson seems crazy from the very start the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although im not sure id watch it again anytime soon for those looking for explosions  fancy special effects you will be disappointed for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you well worth a watch in my humble opinion
