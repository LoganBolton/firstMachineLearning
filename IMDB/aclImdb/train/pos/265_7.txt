a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered its up to poirot to bring a killer to justicebr br hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christies original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirots ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchets poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jacksons inspector japp and pauline morans miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel its a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock titlebr br i realized while rewatching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christies work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
