when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubricks other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would beat times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldnt take my eyes of the screen still theres something very disturbing about everything in the film now some people dont like kubricks version of the shining since it doesnt entirely follow stephen kings book but in my opinion both kubricks versionthe miniseries and the book are all greatjack nicholson gives an awesome performanceif you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining
