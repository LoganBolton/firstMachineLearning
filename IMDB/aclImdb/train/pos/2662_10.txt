 spoilers  br br before i begin this let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the authorized version of this movie remade by stephen king himself in 1997br br both advantages made me appreciate this version of the shining all the morebr br also let me say that ive read mr kings book the shining on many occasions over the years and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work stanley kubricks retelling of this story is far more compelling  and scarybr br kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay itself he acquired the title magus beyond question kubricks genius is like magic the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut 1999 full metal jacket 1987 barry lyndon 1975 a clockwork orange 1971 2001 a space odyssey 1968 spartacus 1960 and many morebr br the torrences jack wendy his wife and danny their son are living in the overlook hotel for the winter jack has been hired as the caretaker it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow until spring when the overlook reopens its doors it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snowfilled summer getawaybr br the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging it lent to the atmosphere by having a dark yet at the same time welcoming atmosphere itself the furnishings and furniture was all period late 70s  early 80s and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the worldbr br the introduction of wendy and dannys characters was a stroke of genius you get the whole story of their past dannys imaginary friend tony and the story of jacks alcoholism all rolled into this nice neat introductory scene there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie obviously kubrick saw that from the beginningbr br closing day again the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel this time with family in tow the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchangebr br the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking even as the staff is moving things out you get a chance to see the majestic fire places the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings dormants and crown moldings in the architecture they did a good job pink and gold are my favorite colors wendy torrence even the staff wing is well designed and beautifully builtbr br the maze was a magnificent touch reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center seeing wendy and danny entering its a magickal moment one that tells you right away there are heavy energies in that house theres something seriously wrong already starting i wouldnt want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out the hotel managerbr br scatman cruthers as dick halloran was genuine and open in his performance his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful you could actually believe you were there in the hotel taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and doc his explanation of the shining to danny was very well delivered as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel it was believable and sincerebr br the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself with the mountains looming behind the cold air swirling about mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie it also marks the halfwaytohell point so to speak the turning point in the moviebr br shelley duvalls portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful so what if she also played olive oyl it just shows her marvelous diversity honestly before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980 i said what olive oyl lol popeye was also released in 1980 but i took that back as soon as the movie started shes brilliant in this fiends opinion this is her best performance to date although i did love her in steve martins roxanne 1987br br once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you the viewer need to be in possession the torrences past dannys broken arm tony the history of the hotel itself the fact that danny is not mental but rather clairvoyant instead and the general layout of the hotel all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences the movie never stops scaring youbr br the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker delbert grady the girls having appeared several times to danny first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel were icons with which danny could identify and of which he was afraid at the same time they were haunting and haunted themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed in a rather graphic and material waybr br kubricks tony was written as an attendant spirit like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father he wasthe little boy who lives in my mouth he would manifest in the end of dannys finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny not like in the book i realize where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy trying to save his father kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony took  danny  over the idea of dannys older self projecting back to his younger self isntscarybr br the woman in the shower scene done by lia beldan about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before or since as the younger woman and billie gibson who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting it was dramatic and frightening abhorrent and scary when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and realbr br jack quickly embarks on his trek from the jonesing alcoholic to a certifiable insane person the degradation of his characters mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick jacks instant friendship with lloyd the bartender as only alcoholics wouldbe mental patients and drug addicts do portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him namely alcohol hair of the dog that bit me jack torrence in jacks case its bourbon on the rocks at no charge to jack orders from the house lloyd the bartender nice play on wordsbr br when wendy finds jacks screenplay is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styleswhen he asks from the shadows how do you like it and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her handis so poignant its the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation ishow messed up jack is its very scary dramatic and delivers a strong presence that coupled with dannys visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood imposed over the scene between jack and wendy and with the confrontational ending to this scene make this possibly the strongest scene of the moviebr br the redrum scene wow what do i say what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young troubled son standing over them with a huge knife talking in that freaky little voice exclaiming redrum over and over even if it had no meaning it would still be as scary as the 7th level of hell it was something everyone could and has remembered speaking of memorable scenesbr br nicholsons final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history his adlibbed line heeeeeres johnny was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror it also goes down in horror movie historybr br the ending kubricks ending was perfection i felt it ended beautifully no smarm no platitudinous whining no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie just epitomized perfection thats all ill say on the subject of the endingbr br who cares what was taken out look what kubrick put in rent it watch it buy it its a classic in the horror genre and for good reason it rawksbr br me being me  take this movie and sitck it in your stephen king collection and take the 1997 authorized version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section thats where it belongs  this movie rates a 998 from the fiend
