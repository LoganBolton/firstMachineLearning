i was never a big fan of horror movies they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon it was wellacted and had a great story but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubricks the shining quite possibly the scariest movie everbr br the movie follows a writer jack nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writers block after months of solitude and silence however jack becomes a grumpy and later violent is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him madbr br one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes the hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty it is also eerily calm when jacks son is riding his bike through the barren hallways jack nicholsons performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walkin refrigeratorbr br the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project it may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie 810
