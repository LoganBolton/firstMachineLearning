lorna greenjanine reynaudis a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon its quite possible that through a form of hypnotic suggestion someonea possible task master pulling her strings like a puppetis guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that lovemaking is about to begin after the murders within her fantasies are committed lorna awakens bewildered often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in realitybr br if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco id say its elegant  difficult by now youve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career as far as filmmaking style and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience and as you read from the reaction of the user comments heresome like this decision others find the style labouring dull and bewildering ill be the first to admit that the film is over my head but even franco himself when quizzed by critics who watched succubus admitted that he didnt even understand the film and he directed it some might say that succubus was merely a precursor to his more admired work venus in furs considered his masterwork by francofaithful because it also adopts the surreal dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesnt truly know whether heshe is experiencing something real or imagined in a sense like the protagonist we are experiencing the same type of confusioncertainly succubus is unconventional filmmaking where we arent given the keys to what is exactly going on and a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesnt help matters succubus is also populated by beatnik types and poetspeak cormans film a bucket of blood poked fun at my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh partyquite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually great locations and jazz scorei liked this film myself although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna a wee bit drunk writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindigequally wastedrush her in an embrace of kisses
