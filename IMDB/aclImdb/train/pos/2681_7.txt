as you probably already know jess franco is one prolific guy hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films many of which are crap however he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation succubus isnt his best work thats either the diabolical dr z or vampyros lesbos but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog he combines the erotic alternating between showing fullfrontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination and the surreal seamlessly this is a very dreamlike film full of great atmosphere i particularly liked the constant namedropping despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious its amusing to hear all of francos influencesbr br still there are many users who dont like succubus and i can see where theyre coming from its leisurely paced but i can deal with that more problematic is the incoherency the script here was obviously rushed and within five minutes into the film i had absolutely no idea what was going on and it never really came together from that point on those who want some substance with their style look elsewhere also if its a horror film it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful still i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that i didnt really mind these major flaws all too much 710
