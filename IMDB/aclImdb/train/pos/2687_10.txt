no other movie has made me feel like this before and i dont feel bad like i dont want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie 9 months nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this  the reason i say  is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just cant seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather no movie has ever done this to me before never in my life have i wanted cauliflower milk and baguettes this much thank you  edbr br uh clears throat no words no thoughts i dont know i truly dont know  cait
