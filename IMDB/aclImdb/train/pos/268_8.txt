i loved dedee pfeiffer is that spelled right in cybil havent seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for surebr br just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and ill watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly
