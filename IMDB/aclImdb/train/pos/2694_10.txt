garde à vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the subplots it contains if youre not used to french wordy films based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action dont even try to watch it youll only obtain boredom to death and reassured opinion that french movies are not for youbr br garde à vue is a wordy film essentially based upon dialogs written by audiard by the wayand it cruelly cuts the veil of appearancesbr br why does maître martineau serrault prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth  because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8years sexual relation his wife knows it shes jealous of it and he prefers to be executed in 1980 in france there was still death penaltyrather than unveiling the sole pure and innocent aspect of his pitiful life
