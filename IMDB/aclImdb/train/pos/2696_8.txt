police investigations murder suspicion we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere however most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones yet it occurs that these people may easily be misled a film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years oldit is garde a vue a unique movie by claude millerbr br is there much of the action not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time but the way they are executed is the movies great plus jerome charles martinaud michel serrault is being investigated by inspector gallien lino ventura and insector belmont guy marchand its a new years eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last in other words more quoted from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is to achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both partiesbr br some people criticize the script for being too wordy yet i would ask them what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk this wordiness touches the very roots of the genre in no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an observer involved moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told not too much and not too little of them  just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting the most memorable flashbacks for me are when chantal romy schneider martinauds wife talks about one lovely christmas but these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach it all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace and since i saw garde a vue i always mention this film as one of the defenders of french cinema against accusations of mess and chaos br br but those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still wont find the content and its execution satisfactory yet garde a vue is worth seeing also for such people why for the sake of performances but here dont expect me to praise foremost romy schneider garde a vue is not romy schneider vehicle she does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child she credibly portrays a person who is calm concrete who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly melancholic role of elsa in la passante de sans souci it is still acted however romy schneider does not have much time on screen practically she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes symbolically with the new year at midnight her role is a purely supporting one who really rocks is lino ventura he is the middle aged inspector antoine gallien who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are missiles towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate he is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of womens psyche he is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service finally he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on new years eve michel serrault also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie but thumbs up for mr ventura brilliantbr br as far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed the entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which i have not mentioned before gorgeous music for me the talk of chantal and inspector gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment you are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you seebr br garde a vue is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances new year has turned andis it now easier to open the door youll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by claude miller 810
