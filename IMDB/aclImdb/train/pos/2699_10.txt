there are other reviews here so i dont need to say how great it is or what its aboutmy point is i heard about this movie ages ago before it was shown i cant even remember how i just know it was through the internet the distributors went under before it ever hit for months i moped and complained please note that on this page theres a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazoncom in germany you can use alta vistas babelfish to translate i know its pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and theres a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning thats also been dubbed in german but as hilarious and campy as this film is it really only makes it funnier if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions its so worth it it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the us from germany trust me it might seem like a lot to spend on a film but if youre into corny bflicks youll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends
