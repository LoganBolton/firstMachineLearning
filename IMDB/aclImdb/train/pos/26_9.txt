when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many childrens musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very welldone which isnt surprising considering the cast christopher walken is very catlike and doesnt need stupid makeup or a cat costume for the viewer to believe hes a cat transformed to a human and jason connerys so cute as the shy and awkward millers son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera this is a really fun enjoyable featurelength movie where unlike most fairytales the characters are given personalities some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend hes drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as its all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table hes a pretty good dancer too and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a millers daughter id recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it wont drive adults up the wall
