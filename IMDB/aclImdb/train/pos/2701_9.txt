this 1998 film was based on a script by the late edward d wood a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief while much of woods work was quirky lowbudget entries into various genrefilm traditions his first released feature glen or glenda was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avantgarde techniques i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood the experimenter although this film is a comedy a nightmarish comedy however while the crossdressing theme of glen or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world and i cant really compare that world with anything else the technical side of the filmproduction design sound design music scoring photography etcis groundbreaking on any number of levels in particular although the film has no dialogue there is sound of all kinds and also language but youll have to see how its done yourself as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout the glen or glendaesque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum the whole film is played at a hysterical feverpitch and billy zane provides an amazing tourdeforce performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is in a just world he would have been given some award for this performance he even looks like ed wood and as played by zane this character is at various timesfunny sleazy tragic sympathetic and anonymoussometimes simultaneously what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release only playing a few festivals right now its only available on video in germany in fact my copy is from a german sourcethe excerpts from woods screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german although the newspaper headlines that great lowbudget technique of giving plot elements especially those that would be too expensive to film via newspaper headlines is used here in the wood traditionthat zane sees are in english i think that this film could have gotten a wordofmouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion and if played off city by city slowing on the artfilm circuit it could have done well in fact if the legal issues can be resolved id like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release especially a midnight cult release this is a classic waiting to be discoveredbr br did i understand every scene no but i felt every scene emotionally did everything work in the film perhaps not ive only seen it twice and the first time i saw it i was interruped a number of times however with all the assemblyline junk playing the multiplexes and with so much alternative film being fetishistic or pretentious shotonvideo filmschool rejects we need actual hollywoodmade experimentation like this the recent bob dylan film masked and anonymous took similar chances as did something like steven soderberghs full frontal this film could find an audience much larger than either of those if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing see if it has ever been released on video you will not be bored invite some friends overmake it a party play the amazing soundtrack loud i have a feeling that wherever he is in the afterlife ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film woods probably also laughing that just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making
