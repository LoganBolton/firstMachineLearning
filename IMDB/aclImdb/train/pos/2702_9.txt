ok so i know of this movie because of a friend of mines in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming so from a personal standpoint i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem if you dig at all on info regarding this movie youll find its mired in legal troubles even over 7 years after being filmed so if you are at all like me  then youll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy my source ebay about 15 but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail it was a very rough grainy copy of a screener only release complete with annoying top mini timecode but alas i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you from what i have gleaned its been released on dvd in germany  now spain with that good luck  happy searchingbidding the scoresndtrk is worth it alone very eclectic and varied somethinbg rare these days imho in film  i think that will be my next sndtrkscore to locate but i digress br br now onto the review the film opens as billy zanes character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in he steals her clothes even shoes and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bankloan shop but after escaping with the loot well i guess this is where the plot begins  he inadvertently looses it after perpetrating several campy overthetop crimes  dalliances to various a to clist celebs to locate the money he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral  i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan officebank and  even with 1950s police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout  he never gets seen or nabbed he sees daily newspapers reporting his crimes this i liked because it gave the thin plot an extension after all its a movie see fiction  director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to 1 bring woods vision to fruition and 2 give it an updated feel yet have shots of authentic 50s police cars intertwined with ahh local la99 stores  so well hence my 9 rating if the period and props were authentic  i would have given it a 10 now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i wont spoil it for anyone but lets just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it to me it had promise action and comedy  all up till the end sowith all that said locate a copy at your own discretionbr br just realize that as there is no dialouge except for some narration and singing this may be up your alley  maybe not but i definitely think its worth a watch the actors all do fine performances and its only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction  then i would say by all means check this film out for its not like anything these studios put out these days or will in the future too i am sure
