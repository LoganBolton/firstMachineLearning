i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad its good type of viewing however i really like this film for its fun factor and  believe it or not  its innovationbr br the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements billy zane moves with incredible expression see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected starsbr br you may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars highly reccomended
