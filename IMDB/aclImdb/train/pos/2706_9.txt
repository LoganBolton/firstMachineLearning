i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels i also met the director of the film i heard that ed wood wrote the story in 10 years im sure he thought his would be his masterpiece  his triumphbr br well if you take the film seriously like mr wood did it is really one of the worst films you will ever see and this is cool the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesnt even try to be a decent filmbr br this makes the film very very good the script is filled with nihilism and anarchism  a lot of black humour billy zanes role is absolutely excellent you see this is either high artor low rubbishbr br
