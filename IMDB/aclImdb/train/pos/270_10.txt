i have to say seventeen  missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mysterybr br dedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a socalled graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mothers wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearancebr br seventeen  missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 1010
