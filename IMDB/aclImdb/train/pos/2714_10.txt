this was one of those wonderful rare moments in tv that i wished id captured forever on vhs wont it ever air again br br it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i cant have not even on ebay br br so having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the 80s put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it sobbr br it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could
