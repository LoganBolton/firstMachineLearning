i saw this film after watching capote and infamous it is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie the reporter is straight the protagonists are more beatniks than gaybr br the film starts slowly but on reviewing it a second time we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writerdirector brooks createsbr br notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and tobekilled are linked cutter on the phone is matchedcut to perry on the phone cutter washing his face is matchedcut to perry washing his face only perrys looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in las vegas to empty chairs this failurefantasy matches the failurefantasy that perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in alaska only to find it perpetually emptybr br dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants dont know that that theyre going to die we cut to the cluttersbr br perry talks his dream about a yellow bird taller than jesus who attacks the nuns who have persecuted them the nuns begged for mercy he tells us but the bird slaughtered them anyway the bird lifted perry to paradise strangely perry says that he has an aversion to nuns god and religion this echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whombr br the director puts in all sorts of whatifs and onlyifsbr br nancy cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house she is holding a horse perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on nancy cant sleep over at her friends house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner the decision seals her fatebr br perry talks of bogart in treasure of sierra madre but it is another bogart picture beat the devil which truman capote cowrote where a fictional treasure hunt is the mcguffin but dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing dick wants the hard cash the 10000 he thinks is in the clutters safe which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as perrys mexican treasurebr br cut to herb clutter signing a 40000 life insurance policy hes thinking about mortality at the moment ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours the insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hoursbr br dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them later in fact it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were rememberedbr br there was one witness the detective keeps telling dick later but was that witness the jailhouse friend dick perry truman capote or god the viewer becomes the witness after watching the moviebr br fascinating film
