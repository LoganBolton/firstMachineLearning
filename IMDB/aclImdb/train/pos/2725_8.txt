in cold blood adapted by director richard brooks from truman capotes famous novel deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals the film excels as a character study of the killers particularly triggerman perry smith robert blakebr br the cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease robert blake and scott wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities they play off of each other effortlessly while blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his characters idiosyncrasies the rest of the cast is merely average and isnt worth remarking onbr br richard brooks received oscar nominations for both his script and his direction in my opinion both were excellent though the script does miscalculate with some illadvised narration in the late stages the oscarnominated cinematography by conrad hall is also topnotch as is the editing also worthy of note is the jazzy score by quincy jones which secured the last of the films four oscar nominationsbr br unlike so many other crime films this one doesnt glamorize violence brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual hollywood approach i recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled
