one of the best truecrime movies ever made and very faithful to truman capotes book which invented the truecrime novel genre haunting quincy jones musical score and terrific acting by scott wilson and robert blake as dick and perry the killers why wilson didnt go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to mebr br the black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch the recreation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off the movie was filmed in the actual clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders the movie has a very documentary feelbesides the scenes at the actual clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to nancy clutters beloved horse babe is even in the movie will geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie br br this is a solid movie scary every time you see it
