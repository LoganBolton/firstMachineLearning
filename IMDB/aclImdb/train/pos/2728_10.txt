simply one of the best ever richard brooks adaptation of truman capotes nonfiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an oscar a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddlymatched killers this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and wasnt even nominated for best picture while dr doolittle was go figure br br although you dont get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the painstaking process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey there are simply no flaws in this one 10 out of 10 best performance  scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended
