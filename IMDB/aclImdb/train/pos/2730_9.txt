i saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing then as im sure it would still be it was the first part of 68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across america and there had recently been a massmurder in my hometown where i saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage the freshness of that closetohome event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience it really brought to life the excellent acting of robert blake and scott wilson i was familiar with the novel based on the true event by truman capote and the screenplay and direction by richard brooks wove the event and trumans interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation music from quincy jones effectively scores its story ive only seen this a couple times since it was too real almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers i would give this a 90 of a possible 10 society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche
