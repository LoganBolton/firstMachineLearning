the movie was gripping from start to finish and its bw photography of the american heartland is stunning we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face in the end we follow them up the stairway to their final moment br br the two criminals performed by robert blake and scott wilson as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else evil even the most vile is part of the human condition these two delusional men kill an entire family looking for a safe that isnt there once on the run they start writing bad cheques carving out a trail for the authoritiesbr br there are many fine supporting actors i like john forsyth as the detective on the case alvin dewey also will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorneybr br i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through having only caught it in short snatches i did finally get to it after buying the dvd the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seenbr br dont miss this brilliant movie to me this is what great filmmaking is all about
