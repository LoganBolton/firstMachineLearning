i havent seen this in over 20yrs but i still remember things about itbr br this film could not have been made in color the stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the 1950s what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap i dont think i could watch that againonce is plenty its like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as wellbr br some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in 179495 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
