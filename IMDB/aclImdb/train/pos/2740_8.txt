tremendous blackandwhite nighttime cinematography and plenty of it highlights this supposedlytrue life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two menbr br the story was written by truman capote so you get the very liberal antideath penalty message at the end of the film which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case robert blake and scott wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family br br despite the annoying slant at the end this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this it makes me wish more modernday films were made in blackandwhite see it on dvdbr br blake wilson john forsythe jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 shortly after blake in real life was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife one cant help but look at blake and this film differently after that
