i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie longtime fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick its a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but then most movies these days arent exactly original but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis however too much of the plot takes place offscreen  like motivation prior behaviors good times and bad times  and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ie me the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i cant say that i cared much about any of the characters that being said it was what it was  a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon  and i still like nick
