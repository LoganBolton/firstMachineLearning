i picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics quotes on the back of the box im not big into foreign films and didnt know what to expect i dont really care for subtitles either but i absolutely loved it it has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly id recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles this one makes it worth the effort
