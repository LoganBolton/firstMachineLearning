the number of times ive had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie this movie has some kliches but i really dont care i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message we all know it in our hearts but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all its forms its only when we love that were truly alive i know how sentimental i sound and i promise im not usually like that im quite a cynic this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see
