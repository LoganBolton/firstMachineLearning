people tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people i dont see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people jaco van dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction daniel auteuil and pascal duquenne work perfectly together with duquenne basically playing himself the film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isnt simply content to go over what was seen in rain man the ending is rather depressing but it doesnt ruin the wonderful story that has come beforebr br 78 out of 10
