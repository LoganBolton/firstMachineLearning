ive always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david the monarch with a wandering eyebr br a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film adultery redemption sin punishment and generally what god expects from his followersbr br when youre a king even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us king david has many wives including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul davids predecessor but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening turns out shes as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women uriah is one of davids army captains david sends for bathsheba and him being the king she comes a runnin because shes had her eye on him toobr br what happens an affair a pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought disease and pestilencebr br the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death david shows weakness in his previous actions but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the filmbr br my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if youre wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until theyre both conqueredbr br susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle i liked kieron moores performance as a brave and rather stupid horses rear br br no one can lay the law down like raymond massey his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films same intensity br br so when his own law called for death why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne maybe it was the fact he just didnt want to train a third guy for the job hed replaced saul with david already br br but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently ill leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretationsbr br watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory
