theres no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  i was quite a hand with a slingshot the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face go and sit with the concubines and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan whatever you say he even tries the old my kingdom doesnt understand me routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point so its probably a tribute to henry kings direction that the film isnt at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide maybe its the censorbaiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatales husband and gets away with it  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunnes script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands and the film doesnt back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wivesbr br unlike king david which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong closeup when visiting the site of saul and jonathans death gregory pecks performance grows in stature as david shrinks susan hayward is pure hollywood pro raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet why be naturalistic when youve got a voice that makes the very heavens quake and kieron moores uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you cant exactly blame david for putting him in harms way but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesnt allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s50s biblical epicsbr br foxs new dvd is a good transfer including an incredibly hokey candid behindthescenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the films sole battle scene
