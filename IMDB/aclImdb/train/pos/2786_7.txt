what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has though i think thats probably because of the mention of beckham in the title more than anything elsebr br its a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message  you can do anything if youre determined enough and put your mind to it which is such a positive message to anyone watching this filmbr br i think this is one of keira knightleys better films and i think shes a brilliant actress and was excellent for the role parminder nagra was brilliant too sadly i cant say this for jonathan rhysmeyers because i dont think that he was that much of a good actor and to be honest his eyes were a little scarybr br all in all a brilliant film and a brilliant story
