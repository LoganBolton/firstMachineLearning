how can a movie be both controversial and gentle this one does it with a nearperfect structure no one wants their daughters to be athletes apparently most cultures dont want their daughters to be smallbreasted either here we see a bunch of superb actors weve never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to and have the potential to become professional soccer players the structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful there is no condescension both cultures are seen as modern and valid and yes both are silly too one flaw the hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them
