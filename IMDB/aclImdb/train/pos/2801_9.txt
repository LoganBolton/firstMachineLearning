my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film bring on the coals ill walk over them as well to say again that i love bend it like beckham granted theres a lot of in spite of in that confession its a bit movieoftheweek the screenplay is on the paintbynumbers side and most troublingly the directors commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skinbr br the films genius is not in whats obvious to the syd fielddoctored eye character arcs themes construction its in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semiclad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do these are real bodies keira knightleys excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and selfdetermination and in my book lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and unbookish intelligence thats utterly compellingbr br the result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like theyre making a pact with the devil to do so as in chadhas bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that cant be neatly slotted into the stodgy sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the films flirtation with lesbianism bend it like beckham has an electricity that cant be reduced to the simple heterohomosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for itbr br oh yes and did i mention that its hilarious
