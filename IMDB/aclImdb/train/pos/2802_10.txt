as someone whos never been into sports it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football or as we americans inexplicably call it soccerthemed bend it like beckham but i gotta say this was one cool movie angloindian jesminder bhamra parminder nagra and her wasp friend juliette paxton keira knightley love to play football yes im going to say it the british  and international  way and just adore football player david beckham but jesminders traditional sikh parents dont approve her mother offers a really whackedout description of football early in the movie okay so maybe it was sort of a clich√© in that sense but you gotta love this movie and if like me you go to this movie not knowing the definition of bend in footballdont worry the movie explains it id also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie and we all know that keira knightley hit it big a few months after bilb came out in the states she starred in the equally cool pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl
