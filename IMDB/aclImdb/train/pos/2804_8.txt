the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a manchester united fan the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting however i put my prejudices behind me and im glad i didbr br i wasnt expecting much of a film but i was pleasantly surprised the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film if you liked east is east then youll love this film ok so the storyline is nothing new and the classic storylines are contained within the film but its all done very funnily and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour and best of all its a good british comedy
