okay first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinionbr br first off bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century if thats what youre looking for go somewhere else just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy its supposed to make you feel good and youre supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplishedbr br secondly the acting though not halle berry in monsters ball is still good the movie doesnt need acting like that honestly so dont look for it its a family movie if thats what you wanted you wouldnt or shouldnt even be looking into this movie honestlybr br lastly it has a really cute story i think its thought out well and its entertaining to watch its also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when youre finished if youre looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for youbr br lyndsay
