silverlake life the view from here is an absolutely stunning movie about aids as well as about a gay love relationship some images are indeed really hard to take especially when one is gay or fears about aids and probably for any sensitive person watching it its not easy to make a movie about such a terrible illness and its consequences about not only one but two peoples lives this movie teaches how to care for each other in such hard times but it never gets too morbid it still shows life at any time reminding you that outside of the theater or of your room life goes on whatever the destiny of some people may be the characters are incredibly endearing while we watch their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit never unveiling anything too private or offensive children should certainly not watch this movie but grownups whether they have to deal with such situations or not should do it and will not regret the tears they shed
