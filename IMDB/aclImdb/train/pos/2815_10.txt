cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews as if it were a mediocre movie of some runofthemill dudesbr br the movie is great funny crazy overthetop violent though with minimum gore and all the way energetic to the core loved every single bit of it cant remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off and now the most important thing at least to me it is computer effects free when i watch some hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern highresolution and damn highbudgeted action fuflo a russian word that means bullbeep i understand that any beep child can do it  you can adjust the wires to the body add some cute pc effects and stuff it into the action film here it is different i dont think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the chinese football play and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun not pretending to be star warsbr br having a dvd with english soundtrack is not a problem with this movie it does not spoil the atmosphere to mebr br cant help mentioning a very neat theatrical play some of you suppose wont like it as to me  its amazing have a look at the dragons friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth  its nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimacesbr br this movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hypebr br total 10 out of 10  a legendary movie in its genre thank you for attention
