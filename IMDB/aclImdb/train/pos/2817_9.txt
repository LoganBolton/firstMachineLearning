this review is for the extended cut of this moviebr br i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general ideabr br that being said ive always found the storyline a bit confusing the movie is after all a love story and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scenebr br well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with a huge barrelclimbrugbylike sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragonjackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is aroundbr br other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like a love story and doesnt leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version doesbr br i suggest everyone who is a hongkong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intendedor at least thats how i think it was intended why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same
