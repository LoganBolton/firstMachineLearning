dragonlord sees chan returning to his role of dragon from the young master not much has carried over from the first film though tiger his older brother is nowhere to be seen neither is the marshall his daughter or his son played superbly by yuen biao in the original film dragon does have the same master though  presumably all the other students have moved on to other things dragons laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film so maybe hes still studying br br originally titled young master in love this film sees dragon for the first sixty minutes at least pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways his rival for her affection is his friend inappropriately named cowboy played comically by the longtime chan stuntteam member mars we see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire it is one of these scenes that we thankfully find dragon in over his headbr br this film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office that said im sure the expectations were pretty high and i feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on its own merits but even when i try to do this i still feel that there is a problem with the film it seems quite unfocused sometimes rushed and i think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as chans other work from this periodbr br the thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence as in the young master there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action  you really feel every blow and again chan goes up against the same rival from the young master is it the same character and the timing and energy here is brilliant chans style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent  not just relying on pure physical ability  is as apparent here as anywhere else the barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations this is an absolute highlight of the film and one of chans incredible careerbr br its not necessary to see the prequel before seeing dragonlord in fact it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer but it must be said that the original film is the superior film and dragonlord with its focus on girlchasing and teamsports does seem baffling luckily the few fight scenes it offers plus a fantastic shuttlecock scene push it over the line as a mustsee film in this genre
