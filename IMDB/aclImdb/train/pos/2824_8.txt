greta garbos american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions as in a torrent causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the waybr br greta plays leonora a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortezs character don rafael a landowner ricardo is in love with her too but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman in reality part of her attitude is bitterness over rafaels abandonmentbr br she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael surprisingly no one knows that shes the famous la brunna and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayalsbr br ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mamas boy and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie he fails to win leonora when she returns home and later when he follows her his courage is underminedbr br this movie is beautifully shot with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield tully marshall and mack swainbr br although this is a story of lost love and missed chances i dont think leonora and rafael would have been happy together as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and i dont think would have been happy in a small village the ending is true to life and pulls no punchesbr br see this one as garbos american film debut and a precursor of things to come
