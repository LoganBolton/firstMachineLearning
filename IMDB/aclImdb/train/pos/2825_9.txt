this film was quite a surprise i wasnt expecting much to be honest greta garbos first hollywood film so what probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated armwaving and facial contortions that lowgrade silent films so often showbr br well was i mistaken greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me because this film made her a star and deservedly so she instinctively understood the power of just standing still or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen i kept thinking to myself how did this modern actress get into a creaky silent film she was just years and years ahead of her timebr br the story isnt all that interesting it is the usual tale of love found and lost it is only the performance of garbo as leonora the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away that gives it life costar ricardo cortez is serviceable but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout at one point he is made to wear garbos clothes leave in a huff then ignominiously return and give them back and lets not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife way too ordinary he didnt have much of a career after this and i can understand why but he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of leonoras obsessionbr br there is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all leonora you are becoming conspicuous yes conspicuous indeedbr br if you really want to know what its all about without seeing the whole film just watch the last 30 seconds or so  garbos glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything she must be so happy she has everything she wants  yes garbos face says it all about that i have to see this one again garbo is just amazing
