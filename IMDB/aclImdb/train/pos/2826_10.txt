i was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive paramount chain of vaudeville houses this paramount has a mighty wurlitzer organ  also magnificently restored  that was used to accompany the silent films of the daybr br we were fortunate enough to have dennis james a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the mighty wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film the print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a onceinalifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seenbr br this was greta garbos first american film she was only 20 years old but already had 6 swedish films in her repertoirebr br it is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star even though the mighty wurlitzer added immensely to the miseenscene it was necessary to leave much to the imaginationbr br modern audiences for the most part do not understand silent films acting was different then with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy and overdone  but it was simply the style of the periodbr br garbo with all her subtlety did much to usher in the new age of acting she could say more with a halfclosed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug she exemplifies the truism that a picture is worth a thousand wordsbr br even though this is garbos first american film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands this was mgm filmmaking at its best the sets and costumes were magnificent the special effects  which by todays standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazingbr br the script by vicente blasco ibanez from the novel by entre naranjos would seem to be tailor made for garbo it showcases her strengths magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with a swedish actress can play a spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our partbr br her costar was mgms answer to rudolph valentino ricardo cortez he does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film allow himself to look unnactractive appear foolish and to grow old ungracefullybr br there are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was garbo notable among them are lucien littlefield as cupido and martha mattox as doña bernarda brullbr br this is when the extraordinary cinematographer william h daniels met garbo  they went on to make 20 films together he was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades he was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known the divine garbo without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she wasbr br seeing this film is an alltoorare opportunity if you ever have the chance do not miss it
