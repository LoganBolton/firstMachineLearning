this is probably one of the worst movies ever made itsterrible but its so good its probably best if you dont watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because youre going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goros fantastic hairbad english youre in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless youre having a competition to spot the most plot holesscrew ups in which case youve got hours of entertainment ahead id only really recommend this film for the bored or the diehard smap fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because goros japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out he wasnt really not when johnny kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him
