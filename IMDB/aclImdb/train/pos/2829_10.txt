without a doubt private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen a japanese import poorly translated into english its a joy to watch not much of it makes sense but that doesnt matter its the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funnybr br the film is rare and unavailable on video but i have caught it a couple of time late late at night on pay cable my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly personbyperson introduce this film gem to the worldbr br joanna pacula plays the tutorlover to ken our hero she apparently was just working for her check ken is played by goro inagaki of the japanese pop band smap who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie stacy edwards of in the company of men fame shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwardsbr br it takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases ken has in his house at least 50 or that ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movies finalebr br the movie is predictable but highly quotable my friends and i reenact entire scenes yes it sounds like were lame losers and we are  but were lame losers who have seen private lessons ii be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie youll thank me for it
