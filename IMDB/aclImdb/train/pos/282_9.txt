this is undeniably the scariest game ive ever played its not the average shooteverythingthatmoves kind of fps which i usually dont care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game ive had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere im a great horror fan escpecially of clive barkers stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 910 1 because im no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
