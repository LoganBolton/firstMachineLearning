i stumbled onto this movie when i was ebaying caesars palace stuff as im enamoured with its rich vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still standing in good condition unless you count ballys the original mgm grand in that respect this movie delivers fullforce youre given a grand tour of the caesars propertywhich in spite of all the renovations and additions theyve done over the 40 years its been open looks alarmingly similar as a film overall the plot is somewhat difficult to follow thanks in large part to the horrendous editing and when i say horrendous im not using that word lightly theres a lot of splicedin secondlong snippets of vegas traffic casino crowds and even a scene where the robert drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much hes grown up and without any explanation he drivas goes in those infamous snippets from being himself to a baby to a little boy and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father that doesnt give away any plot details if anything one can be prepared for it and maybe they wont be as flabbergasted as i was by the editing the film has aged well otherwise and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion
