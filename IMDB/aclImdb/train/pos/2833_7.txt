just resaw this movie after thirty seven years i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue in 1969 i thought where its at was a very good movie now however after almost forty years its not as good as it was times have changed and this movie is now a tired old rehash of the war between the generations it did however catch a place in time which is just a memory its really interesting to see the mod fashions the old vegas a slim don rickles chain smoking and a hip opening song the acting was decent the script somewhat outdated but the memories were still fresh where its at may not be where its at for you but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane
