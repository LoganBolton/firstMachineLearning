i havent seen much german comedy but if this film is anything to go by im compelled to see more the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva an unemployed mother of two discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer i wont reveal anything further but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film i recommend it to anyone any adult dont let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking its a family film who love comedy  even those unfamiliar with the language
