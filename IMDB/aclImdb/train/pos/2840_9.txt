i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one timebr br i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see rachael bilson and hayden back together i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera my favorite scene was by far surprisingly so bret ratners piece without giving too much away ill just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hangingbr br the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together br br both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that ive had in the big apple over all the film is a great place to take a date especially if youre already fond of the city itselfbr br i cant wait for the next in the cities of love
