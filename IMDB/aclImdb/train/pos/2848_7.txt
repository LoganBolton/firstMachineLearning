new york i love you is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long the shorts dont exactly relate but they all have something in common love every short is about finding love either if its about a couple or just two strangers chitchattingthe film stars an ensemble cast among them shia labeouf natalie portman hayden christensen orlando bloom chris cooper andy garcia christina ricci irrfan khan robin wright penn julie christie ethan hawke bradley cooper rachel bilson and anton yelchin with such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise i was expecting a tremendous film the problem is new york i love you doesnt add up it remains the sum of its parts some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless orlando bloomchristina ricci and ethan hawkemaggie q segments that its appalling the film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone storywise it seems like something a few film students could put together having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by eli wallach and cloris leachman walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary and its moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because theres a lot of potential here but as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing the editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldnt be more fitting in the end new york i love you feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences theres highs and lows its how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for othersbr br 710
