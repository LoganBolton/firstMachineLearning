i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying muchbr br the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me youll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interestingbr br the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skitsscenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the inbetween category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york citys diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris jetaimes plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like thatbr br still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe youll disagree with my opinion and maybe you wont you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyones opinion on art differs im just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect
