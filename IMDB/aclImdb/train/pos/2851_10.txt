japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence as they are running we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment the act of running is a metaphor for these downontheir luck peoples lives in some way what theyre really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams running makes them all feel truly alive the big lifealtering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big violent and so absurd that its funny in a clever way one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu
