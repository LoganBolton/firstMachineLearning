i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster vhs i have to agree that it is wildly original yes maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isnt one of those movies rather we are treated to the directors eye his vision of what the story is about and it does not stop and to be honest i didnt want it to i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the directors of lock stock  two smoking barrels and run lola run but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily i really need to see this directors other work because this film really intrigued me if you want insight culture sturm und drang go somewhere else if you want a laugh camera movement and criminal hilarity look here
