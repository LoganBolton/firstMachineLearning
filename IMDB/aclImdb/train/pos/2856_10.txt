this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them its packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail as in sabus subsequent movies i didnt see unlucky monkey yet but the other ones are as great failure chance and humanism play great roles the cutting and montage is inventive and artistic without the movie being an art picture but a highly entertaining one when comparing it to run lola run you have to keep in mind that dangan ranna was made some years before and was shown on german tv as early as 1997so its more probable that it served as inspiration for tom tykwers movie and not the other way around complementary to the other reviews i have to add that i like the acting and the ending very much this movie is a lot of fun in many ways and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious
