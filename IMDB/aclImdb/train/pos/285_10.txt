i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies we dont read that much anymore instead people want to see movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more please make all 8 movies please dont change any of the characters either it ruins the effect because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters please make all 8 movies i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray we dont get that enough anymore awesome job
