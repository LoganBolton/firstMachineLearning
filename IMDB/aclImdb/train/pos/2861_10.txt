i love this show and my 11 yearold daughter and i love watching it together it teaches good old fashioned values in a fun adventuresome and entertaining way albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time its also really fun to make fun ofyou know rewind and insert your own dialog in place of the actorsbr br i have my dvr set to record all the episodes and i happened to catch the tail end of an episode just prior to the next one startingso i dont know what episode it was but there was an absolutely terrible sequencing mistake adam had handed sheriff coffee a small swatch of leather which was torn from some outlaws coat as he tried to make his getaway i supposebr br well roy happened to have the coat so he laid it out on his desk and placed the swatch right where it had been torn from the swatch was exactly rectangularwhich i reckon would be nearly impossible to tear from a piece of leather post1950s naugahyde yes leather i dont think so well the swatch lined up perfectly and the mystery was solvedbr br not 10 seconds later in the scene we see the coat again still lying on roys desk but this time the swatch is more like the shape of north carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat and the seam which was smackdab in the middle of the swatch is now goneas is the seam in the coat my daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again its prime for youtube i tell yabr br we still totally love the show though and the sequencing errors make it lots of fun
