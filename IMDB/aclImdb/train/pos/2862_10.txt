my comment is limited generally to the first season 195960br br this superb series was one of the first to be televised in color and it was highly influential in persuading americans that they had to buy a color television set which was about 800 in 1959 the equivalent of more than 3000 today how many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17inch screen i was eleven when the series began and i watched it from the beginningbr br watching it now 50 years later several things come to mind first many of the story lines involve the comstock lode and the heyday of silver mining which dates to 1859 for 1859 the weapons and clothes are for the most part not authentic the haircuts are left out of the discussion thats basically a nitpickbr br and it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100square mile ranch in the next twenty years pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as 1847 and the gold rush did not even begin until two years laterbr br indians are not played by native american actors john ford was using native american actors in the 1920s the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later that is a major nitpick for mebr br there are other timeline problems in season 1 mark twain appears and he is depicted as a middleaged man mark twain was 24 yearsold in 1859 the stories also vacillate between 18591860 precivil war and what was more suitable for an 1880 timeframe there are continuity problems over and overbr br it is somewhat offputting too that there is so much killing in the first season in time the killing was reducedbr br many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant which would be hard to believe given the timeline but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nations attitudes beginning in the 1960sbr br having said all that the acting is good and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adams character was drawn better than any others i dont think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved also season 1 reinforces the fact that dan blocker hoss was a good actorbr br many of the stories trace real historical events the guest stars were interestingbr br this was great family entertainment and the series stands up very well by any measure
