although this show has been off the air since 1973 after viewing a dvd set i borrowed at our library i felt compelled to say a bit about itbr br i can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s and sometimes there would be a little sunday night party with friends to watch this on nbc on one of the few color televisionsbr br i really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time case in point virginia city nevada which became one of the richest cities in the world because of the silver got its name from a character named old virginny who in the towns early days stumbled out of a saloon fell and broke his whiskey bottlebr br old virginny didnt want to waste the occasion so as the precious liquid was seeping into the dirt he decided to christen the town virginia town the area became known as the comstock lode because another character henry comstock had the reputation of trying to jump everyones claim and the area became known as the comstock lodebr br i just watched an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects other episodes dealt with mark twains literary rise while a reporter for the territorial enterprisebr br it was wholesome and frequently educational family entertainment as someone else remarked each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right  rich scripts and characters br br one thing it twisted the truth on was the proximity to virginia city and the ponderosa in truth to ride from the ponderosa all of northern lake tahoe one would have to ride his horse about 3000 feet 1000 meters down the spooner summit to the high desert 30004000 feet of the carson valley then another 3040 miles to virginia citybr br needless to say the cartwrights would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis but every writer should have some leeway with the truthbr br how i miss that show even today
