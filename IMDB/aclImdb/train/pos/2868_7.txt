first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even nonebr br and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when leão da estrela e costa do castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like pulsação zero or sorte nula both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in commonbr br this one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid br br the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenixbr br if you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured
