this is one of disneys top five animated features in my opinion cinderella was a perfect return to the fulllength feature animation film as opposed to the compilation films of the 40s and expensive depth via the multiplane camera returns to the film in no other way although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizationsa clear time period the story takes placebr br cinderella is more mature than snow white and a multidimensional character actually all of the characters are somewhat welldeveloped except for the princeleft the most flatwe know he has a sense of humor and a great smile but thats about all like snow white disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culturein most versions of cinderella the stepsisters are attractive just not as pretty as cinderella and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearancebr br favorite disney additions the mice also appreciated the continuitycinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a childi remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it the broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeataudley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villains satanic witch maleficent in sleeping beauty
