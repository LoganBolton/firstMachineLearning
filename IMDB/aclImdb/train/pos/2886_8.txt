cinderella is a beautiful film with beautiful songs of course in fact its one of the best films of the 1950sbr br i think all the characters are portrayed amazingly you can see the cruelness of cinderellas stepsisters and her stepmother the sweetness of cinderella the mice are funny and sweet toobr br i think they changed the tale a bit but i think its for the best its such a nice film and i dont think anyone could resist it deep downbr br i give it a 810 i dont think its the best disney film but it sure is a true classic
