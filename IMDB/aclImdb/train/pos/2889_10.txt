might not consider this having a spoiler but id rather be cautious than careless i never saw this movie when i was little i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter i can watch it over and over againbr br for the little acting ilene woods did in her lifetime she was a wonderful voice for cinderella very appealing very believable the music really fit the movie perfectly the acting was great loved the mice you really hated lady tremain and the stepsisters they were just awful the cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very wellbr br this is a wonderful movie especially if you are into love stories my daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end
