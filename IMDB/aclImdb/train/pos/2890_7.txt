the 12th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story even though a little dated it deserves a place in the list of disney classicsbr br its not among disneys top works but is satisfying one of disneys most simple works yes but keeps a certain magic and enchantment which old disney is well known for this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation if this was a failure there wouldnt be any more disney animated classicsbr br cinderella is somehow like a return to disneys 1st animated classic snow white and the seven dwarfs because it brings back the fairy tale genre its not clear where the story takes place but i suppose its somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perraultbr br there are plenty of likable characters such as cinderella the prince bruno the dog jaques and gus the two main mice the fairy godmother for a fairy she sure is funny the birds the king and the grand dukebr br jaques is very smart and amusing i love his voice really has that mouselike quality gus might not be that smart but hes humorousbr br the king is hilarious but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too theyre two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing momentsbr br the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney no doubt that prince philip from sleeping beauty was inspired on this prince because they are very similarlookingbr br on the other hand lady tremaine the stepmother isnt supposed to be likable because shes cold jealous bitter and cruel her daughters anastacia and drizella arent much better than her however the stepmother isnt as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters cinderella the main character has nothing to do with them cinderella is gentle kind pretty and lovable by the way i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmotherbr br lucifer the cat is hilariously malicious the way he walks sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny ironically hes very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality he always agrees with the stepmothers attitudes towards cinderella lucifer has the right name for him because hes such a devilish and mean cat yet theres nothing annoying about himbr br the soundtrack is simple but pleasant although not among disneys best the best song in this movie is bibiddi bobiddi boobr br there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this such as james macdonald marion darlington eleanor audley verna felton and luis van rootenbr br despite being simplelooking the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details although never something outofthisworld however the kings palace is a spectacular masterpiece being truly majestic and colossal
