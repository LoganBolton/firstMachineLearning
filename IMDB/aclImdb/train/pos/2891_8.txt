we watched this on the wonderful world of disney on abc last night and i came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at the mouse than usual br br since this movie only runs 74 minutes and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time they had and im not making this up commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes and during these commercial breaks they had another advertisement in the guise of a tv show hosted by the ohsoannoying kelly rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of cinderella 2 dreams come truebr br again and again break after break disney took time out of the real movie to tell us the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel thank you disney for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a moviebr br anyway all this commercialism and cashregisterringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of cinderella because by the time the commercials were over i had forgotten where the story had left offbr br but of course the original cinderella still maintains its magic and the story is still a good one though weve all seen it countless times its a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame followup
