as a young boy i always sort of hated cinderella since i was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what disney movie to buy i wanted dumbo but my sisters won out and we got cinderella they thoroughly enjoyed the movie while i sulked in the back of the room playing with my star wars action figuresbr br a lot has changed since then my love of the disney theme parks landed me an internship at walt disney world and i now have two young nieces i like to showcase disney to them as much as i can and we recently watched cinderella together with my newfound appreciation for all that is disney i watched cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed with what i sawbr br from the beginning of the movie though i didnt quite understand why cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament why was she such a slave to her stepfamily and why couldnt she just run away i wasnt too sympathetic to cinderella but as the story progressed i found myself becoming immersed in the story maybe the eyecatching animation or the funloving characters drew me in or maybe it was the timeless songs listening to songs like bibbidybobbidyboo and a dream is a wish your heart makes sort of whisked me back to the theme parks i can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the aweinspiring cinderella castlebr br something about this movie just evokes the magic of disney that may make many people scoff but go to the magic kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world and youll know what im talking about the images of cinderella and the glass slipper  as well as mickey mouse winnie the pooh and tinkerbell  embody why disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire worldbr br while cinderella may not be the strongest story it is sort of iconic in disney and movie history it represents that fun idealistic and fantasylike wonderment we held when we were kids i imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many many people out there it may not be my favorite disney movie but it does represent all that i love and admire about the companybr br my imdb rating 1010 my yahoo grade a outstanding
