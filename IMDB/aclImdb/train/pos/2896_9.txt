people criticise disneys animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy set in landscapes that are much too pristine that criticism is just and yet it cant be the whole story because the two least glossy  alice in wonderland and peter pan  are also the weakest cinderella on the other hand set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles is clearly the bestbr br it does look good the backgrounds are subtle and consistent the colours are pure without being too bright the animation varies a bit ill swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped  but then the rotoscoped humans including cinderella herself arent fullblooded characters in the script so this approach works well enough its really the animals that make the movie i think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before as totems rather than sidekicks the mice for instance are the creatures who draw us into the story but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless cinderella the cat lucifer is a kind of witchs familiar to the wicked stepmother the cat is brilliantly conceived and animated  one of the best feline creations of all time the supervising animator was ward kimball and he modelled it on his own cat i wonder how he put up with the animal this approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main storybr br among the supporting cast the notable humans are the king and the grand duke the king is a one note character  he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all  but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion the grand duke is a putupon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as cinderella does although he of course is richerbr br cinderella is disneys return to features after an eightyear hiatus and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years moreover he made things hard for himself by picking cinderella shes a passive heroine and theres not much anyone can do about that maybe im wrong on this score  i havent seen the recent ever after nonetheless it is remarkable how successful disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life without cutting across the grain of its spirit
