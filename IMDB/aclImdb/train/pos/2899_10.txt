very intelligent humor excellent performing i cant believe how people could think it deserves a 110 i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity watch it dont miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing happy birthday and el payaso plinplin an argentinian song for kids i think it could also be south american im not sure this two songs that have the same melody but people dont usually realize that its just grate i tried to write this in both spanish and english because its an argentinian movie but the page wouldnt allow me  hope you enjoy it
