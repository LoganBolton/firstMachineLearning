should this be an american movie id rate it 7 weve seen this before being this an argentinean movie and being myself argentine id like to give it a 10 since its the kind of quality id been hoping rather than expecting for its superb quality is astonishing given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd worldbr br i cant forget the scene when díaz forces silversteins fiancé to confess you know what i mean if you saw the movie i think thats the key moment of the movie not surprising maybe yet original thats when the real action beginsbr br before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information being this a mainstream satyric commercial one i press play and make a suspension of reality and logic id say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this its impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot yet its believable in a certain way as for me i couldnt stop laughing at every single joke and commentary sos malo youre mean put in the mouth of díaz the greatest onebr br im rather tired of seeing movies designed for peretti i know hes a superb actor but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest luis luques role in this case im not very fond of argentine television so i havent seen much work from luque but its pretty obvious that hes an excellent performer his physical role his stares his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance i think his role should need some upgrading just to let him show us how great he can bebr br i dont know whether szifrón is planning to make a sequel or not i know he wont make it if its to follow the rule that second parts were never good so if he makes it ill surely go see it and i hope that in the future takes into account the possibility to give perettis counterparts the same chances to develop their rolesbr br great movie great performances and lots of laughs
