i sit through movies like tiempo de valientes and i want to talk about cinema for hours the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because im watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for filmmaking ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifrons mindbr br looking the environment so uncompromised so simple im thinking this man is a genius no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors havent still achieved el fondo del mar is the name and it awakened a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinemabr br starting his journey from peoples daily real lives szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in el bonaerense the federal police departments life traperos film was a journey into a mans mind and experiences not into the places he saw yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but szifron in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling musicbr br but theres a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters alfredo díaz and mariano silverstein there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film cant do without the first character luis luque is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him and has to work on a casebr br the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins díaz in his routines its nothing the usual stuff no problem but it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctors personality he didnt knowbr br the relationship developed between the two leads cant be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying today to leave a signature in our history reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high pressure situation díaz tells silverstein how do we continue our treatment and silverstein answers no im not your doctor you call me to have dinner im your friend we laugh because we cant help itbr br and we cant help laughing when díaz crashes a car in the street and doesnt gives importance to it or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein cant believe it but then smokes it too because hes screwed up or when silverstein tries to be friendly with díazs robber friends magic from diego peretti is what we receive there he a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan locas de amor but impresses with all his range luis luque on the other hand is back on track with a topnotch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he isbr br theres a passion i have for this and as i said i could write about it for hours but unfortunately thats not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them i could assure that tiempo de valientes is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never gotuntil now
