we toss around the term superstar way too lightly these days but heres one guy that truly deserves itbr br i was glued to the set this entire show the song selection was perfect  it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment with songs of this strength you dont need a circus to be entertainedbr br the shots of the crowd were amazing too how many performers can affect the original beatles fans now in their 50s and beyond get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of cant buy me love and impact everyone in between br br while watching i also realized that in the wake of john lennons tragic death paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought paul not only lost john and george no matter what their final relations were it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennons murder received i agree that lennons murder was horrible but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath i was very happy that hes found love again in heatherbr br as for those complaining about the audiovideo quality i had no complaints whatsoever both were crystal clear on my set i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out theyll never be satisfiedbr br my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance thanks to this video i was able to enjoy itbr br when people remember john lennon they will first remember his murder and then his music i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney because if nothing else he will be remembered for his music first and lets hope another lunatic wont change this because the mccartney catalog is pretty good
