i saw the film twice in the space of one week both times the at a cinema in orpington kent uk the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away from the start of the film with henry winkler getting injured on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter laughter that lasted until the creditsbr br for those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a headbutbr br if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best
