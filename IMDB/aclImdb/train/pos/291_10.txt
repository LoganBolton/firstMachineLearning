zombie chronicles isnt something to shout about its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining bmovie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget bmovies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
