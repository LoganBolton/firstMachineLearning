this movie is a perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups those who get the joke and those who dont people usually attack what they dont understand this film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since its a great comedy and a great romance its a perfect date movie a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh and if your perspective is too tense maybe this movie isnt for you and you may need counseling it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80s having never seen the light of day on dvd yet they feel an urban version of the honeymooners is a good idea i find it odd that my two alltime favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd the other being gene wilders the worlds greatest lover which fox has sat on since the early 80s as well yet from justin to kelly is in nearly every video store in the country there is no justice in the world maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy from justin to kelly im sure that one is watered enough for them to get sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of full house
