okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first  this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d what its not that hard to film in a car second  the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with itbr br third  why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh  but dont waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
