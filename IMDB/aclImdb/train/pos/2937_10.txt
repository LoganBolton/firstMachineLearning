i know its crude and i know that it isnt at all pc but its so funny if you can put it into perspective that its from the early 80s and it carries all the stereotypes of the timeand the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughterthan it is truly a good comedy going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years the subject matter of this film is exagerated if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half just to have an allout laugh than please watch thisbr br ps would someone please put this out on dvd its so hard to find on vhs anymore
