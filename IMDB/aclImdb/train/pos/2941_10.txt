this is the ultimate oneman show in which eddie murphy is at his very best just forget the nutty professor and the distinguished gentlemen this is the real eddie murphy his imitations of mr t pretending he is gay michael jackson and other artists are killers i think its also quite daring to make fun of artists who where really popular in that time my favorite act is the one where he is at his annual bbq with the family and plays his drunken dad and aunt bunny who falls from the stairsbr br this show is the best medicine when you feel down  if you watch the sequel raw dont be disappointed its quite good too but doesnt match delirious
