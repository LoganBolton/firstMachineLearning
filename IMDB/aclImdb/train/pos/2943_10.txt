i think this still is the best routine there are some others like rocks bring the pain and allens men are pigs that are hilarious damon waynes last stand is also funny in a tearful way  but this routine has no errors all the jokes are funny and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect just long enough to last 20 years i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted im a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and newhart but something you can watch if youre bloated thanks eddie god bless
