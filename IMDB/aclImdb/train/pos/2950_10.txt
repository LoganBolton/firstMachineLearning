if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably delirious you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphys delirious and raw not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that im older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard thats the huge difference eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful  and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king and delirious was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time
