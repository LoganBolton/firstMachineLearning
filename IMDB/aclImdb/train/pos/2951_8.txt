yeah its a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but its actually pretty good  and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what shes in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performancebr br the scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an 810 go see it
