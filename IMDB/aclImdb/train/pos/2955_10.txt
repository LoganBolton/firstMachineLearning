theres a certain allure ive always found in discovering the great semi unknown film these discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films  in my experience unknown scifi action and horror are unknown for very very good reasons i found high tide on video at a junk store mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality of course thats the only place i would find it as it is still not on dvdbr br while i was watching judy davis as lillie throughout the course of this film i was somehow certain i was watching a great undiscovered performance yes i had previously seen davis in several small parts  and one starring role in a passage to india but although she was superb in the aforementioned film high tide is a different animal entirely since recently watching gillian armstrongs later film charlotte gray i was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to cate blanchett  in both manner and sensibilitybr br judy davis performance is stunning i cannot say enough good things about it she shares an amazing onscreen relationship with young claudia karvan as ally this films other great actress theres a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together the details of which i wont presume to reveal here see it for yourself theres too much good in high tide to cover in one review indeed i would hardly care to  the film speaks well enough for itself in conclusion i would like to praise screenwriter laura jones for her stunning dialogue director gillian armstrong for her understanding of actors and the great russell boyd for his brilliant understated cinematography please see his work in tender mercies
