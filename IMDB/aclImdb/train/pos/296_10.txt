sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of if not his best its my most loved of all bogdanovich moviesbr br this unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is or should be about love lost or failure and hope and faith and charity as the song from whom the films takes its title gershwins well known composition the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes with the detectives following the ladies almost without a line of dialogue constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that bogdanovich touch based on the pointofview is a class on cinema language something that pb learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of sinatras trilogy this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness as some critics wrote deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed its not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful
