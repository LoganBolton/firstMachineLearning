this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and theres much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy localboysdonegoodovercomingadversity genre of which this parodies dont let anyone tell you that theyre trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities sure theres plenty of that but its all contextual not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me Â£299 on dvd  so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film ive seen this year
