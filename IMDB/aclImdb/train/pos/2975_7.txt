trey parker and matt stone the creators of the show south park  return with something entirely differentthey create a new sport that combines baseball and basketballthis sport is known as baseketballits like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and theres another letter e in the titleheres how you play you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shotsounds simplein fact i might try it one dayafter the game hits the streets it soon becomes a huge successwho wouldve known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successfulbr br my opinionbr br baseketball is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainmenta definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor
