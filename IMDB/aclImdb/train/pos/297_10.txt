i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it doesnt have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why  bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches the cast especially coleen camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film youve seen worse movies
