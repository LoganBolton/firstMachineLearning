i thoroughly enjoyed this flick i am of the firm belief that matt stone and trey parker are comic geniuses of our time they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way if that makes any sense this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed that is apparent in baseketball although it is directed by david zucker and is utterly rediculous it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love the opening prologue is brillianttears from laughter form everytime i see those football players begin riverdance some may not like this movie because its just not everyones cup of teabut just like south park once you look past the absurdityit has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius i gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars
