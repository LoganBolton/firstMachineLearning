im amazed we see even one naysayer criticizing this old film we dont ordinarily get good opera films and here is a true grand opera rendition understandably the visuals are not great its dated but as opera it cant be faulted and im an opera buff i cant even detect one lipsync if we didnt know that was tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isnt sophia loren she does everything with flair her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role to gorgeous life the rest of the cast is wonderful as is that stunning ballet troupe most of the actors are excellent loren truly marvelous her rival amneris is also terrific whoever didnt care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss verdi would have enjoyed it naturally renata tebaldi as aida is the engine behind the scenes i love this old movie
