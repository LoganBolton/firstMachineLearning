it appears even the director doesnt like this filmbut for me i think hes being a bit harsh on himselfbr br sure its not perfect but there are some atmospheric shotsand the story is good enough to keep you interested throughoutbr br its shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as wellbr br if you like horror films shot in england give it a gobr br i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film the devils chair which looks quite amazingbr br there arent enough english horror films for me so any that come along deserve our attention and this one isnt as bad as you may think
