there were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be but i guess thats part of its charm detective philo vances powers of observation seem greater than all the oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes down to that final evaluation of how the murders were committed the dropping of the dagger into the chinese vase was the kicker for me i mean couldnt somebody have just dropped it br br vance william powell had a line early in the film about archer coes psychological impossibility to kill himself  i had to think about that for a while i was left wondering if theres some scientific basis in fact for that concept to be true not having studied psychology myself seems logical but then theres always the case that doesnt fit the rulesbr br you know i got a kick out of the agitated coroner etienne girardot who reminded me of star treks dr mccoy the couple of times he stated im a doctor not a magician and im a doctor not a detective i can picture deforrest kelley watching the film and saying to himself  ill have to use that sometimebr br once the killers identity is revealed it doesnt seem like such a big surprise but up till then its really anybodys guess but archer and brisbane coe aside the film didnt answer the central question posed by the title and the murder i was really interested in  who killed sir thomas macdonalds dog ghillie
