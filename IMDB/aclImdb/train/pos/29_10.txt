there are some films that every horror fan owes himself or herself to see and emilio miraglias la dama rossa uccide sette volte aka the red queen kills seven times 1972 is definitely one of them with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite subgenres in horror i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes miraglias earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave 1971 was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it couldnt possibly compare to this instant personal favorite the red queen kills seven times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements the red queen delivers everything one could hope for in either subgenre an inventive and incredibly compelling plot spinechilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet  this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terrorbr br the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany as little girls kitty wildenbr√ºck and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people fourteen years later kitty barbara bouchet has become a successful fashion photographer suddenly people begin to get murdered director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem the red queen kills seven times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plotwise the haunting painting in the grandfathers castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps the red lady or red queen as she is called in the english title is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo the spinechilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own br br a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that the ravishing barbara bouchet one of my favorite actresses must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too bouchets presence has graded up many italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cultmasterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year 1972 fernando di leos milano calibro 9 lucio fulcis giallohighlight dont torture a duckling and this unforgettable gem apart from the wonderful miss bouchet the films gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning marina malfatti the night evelyn came out of the grave and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera br br as the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory bruno nicolais mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the films intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tensionlevel increses with each passing minute the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second overall this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made and a toppriority for every fan of horror andor italian cinema to see 1010
