this is still the benchmark to judge all golden age whodunnits by and taking into account the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities on screen bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since on film and tv fast and furious with plenty of warner bros wipes and thankfully no time for a love interest it gallops along taking the splendid cast with it to the violent end i never understood why the da had to trail vance around everywhere i always thought they were deskbound palette as the detective but especially girardot as the doctor are delightfully eccentric and unpc  when glancing over the second murder victim he sniffs that there were too many people in the world anyway of course it is william powell as philo vance and michael curtiz as director that makes the film what it is  when did powell ever make a dudbr br the army of cops at the crime scene didnt really do a very good job in finding the second dead body and unconscious dog did they the best bit is where vance narrates to us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders  dodgy model sets combine with fantastic roving camera angles to produce a very modern feel and startling with what has gone before the only problem is as usual the conclusion cant match the overall deductive processes displayed throughout and a somewhat contrived ending is invoked some chans motos and many others of course could only be concluded this way too but because it happens so fast and is  slightly dubious morally it doesnt lessen my opinion of kmcs status as a classicbr br all the prints ive ever seen of kmc are at worst like looking into a goldfish bowl so if youre interested in seeing it bear with it until youre sucked in
