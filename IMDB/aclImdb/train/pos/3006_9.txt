while a 9 might seem like an unusually high score for such a slight film however compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series detective films from the 1930s and 40s this is among the very best and also compares very favorably to powells later thin man films now this does not mean that the film is that similar to the thin man movies as the kennel murder case is not a comedy but more a traditional mysterydetective film now youd think that not having nora charles or asta or a traditional comic sidekick something found in practically all series detective films along for fun would be a detriment but i didnt miss them at all because this was such an exceptionally wellwritten filmhaving a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by allbr br the film begins at the dog show and is called the kennel murder case though this philo vance film actually spends little of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a superimportant part of the film instead a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed rooman idea repeated in quite a few other detective films such as crime doctors strangest case however how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together very wellkeeping my interest throughout i sure wish other detective films of the day had as intelligently written plots and exceptional acting as this one this one is definitely a keeper
