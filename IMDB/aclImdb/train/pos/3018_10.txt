this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original its comedy at its best this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a jokebr br its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a requirementbr br g√∂ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor expediton robinson in swedish this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience thus dont see it if you arent familiar with sweden and its language otherwise have fun johan
