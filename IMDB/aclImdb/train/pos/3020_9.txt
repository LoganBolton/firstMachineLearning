im feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the uncleverse the year was 1972 and itv ran all eight features in one bumper run  followed by reruns of the persuaders starring tony curtis and roger moore  on saturday evenings the karate killers was chosen to open the season it commenced with a cool action sequence as solo and kuryakins sports car got attacked by a squadron of thrush minicopters i was a fan for life from that moment onbr br after the main credits  nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage  we go to the laboratory of drsimon true  jim boles  inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater trues wife amanda  joan crawford  has been having an affair with thrush agent randolph  herbert lom  a ruthless fellow indeed he kills both the doctor and his wife before hunting for the formula true has prepared for the event  he has divided it into five segments each written on a photograph of himself and sent it to his five daughters all of whom are scattered throughout the worldbr br solo and kuryakin set out to get the formula first leading to a string of episodes in different locations and cameos from the likes of telly savalas  as a tightfisted italian count  terrythomas and curt jurgens one of drtrues daughters  sandy  kim darby   accompanies the uncle boys on their global questbr br having assembled the formula thrush turns up and makes them hand it over before whisking them off to their secret base at the north polebr br of all the uncle feature films this is the one i feel should have been produced specially for the cinema it hurts by being a television product albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual no location filming was done and the various segments come across as repetitive usually culminating in a scrap between uncle and thrush of the cast joan crawford is memorably hammy in her small role and curt jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy as a london bobby terrythomas is as delightful as ever and herbert lom good as the chief villain kim darby grates though as sandy she should have been told to stay at homebr br what is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time including in like flint casino royale and the ambushers id love to know how solo and company escaped from thrush hq after randolphs death though
