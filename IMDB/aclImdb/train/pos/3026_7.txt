charles boyer is supposed to be spanish and hes come to london to buy coal in confidential agent a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall katina paxinou peter lorre dan seymour and wanda hendrix boyer is luis denard and everyone is out to stop him except bacall his papers are stolen hes accused of murder but hes determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the fascistsbr br this film has its good and not so good points it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense and it is highly entertaining bacall is incredibly beautiful boyer is passionate paxinou is mean lorre is slimy hendrix appropriately pathetic and seymour outrageously wonderfulbr br the not so good points bacall is supposed to be english and boyer spanish uh no boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent but bacall is 100 american not of the british upper class the two have no chemistry conclusion bacall is somewhat miscast her acting isnt up to snuff either shes better in other films but shes an astonishing looking woman and much can be forgivenbr br paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature its a great part and his performance is perfect while some of the direction of the other actors isnt as good this was definitely a case of no small parts only small actors seymour wasnt a small actorbr br definitely worth seeing even with its flaws
