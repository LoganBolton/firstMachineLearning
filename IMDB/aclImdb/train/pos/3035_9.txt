macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great manÂ…general douglas macarthur this is of course the story of one of americas great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a continuity issue there may be others eg macarthurs speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the us military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they just fade away that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman in 1951 for his alleged insubordination these two did not see eye to eye gregory peck is impeckable as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii the film moves quickly and easily with the general his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war nevertheless pecks portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed in war there is no substitute for victory
