the movie macarthur begins and ends at gen douglas macarthurs gregory peck alma mata the us military academy of west point on the hudson we see a frail 82 year old genmacarthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country the film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on gen macarthurs brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of wwii on the besieged island of corregidor in the philippines in the early spring of 1942br br told to leave he island for australia before the japanese military invade it gen macarthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior us president franklin d roosevelt dan oherlihy feeling that hell be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly together with his wife and young son did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war it was that reason his escape under fire from death or captivity by the japanese that drove gen macarthur to use all his influence to get fdr two years later to launch a major invasion of the philippians instead of the island of formosa to back up his promise to both the philippine people as well as the thousands of us pows left behind that hell return and return with the might of the us army  navy to back up his pledgebr br in the two years up until the invasion of the philippine islands gen macarther battered the japanese forces in the south pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of japanese troops into surrender the general did that suffering far less us military losses then any other allied commander in the war in the pacific br br it was in 195051 in the korean war that gen macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat after outflanking the advancing north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed with the invading us marines suffering less then 100 casualties back door or left hook invasion of inchon gen macarther feeling invincible sent the usun forces under his command to the very border along the yalu river of communist red china told by his subordinates that hes facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the us  un forces to ribbons the unstoppable wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the usun forces to retreat in the big bug out of 1950 with their very lives leaving all their equipment behind across the north korean border even abandoning the south korean capital city of seoul this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record in the korean war 1000 lives on the very first daynov 2930 1950of the communist chinese invasionbr br shocked and humiliated in what he allowed due mostly to his own arrogance to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres harry s truman ed flanders in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the korean peninsula for pres truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out like macarthur wanted him to against the red chinese this was the last straw on april 11 1951 pres truman unceremoniously relived gen macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the usun forces in korea pres trumans brave but very unpopular decision also by not going along with macarthurs total war strategy prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet unioncommunist chinas ally who at the timelike the ushad the atomic bomb pres trumans controversial decision to dump the very popular gen macarthur also cost him his reelection in 1952 with his polls numbers so lowin the mid 20s that he withdrewin march of that year from the us presidential campaignbr br in was gen macarthurs misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars with the horrors of a nuclear war now in 195051 a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out like gen macarthur wanted to against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the us ussr  red china but the entire world it was that important reality of future war that gen macarthur was never taught since the a and h bomb werent yet invented in west pointbr br back to 1962 we can now see that gen macarthur after finishing his commencement speech at west point had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as  since his retirement from the us military elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it one thing that gen macarthur was taught at an early age from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very lastnot firstresort in settling issues between nations in that its the soldiers who have to fight and die in it it took a lifetime with the advent of the nuclear age for gen macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a congressional medal of honor winner like himself really was
