since douglas macarthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other american not elected president he deserved a better film biography not that universals macarthur is bad its just not all it should have beenbr br oddly enough the potential was there from the very early star trek episode the corbomite maneuver 1966 to the recent hbo films something the lord made 2oo4 and warm springs 2oo5 director joseph sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go the producer frank mccarthy also gave us patton 197o the legendary jerry goldsmith scored both films and universal widely touted the fact that the film was four years in preparation and production yet for all of this macarthur is perfectly adequateand not much more than thatbr br the film begins in early 1942 shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby president franklin d roosevelt dan oherlihyto flee the philippines to avoid capture by the japanese thus this film omits br br · macarthurs birth in 188o in a frontier barracks in arkansas still subject to attack by native american tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bowsandarrows to thermonuclear weapons br br · his graduation from west pointfirst in a class of 95 br br · how he joined his famous father general arthur macarthur who had earned the medal of honor at missionary ridge in the civil war on assignments in japan china and most importantly in the philippines br br · his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into vera cruz br br · how he leaped about the trenches of world war one like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to brigadier general br br · his postwar service as west points youngestand most progressivecommandant br br · his participation in the courtmartial of billy mitchell in 1924 br br · his routing of the bonus marchers in 1932 br br · his efforts to sustain a woefullyunderfunded army as chief of staff in the early 193os br br · his retirement from the us army to become field marshal  of the army of the philippines br br · and the reactivation of his commission by fdr shortly before the outbreak of the second world warbr br all this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of macarthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by pt boatthus we know that general mac is a legend but not why nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to dugout dougand so patently unfoundedbr br the remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly his islandhopping hit em where they aint campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the filipinos i shall returnhis crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar japan then the difference of opinion with president harry truman a properly feisty ed flanders over the conduct of the korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to congress that old soldierssimply fade away after which he did just that all quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentarybr br sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval if macarthurs actions appear noble let them be presented as such if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment since joe sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audiences reactionsagain see warm springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspectivebr br and finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to midway released about the same time both films were relegated to television directorssargent in this case jack smight on midway and both have a madefortvlook even jerry goldsmiths march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his patton themejust another way in which a largerthanlife man is memorialized by a very ordinary filmbr br there was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that macarthur did what no military commander before him had done he won the peacebr br in the end macarthurlike so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it
