frank mccarthy who produced the academy award winning biographical film patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of americas fighting generals douglas macarthur gregory peck gives a strong characterization of the man his genius as well as his egotism with macarthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blendedbr br the whole story of douglas macarthur would be a six hour film or a tv miniseries it would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at west point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet it would talk about his service in the phillipines as a young officer his legend building bravery on the battlefields of world war i in france it would also have to tell about him firing on the bonus marchers of world war i veterans in 1932 probably putting the final kabosh on any chances president herbert hoover had of getting reelected during macarthurs last years he and hoover had penthouse suites at the waldorf astoria in new york city that must have been a subject they avoidedbr br this film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback the film opens with macarthur addressing the student body in 1962 as he speaks the words of the famous duty honor country speech macarthurs mind goes back to world war ii and his desperate struggle against the advancing japanese on the island of corregidor and the fields of bataan on luzon the film takes him through his struggle to win back the phillipines the occupation of japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by president trumanbr br macarthur as a film would not work at all if it wasnt for the portrayals of dan oherlihy and ed flanders as presidents franklin d roosevelt and harry s truman respectively its the part of the film i enjoyed the best seeing macarthur and his relations with both these menbr br fdr by oherlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd president roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake but he was the master politician of the last century note how he deals with macarthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same timebr br truman by flanders is as people remember him a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked macarthurs haughtiness from the gitgo of course its in the history books how truman relieved macarthur in 1951 for insubordination macarthur was insubordinate no doubt about itbr br yet i could write a whole thesis on the trumanmacarthur relations along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis ive always felt that fdr would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president thenbr br macarthur was also grandly eloquent and gregory peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield listen to peck at the japanese surrender at macarthurs farewell to the nation before the joint session of congress and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962 watch the newsreels and see if you dont agree
