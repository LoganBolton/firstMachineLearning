since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites the blurb i wrote for amazon is below and im just thrilled that its finally coming out on dvd on 101706  the films 25th anniversarybr br the last credit in this film explains its appeal  thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed a charming and witty romantic comedy it is a love story written to new yorkers peter bogdanovich is a native who can identify every location west 12th street the ansonia the old fao schwartz the plaza the roxy chez brigitte and city limits which was a country  western club one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well offscreen as they do on and this intimacy is clearly communicated i laughed i cried it was better than cats not only an ode to dorothy stratten it was also audrey hepburns last feature appearance she had a cameo subsequent to this film and her inner beauty seeps from the screen buy it make a big tub of popcorn and curl up with someone you love
