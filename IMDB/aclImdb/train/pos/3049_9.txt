when i was over at hollywood video i looked through their clearance out movies and there was demonicus for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off i saw it only once before and couldnt pass up this great deal the second viewing was much better than the first the box is so cool and the music is very good if you havent seen demonicus yet i recommend that you do or if you rented and hated demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind if you seen a copy at hollywood video for the price i got it for dont pass it up as it is a great dealbr br demonicus is well a very different but entertaining moviebelieve it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing itit has very low budget and actors im sure that nobody is familiar with we began the the video game uh i mean film with a guy and a woman some where in italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail roadtrain track tunnel and she says dont go in there and what does he dothe normal stuffhe didnt listen to her he goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named tyrannouswhere did the chair come from that tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the cauldron pot come fromso every cave is complete with a caultron pottyrannous is wearing his armorhelmetand has a weapon or twohe does the dumbest thing a person could dohe puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of tyrannous from there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real tyrannousbr br nowi said before its like a video gameits hard to explain but it just feels like itthe music even sounds like video gamesthe acting is really terriblethe actors say things like why is he doing thisoh he was nuts already and fine since hes nuts im going homealso the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a breakbr br this movie has some errors but it isnt a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see demonicus
