william h macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hitman and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents treads much of the same territory as tvs the sopranos in terms of the midlife crisis of a criminal theme here too he visits a shrink but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from brommel i look forward to what this guy directs next an excellent script and all around great performances macy is excellent as always this is probably his best role since fargo donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macys wife young david dorfman is excellent as macys bright and sensitive son many of his lines sound adlibbed and are wonderful even neve campell who i usually find abhorrent is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures macys eye all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath this film deserved a much wider release as i suspect it would have connected with audiences
