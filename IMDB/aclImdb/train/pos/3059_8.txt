writerdirector henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film panic from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast william h macy tracy ullman john ritter neve campbell donald sutherland barbara bain david dorfman brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly unfunny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally seebr br panic is the story of a hit man alex macy who actually works for his father sutherland he covers his true profession by doing mail order work by all appearances he and his wife ullman and their son sammy dorfman are a typical suburban family unhappy with his life alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ritter telling only his mother bain in the waiting room he meets a young woman campbell to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist when alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatristbr br this is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mothers knowledge who kills to please his father but also cant stand up to him and quit his rage is so deepseated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son  and its finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression when its time for panic to moves it does  quicklybr br panic doesnt seem panicked at all in fact it moves very slowly but it moves slowly not because its poorly made  the slowness is deliberate mirroring alexs own psyche slowly coming out of the fog by making a decision about sara the campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they dont jive and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche sammysbr br william macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeatedbr br this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater its too adult too small too subtle too characterdriven and too good
