what a surprising treat to come across on late television had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie i would have passed the idea of a movie about a hitmanseeinga shrinkwantingto leavethebusinessandfallinginlovesounds trite but the film works from the start of the movie its clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word the look and feel of the film is perfect dark but not obnoxiously sobr br aside from the hitman family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism macys character grapples with his marriage and his fathers control macy shows a repressed sadness and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural personal and lovingbr br this is one of the best movies ive seen in a while and i cant believe i came across it by accident on late night television
