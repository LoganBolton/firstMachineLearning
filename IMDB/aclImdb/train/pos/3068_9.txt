i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable well i paid to see it in a theatre and im glad i did because visually it was a striking film most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s except for the shrinks office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the neve campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed out early 60s ambience and the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating for a firsttime director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked plausibility so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride in terms of acting and the depiction of fatherson motherson husbandwife parentchild relationships the film was spoton william h macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late tony perkins if this and magnolia are any indication tracey ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving to me it was a threedimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as twodimensional of course donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals the depiction of the parents bainsutherland reminded me in an indirect way of vincent gallos buffalo 66 although toneddown quite a bit i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director he has the selfdiscipline of a 50s bcrimefilm director something ptanderson will never have yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention
