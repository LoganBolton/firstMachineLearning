the effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business albeit a unique one all brought to a head by or perhaps the catalyst of a midlife crisis are examined in the dark and absorbing drama panic written and directed by henry bromell and starring william h macy and donald sutherland its a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must of necessity at last be resolvedbr br 	alex macy is tired he has a loving wife martha tracey ullman a precocious sixyearold son sammy david dorfman a mail order business he runs out of the house as well as his main source of income the family business he shares with his father michael sutherland and his mother deidre barbara bain but hes empty years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist dr josh parks john ritter and to make matters worse or maybe better depending upon perspective in dr parks waiting room he meets a young woman sarah cassidy neve campbell whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember she quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her his whole life it seems has become a situation one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves he can deny his age and the fact that he has indeed slipped into a genuine midlife crisis but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own hes at a crossroads and hes going to have to decide which way to go and hes going to have to do it very soonbr br 	from a concept that is intrinsically interesting bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers that in real life there is no easy way out his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and moreover within any given family unit the film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny with irrevocable consequences and effects when youre growing up you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds ergo the midlife crisis or more specifically the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape its a powerful message succinctly and subtly conveyed by bromell with the help of some outstanding performances from his actorsbr br 	for some time william h macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business creating such diverse characters as quiz kid donnie smith in magnolia the shoveler in mystery men and jerry lundegaard in fargo and thats just a sampling of his many achievements at one point in this film sarah mentions alexs sad eyes and its a very telling comment as therein lies the strength of macys performance here his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed staring off into the darkness in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling not only with his immediate situation but with everything in his life that has brought him finally to this point in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt confusion and uncertainty all of which have been successfully suppressed until now all the things that have always been at the core of alexs life only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing demanding confrontation and resolution its a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute precision that makes alex truly memorable its a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate its a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors aroundbr br 	sutherland is extremely effective as well his michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real its chilling its frightening in fact to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain but a true personification of evil hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door which is what makes it all the more disconcerting and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly with a great performancebr br 	neve campbell looks the part of sarah but her performance as is the usual case with her seems somewhat pretentious although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film if only she would occasionally turn her energies inward it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters panic however is one of her best efforts a powerful film that in the end is a journey well worth taking 910 br br
