panic is a sneaky little gem of a film  you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize with great pleasure that henry bromell is a much better writerdirector than that br br the film builds slowly with one quietly devastating scene after another all enacted perfectly by william h macy donald sutherland neve campbell tracey ullman john ritter and the most remarkable child actor ive seen in a long time david dorfman as macys son who delivers his lines as if theyre completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind rich and rewarding this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled
