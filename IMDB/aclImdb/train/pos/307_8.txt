they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale it is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camps simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says howweird its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face
