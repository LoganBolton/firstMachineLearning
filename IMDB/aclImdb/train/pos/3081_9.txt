i borrowed slightly modified title from some other comment i have to say that as i usually dont like relationship series i really did liked this one great characters interesting and not cliché story good acting good and again not cliché which in case of dialogs is rather rare dialogs  it is really interesting how the characters cross paths with each other and sometimes knowingly sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives but unfortunately as we say in our country  do you know how do you recognize a good us series it is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season sure it isnt always true but
