i got hooked on this as apparently abc has licensed this show to pearl tv in hong kong it caught be my surprise as it was a break from listening to anything chinese but i started getting reeled in as the cast and the story lines are just nyc enough and thoughtful nothing too unbelievable though i think its very very stereotypical of them to write damien as a potential black man with a sheet that has been the most disappointing aspect the rest is great and im sad to learn on imdb that i cant look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the us im am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste but just as shows that show characters getting closer its probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks
