you probably all already know this by now but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on abccom ive watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show ever its a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled the actors that played laura whit carlos mae damian anya and omg steven caseman  are all incredible and so natural in those roles even the kids are great wonderful show so sad that its gone of course i wonder about the reasons it was canceled there is no way ill let myself believe that ms moynahans pregnancy had anything to do with it it was in the perfect time slot in this market ive watched all the episodes again on abccom  i hope they all come out on dvd some day thanks for reading
