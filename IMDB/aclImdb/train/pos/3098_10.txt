i loved this show so much and im so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too but just two stupid weeks thats terrible i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up it sucks bring it back abc has stupid shows like supernanny and whatnot but doesnt give time to good ones like six degrees if theyre complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was truly a good show something i could relate to and anticipated jj abrams delivered hes awesome i wish abc could just trust him enough to complete the story i loved the entire cast too i couldnt wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once everyones story is now left incomplete now ill never know if steven and whitney would get together or carlos and mae i wanted to see what would happen to laura or damien and everyone else this is really such a downer
