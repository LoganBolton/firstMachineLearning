along with brothers  sisters six degrees was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006 br br great cast all around but really enjoyed the work of campbell scott the comeback photog and hope davis recent widow of journalist killed in iraqbr br aside from the acting the writing was fresh and the acting superb the show was also shot in nyc the real city not the warner bros or some other studios backlot adding a secondary layer or realism br br i guess people are more interested in the latest survivor and other reality garbage too bad it didnt last
