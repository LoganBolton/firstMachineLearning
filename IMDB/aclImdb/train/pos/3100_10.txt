by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet the movie never and i do mean never lets up in action it may be mild action but its action once again every member of the cast fits perfectly the explosions were realistic the chase scenes were feasible and the fighting was incredible matt damon will forever be jason bournebr br all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception the action the stakes the plot how they do it i will never know i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies because if he hadnt done such a great job with the first movie we wouldnt have this one to talk aboutbr br so dont go see it in theaters go experience it in theaters if its still out where you live but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you
