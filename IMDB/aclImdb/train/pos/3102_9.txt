i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend and wow i had already seen the first two films and i liked them but ultimatum i lovedbr br matt damon plays jason bourne a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run trying to discover who he isbr br like i already said i loved this movie from start to finish no plot holes slow scenes everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films but in all senses it was much betterbr br best stunts car chases actors and effects ive seen in an action movie all summer surprisingly due to spiderman 3 pirates etc but i it wasnt just action in this film jason doesnt just kill and run he has a soul and the audience feels for him so drama is included but that doesnt slow it downbr br of all the threequels that came out last summer this was the best
