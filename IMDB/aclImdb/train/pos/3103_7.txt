perhaps we can arrange a meet  where are you now  im sitting in my office  i doubt that  why would you doubt that  if you were in your office right now wed be having this conversation facetoface br br bourne remains street tough and elusive only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy conversation is macho to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour its all about the actionbr br the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect there is no meeting of worlds  you are in it or just a superfluous bodybr br if the shaky cam doesnt annoy you too much enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going
