the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for superspy jason bourne a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics ultimatum has an 85100 on metacriticcom meaning its status is universal acclaim and for good reason the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossingbr br first i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy the two fancytitled prequels to ultimatum there may be three different movies but in reality they are all a continuance of one another missing one leaves you stranded and confused just like i was you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two but then the story will definitely lead to some confusionbr br if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy jason bourne is played very well by mattÂ…damon damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod but his work here is good enough to hold its own bournes adventures take place in many different cities the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him downbr br i wont go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies however it wouldnt hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience not every viewer is a diehard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development ultimatum wouldnt have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up frontbr br it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film the movie opened to 69 million and box office total now is up to 216 mil is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3 its the best action movie ive seen since live free or die hardbr br good damon is solid but not spectacular very smart movie bad story is like many others
