having not seen the films before and not being able to stand matt damon i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies br br however i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable br br fast fight scenes crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu the nearmisses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertainedbr br nevertheless several things really grated my cheesebr br firstly the fact that the film was just a series of bourne cia bourne cia bourne cia this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something very unrealisticbr br and secondly inevitably  the shaky camera it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class even the tutors seasick we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation but surely we wouldnt be shaking our heads that violentlybr br but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch but i didnt think it was the best film of the year despite being an entertaining piece of cinemabr br 810
