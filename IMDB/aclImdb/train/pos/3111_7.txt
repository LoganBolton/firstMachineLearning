he now has a name an identity some memories and a a lost girlfriend all he wanted was to disappear but still they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built now he wants some explanation and to get ride of the people how made him what he is yeah jason bourne is back and this time he s here with a vengeancebr br ok this movie doesnt have the most elaborated script in the world but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society of course like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90s the bourne suprematy is a superheroes story jason bourne is a captainamerica projectlike whos gone completely wrong in the first movie the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one he now fights against what he considers like evil after a person close to him has been killed his girlfriend in suprematy by them thats all a part of the superhero story including a character with realistic but still impressive  he almost invincible super powersbr br and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world theres no frontiers in the bournes movies characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye is as in the best seasons of 24 an american enemy whos beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him funny how mad patriots are now the n1 enemies of paranoiac hollywoods storiesbr br beside all those interesting thematics the movie isnt flawless  the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes but all that doesnt really matter for the bourne ultimatum is an action movie and the action scenes are rather impressivebr br everyone here is talking about the waterloo scene and the tanger pursuit and everyones right i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark visually inventive scenes lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on americans contemporary thematics  the bourne ultimatum is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick
