i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater id been waiting for this since before they started filming i wasnt disappointedbr br minor spoilers below br br overall it was good but it also lacked the continuity of the first two identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama this movie felt choppy at times the plotbuilding downtimes were slightly too drawn out that caused the following action to feel too freneticbr br camera speaking of frenetic the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me i know its has been talkedwhined about to nausea on the message board but it doesnt mean its not relevant all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie it is a cheap student director trick to make the film feel unsettled id expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids but not in this classy adult action series too much extreme closeup also do some framing get some interesting shots constant closeup feels like lazy directing to mebr br story the story was very confusing at first they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know youve missed some crucial information felt rushed or compressed for time reasons after you catch up however the story is quite good its enjoyable following leads along with bourne however i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy landybourne on the phone being in the middle of ultimatum thing it basically makes the movie a halfprequel i thought that was awkwardbr br castcharacters the star of the movie is the action obviously there are only two originals left bourne and nicky parsons them teaming up was kind of odd to me i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in unless i completely missed something they never even tell you why they teamed up the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet this felt like gilroygreengrasswhoever wanting to not leave open ends understandable but disappointing seriously damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy those scenes were phenomenal these assassins are as uninteresting as castel the first fella bourne fights in identity the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on clive owen was practically an afterthought thats a measure of strength for that first cast the second they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen not exactly equal this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later nothing against david strathairn scott glenn or albert finney but theyre not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long the acting was right onbr br as a whole it was successful felt like they wanted to get the series over with though if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts eliminated scott glenns part entirely zoomed out and taken the camera away from the seizure victim it would have been perfectbr br ending spoilerbr br i dont see why they leave bourne alive at the end it was my understanding this was the conclusion they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless i thought that was going to be it a full circle type of ending i did like nicky reacting to the news report thoughbr br spoiler specifics warning  quote from movie below br br bournes last line at the end look at this look at what they make you give quoting the first assassin he killed i loved that the final scene was great except that it was vosen strathairn that shot at bourne why would he do that just out for vengeance if he was angry enough to murder why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file that didnt make sense
