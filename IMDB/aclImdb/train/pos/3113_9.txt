the bourne ultimatum  jason bourne matt damon in his best role ever the newest spy kid on the block brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cias latest program blackbriar to make super assassins like himselfbr br i was so psyched for this one that i watched its predecessors yesterday and today identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak but still enjoyable link in the chain for the weakest plot and aside from a car chase which this films chase easily tops slight lacking in action and suspensebr br hoo boy does ultimatum have suspense even when you know bourne will escape the authorities and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept its still brilliant watching him do it its mindboggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in transformersbr br chalk it up to paul greengrass who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary even though hes filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than aweinspiring with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick a hardcover book ill never look at those the same way again and an electric fan dont ask the music also helped generate much suspense and there was hardly ever a moment to not nailbite overbr br the acting is good and the evolution of julia stiles character nicky put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity this longing of his for a real life could get boring and almost did in supremacy but just works better in ultimatum better script br br i am reminded of a scene in goldeneye the only good pierce brosnan bond film in which sean beans character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men hes killed bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers or at least made me consider the meaning of action without purpose life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources albeit resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anythingbr br sidenote its always bothered me that despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia interpol and the police nearly anywhere he goes that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports sunglasses maybe br br if you have a pulse and love action movies than bourne ultimatum is for you hell its probably the best action film to come out this year of course youd be a fool to see it without watching the others first it kind of drags a touch near the end but i almost feel tempted to overlook that this is the first 3 movie this summer to at least match if not exceed the original and that is saying somethingbr br a
