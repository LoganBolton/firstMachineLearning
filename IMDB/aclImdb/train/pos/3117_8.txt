i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy please oh please dont ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel just leave it alone rightmoving onas talented and versatile as matt damon isit seems as though he was just meant to play jason bournebr br if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies you will not be disappointed by the third installment it sticks to what works and adds a little more i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in identity and supremacy all mesh in ultimatum to finally paint the full picture of jason bournes troubled past the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street making it even more exciting for mebr br if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installmentsyou will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more im not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think ultimatum might just might have the edge when comparing the trilogy
