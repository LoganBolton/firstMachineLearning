this is the first 10 out of 10 that ive given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action  there isnt any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesnt try to please all sectors of the public ie theres no forced romancebr br i liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this onebr br warning  after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
