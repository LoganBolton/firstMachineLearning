im a belgian and grew up in the sixties most of the us series were shown over here original language with subtitles and batman was one of the first i was keen on unfortunately over here it caused a panic hysteria amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent geez compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays so because of my the overprotective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes  i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards still got them  to compensate i even got the view master slides i had an urge to see the caped crusader all kids need some kind of herobr br years later i finally got the chance to see the reruns as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously the tongueincheek acting would have escaped me when i wouldve watched it as a kid but i understood it at the age of 17 yeah ive watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they havent released the series on dvd to my knowledgebr br this evening i enjoyed return to the bat cave it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and insidejokes to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect they play themselves as they played their parts in the seriesbr br congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic feast im gonna watch it again my advice to all batman fans is see it  rent it  lend it from a friend  buy it  id never expect myself to rate this as 910 very well done
