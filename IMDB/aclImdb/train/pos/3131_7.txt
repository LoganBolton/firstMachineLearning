i really enjoyed this i got it thinking it was going to be a documentary but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek funbr br i think this has been well done pretty much an extended tv show into a film but due to the characters or rather original actors willingness to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style innocent waybr br if you are a fan of the original tv series then i am sure you will enjoy thisbr br q
