this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the bradys and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt  but also get to see them back in action filled with kapows and catwomen and the riddlers batman is back ina well told  tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series  but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that havent been heard in 35 yearsbr br kudos
