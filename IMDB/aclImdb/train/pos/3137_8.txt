this was basically an attempt to do the same thing with batman that was done with gilligans island in surviving gilligans island for those of you who missed it and shame surviving gilligans island full title surviving gilligans island the incredibly true story of the longest three hour tour in history was a special from a few years back where bob denver gilligan dawn wells mary ann and russell johnson the professor related the story of the shows creation cancellation rediscovery  rebirth along the way stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew it was very well done it was funny well cast and came across as a genuine document of the showbr br return to the batcave the misadventures of adam and burt is in a similar style the retelling of the history of the show the reenactments the general feel are all the same whats missing is the straightforward approach that surviving tookbr br in return adam west and burt ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited after being allowed to stay adam and burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show the legendary batmobile adam and burt decide to chase after it themselves leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show this eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the batmobile and whybr br choosing to use this conceit actually having a plot is the biggest letdown of this show unlike surviving return forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline the theft of the batmobile instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in the history of the show it is the historical sections that work the best the casting as in surviving is excellent jack brewer adam west and jason marsden burt ward capture the feel of the actors without looking too much like them brett rickaby frank gorshin bears a stronger resemblance to his subject but captures none of the late gorshins charm only his characterizations other actors portrayals are short and functional with none standing out as especially good or bad many of the stories have been told before but they mostly play out amusingly with only the occasional clunky presentation another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of lyle waggoners tryout for the part of batman the only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story this downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlesslybr br the main plot if that is what we must call it is of course ludicrous this is not really a fault in and of itself but its just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot especially in these kinds of things but we really get neither here the performances by west and ward seem somewhat flat even for them the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural again i think the comparison to surviving gilligans island can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback in surviving thats all it intends to be in return it tries to do double duty and unfortunately often fails gorshin and newmar do well although i agree with others that gorshin had not aged well and that newmar had  and whats waggoner taking to look that good but arent given enough to do again i think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen herebr br another odd point about return this special is about the batman tv series and its history yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie even the waggoner footage is technically movie footage if you know youre bathistory then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first only to be delayed in favor of the tv show when cbs needed to fill time fast so when waggoner and west were testing for the role it was for the movie not the tv show why return only uses movie footage is unclear it most probably has to do with rights issues but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know seeing julie newmar in the present but only footage of lee meriwether as catwoman in the pastbr br overall i liked the show mainly for the flashbacks i would have preferred the style used in surviving gilligans island but i can understand why theyd want a more storyoriented piece given the subject matter besides i like these people its nice to see them out and about still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there
