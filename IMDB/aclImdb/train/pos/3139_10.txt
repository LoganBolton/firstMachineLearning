there are many kinds of reunion shows one kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they havent played for twenty or thirty years these have mixed results return to mayberry despite some silliness was okay return to green acres as execrable eddie albert used a word for the script i wont repeat here but both it and the movie stink rescue from gilligans island filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways though the show itself was silly even from a gilligans island viewpoint in most cases the scripts are weak sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy its nearly always fatal for the characters to know theyre being funny new characters are introduced who dont fit the mix in the main these reunion shows are pretty weak a second sort of reunion show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around telling stories reminiscing interspersed with flashbacks from the shows then there are movies based on the shows which are rarely good and movies based on the history of the show the brady bunch has had both of these happen to it with various resultsbr br return to the batcave uses nearly all the above with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint which makes it the best of the reunion shows and has raised the bar for the othersbr br adam west and burt ward and summoned to a showing of the original batmobile while they are there the car is stolen br br the adam west of the movie is a man demented he called jerry his butler alfred he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage hes obsessed with being a crime fighter when in fact hes merely a washed up actor when the batmobile is stolen he not only believes its his duty as a crime fighter to recover it he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistantbr br the pursuit is largely loquacious with west and ward reminiscing about the old days it is broken by flashbacks with actors playing west and ward in the old days the modern scenes and the flashbacks both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself in wards book about his time on the show he spoke frankly about wests libido and also his being a skinflint west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit down to tips and bus fare the clues they follow the characters they meet even in flashback all fit the mentality of the old series and there are several homages including a fist fight with written sound effectsbr br the whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache there are also cameos by julie newmar looking like shes had one facelift too many and frank gorshin reminding us why he has such a cult following gorshin will be the riddler when jim carey his obvious successor is long forgotten the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climaxbr br this show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately there are few that can fit the pattern this show had actors replaying their old characters young actors playing a movie about the making of the show the actors west and ward reminiscing and a modernday movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west it has everything if you loved the old show this is the stopper on the bottle
