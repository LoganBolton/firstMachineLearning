lets face it the final season 8 was one of the worst seasons in any show ive ever enjoyed mostly ive never found dry spells to last a whole season but if you judge this show by the last season of course its going to come across as inferior that is an entirely unfair assessment because that 70s show was in its day a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there werent so different than we are here in modern timesbr br all right ignoring season 8br br topher grace stars as eric forman a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of donna laura prepon the feminist girl next door playing their friends danny masterson hyde mila kunis jackie wilmer valderrama fez and even ashton kutcher kelso give fantastic performances in almost every episode the best one is probably fez a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get what country is he from try to figure it out for another dimension of entertainment debra jo rupp and kurtwood smith are phenomenal as erics parents rupp as kitty is both formidable and sweet sort of like mrs brady meets marie barone while smiths red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone don stark and tanya roberts play very well opposite each other as donnas parents the chauvinistic but likable bob and the airheaded midge tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo a stoner who acts as a father figure to hydebr br apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the overthetop lessons that sometimes come and that deplorable final season 70s is a terrific show with amazing writing spoton direction and a feelgood vibe pulsing through every episode theyre all alright
