this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons the only reason that i give this show a 910 is because of the unfortunate final season the only good part of the final season was the finale my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to peoples imaginations often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the 70s it is a rare show in that i liked every character with the exception of the final seasontoo late to try to develop a new character and fez wasnt nearly as funny reds foot in your ass comments never got old nor did kelsos stupidity bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long too long even
