that 70s show is the best tv show ever period its up there with the andy griffen show saturday night live and the simpsons in my book that 70s show continued on for 8 seasons all of which focus around a group of teenagersyoung adults dealing with relationships separating from their parents and their overall futuresbr br the two main characters eric and donna are two teenagers living next door to each other they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is workingbr br two other characters red and kitty are erics parents red was in the service so he really pushes eric around kitty is just the opposite even though she drinks heavily she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care bob their neighbor is obviously donnas dad bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the shows story bob also annoys red to his full extentbr br the remaining character hyde kelso fez and jackie are erics friends they also play a major role in the shows storybr br well the first season is great this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other the first season is original funny and enjoyablebr br the second season is good although it isnt as good as the first it is a basic continuation of the first eric and donna are together and everything is working out greatbr br the third season is my favorite it went back and captured the first season feel and humor i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch making the show all that more fun to watchbr br the fourth season isnt near as good eric and donna arnet together in this one making the show slightly less pleasurable it is still funny although i didnt enjoy it as much as the previous seasonsbr br the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through it is the gangs senior year so that really helps with the story the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasonsbr br the sixth season is good for the most part it is extremely funny although it doesnt capture the feel that the other seasons did the gang is out of high school so i believe that it didnt hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did i also didnt like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to thembr br the seventh season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way although it didnt do it all the way i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others and the ending is greatbr br the last season flat out sucked eric wasnt in it which ruined it kelso wasnt in it for the most part either which didnt help i hated the eighth season up until the last episode i thought that the last episode was really good and a fitting ending to the seriesbr br so overall if you enjoy comedy give that 70s show a try they stopped making new episodes but it is still on tv a bunch i also recommend buying seasons 17 it is up to you if you want to buy season 8
