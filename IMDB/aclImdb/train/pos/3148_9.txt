i love this show period i havent been watching very long probably only about six months or so actually but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while i love all of the characters except i dont really care for donna im not completely sure why i justdont find her funny and i dont think laura prepon is a very good actress other than her i find the rest of the cast pretty good kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp who played erics parents were extremely funny topher grace is also a great actor unlike a lot of fans i did not completely hate the 8th season i still watch it and it does make me laugh but if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons itsnot good randy is horrible the finale was decent nothing amazing but good  i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave but oh well i have the fourth season on dvd and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd some of its most hilarious episodes in my opinion were dinedash grandmas dead redstacey and streaking but i love every episode ive seen so far which is most of them i think  910 stars i would definitely recommend it
