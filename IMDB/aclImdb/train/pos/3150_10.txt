i havent liked many tv shows post 1990 but that 70s show is great never seeing it during its first run thinking a gimmicky period piece i was wrong i started watching in reruns and the more i watched the more i liked now it is the only show premiering post1990 that i watch regularlybr br although that 70s show mimics some of the styles attitudes music and tastes of the 70s it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s it contains so much funny witty biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clich√©s by just being humorous the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchablebr br although a hilarious sitcom no matter what time period the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity but its the focus on universal issues family problems teen angst marital issues peer pressure dealing with all of them with comic aplomb that gives the show a mass appealbr br the shows center is one eric forman played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace eric is a superskinny geekylooking nonathletic teen and still comes off as supercool due to graces brilliant selfdeprecation of the character eric has 5 friends donna hyde kelso jackie and fez played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon danny masterson ashton kutcher mila kunis and wilmer valderama we get to see life in point place wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see donna a forwardthinking feminist is the object of erics affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity hyde is erics best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him hyde is the mellow zen cool one of the group and just sits back observes and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever jackie who starts out as kelsos girlfriend is a verbose selfabsorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group bc of kelso but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her and finally fez fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country we never know exactly where and he is a scenestealer i said good day you son of a btch valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasnt one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen his scenestealing moments often help make the show for mebr br the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be the gang repeatedly gets into trouble most of it on purpose they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other they hang out most of the time in erics basement plotting pontificating or just plain playing aroundbr br also figuring prominently in the show are erics parents the menacing commiehating red and the lovable happygolucky kitty played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp these 2 adults give the show a muchneeded mature pointofview and constantly berate and advise the 6 neer dowells red and kitty are ably supported by donnas parents the buffoonish bob played wonderfully for the full run by don stark and blonde bimbo daft midge the supersexy tanya roberts who was on the show for about half its run additionally for 3 full seasons erics sister from hell laurie played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrahfawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents sides kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps but unfortunately kellys personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the newbie didnt last thankfully and was gone after a few season 6 epsbr br sadly at the end of season 7 topher grace eric and early in season 8 ashton kutcher kelso left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be its last grace and kutcher returned for the series finale though giving the show a satisfying end br br a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor top notch supporting players were eternally high leo played to the hilt by tommy chong pastor dave roy the terrific comic jim gaffigan big rhonda mitch earl etc they also got legends marion ross happy days and betty white the mary tyler moore show to play red and kittys mothers respectively many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well from shirley jones partridge family to pamela sue martin nancy drew to charo to ted nugent to kiss it goes on and onbr br with great nostalgic 70s homages and references hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical takenoprisoners style of comedic storytelling that 70s show is a television classic
