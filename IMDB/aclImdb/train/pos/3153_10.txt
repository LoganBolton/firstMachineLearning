im gonna make this short and sweet because i dont think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique for me its possibly the funniest show everbr br you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out for example the way hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomesbr br its all round classic i mean the cast the writers the director its just a recipe for success one actor i think who always gets a hard time is ashton kutcher but i mean hes great in this show i dont think its possible for the the character kelso to have been played by anyone else it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid all the main characters are great and it wouldnt be a worth while review if i didnt mention the stone cold fox mila kunis now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show
