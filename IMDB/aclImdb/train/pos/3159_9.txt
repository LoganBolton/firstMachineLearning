 and the series lets you forget all that i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series born in 1958 i learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first postcollege graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979 the 70s were a truly dreadful time to be young  inflation competing for afterschool minimumwage jobs with laidoff thirtysomethings dreadful music worse clothesbr br the funny thing is this series doesnt ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70s look fun even for those of us old enough to know better it manages to look the 70s directly in the face  complete with timeauthentic clothing  and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times then there are the parents the two young lovers in the show  eric forman and donna pinciotti  truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions erics parents red and kitty are not exactly june and ward although they are conventional for the decade they represent what happened when the 60s finally reached the suburbs during the 1970s donnas parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy erics friends fez kelso and jackie round out the group representing nerdiness wellmeaning incompetence and snobbishness respectively hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents i highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of eric
