i cant believe we dont have that 70s show anymore i have all 8 seasons of that 70s show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day its nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the reruns i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunionlike maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldnt that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years
