this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures br br loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences ken rock nroll fanatic marries kyoto a japanese girl so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires the marriage is only expected to be temporary that is until kyoto gains legal status again but ken who seems to be lost in every relationship takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out this despite his friends urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of thatbr br but kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing and doesnt expect to be married to ken all that long not only that she is homesick and wants to return to japan its sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that except the one time he thinks hes found someone to feel that way about the girl isnt expecting to stay that long its not that she doesnt like ken its just that shes used to a whole nother way of life she says i cant tell him the way i feel in english and ken cant tell me the way he feels in japanese its a rather sad love story with a killer 80s technonintendo soundtrackbr br i picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films tokyo pop and for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time check out tokyo pop a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band except its a movie with a happy endingbr br
