i rented this some years ago the video store had only vhs at the time straight to video was hitting its strides you know where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful filmsi didnt know what to expect other than what was printed first thing i thought while watching was what the hells wrong with the soundobviously there was no dialogue dubbing words echoed so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attentionmind you theres no shakespeare herejust simple talk the story is simple enough boy meets girl etc what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didnt seem like caricatures written into the storybut rather nonactors plucked temporarily from their real jobsuniforms included all the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is afterthen see that there are no attempts at cheap humorpeople hurting their privatesusing vulgarities this couldnt have hurt the marketing there was something honest about it i thought if theyd have a bigger budget then it would have been better which im sure they considered dailybut they went ahead and made it this i felt was what independent filmmaking is all aboutthe word indy is thrown around as if its a genrehathats funny
