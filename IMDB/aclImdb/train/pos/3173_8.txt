an imagination is a terrible thing to waste  especially when you have talented actors writerdirector jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist br br anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry weve all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a mans head these are only snippets of whats in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
