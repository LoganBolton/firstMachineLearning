i happened to catch this film at a screening in brooklyn  its difficult to describe the plot it has a lot of wacky characters but lets just say id have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest i wouldnt know where to begin even the peripheral roles are well written and well actedbr br there are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable it has a few devices that pop up and add another hilarious layer it is refreshing to watch not some recycled stuff id seen many times before if this film could reach a wider audience im certain it would be a real crowdpleaser the story is so original and heartfeltbr br theres a lot here to like funny backstories mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion cross eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart its a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout definitely worth seeing
