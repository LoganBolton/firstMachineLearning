who made this film i love this film somebody has a wacky sense of humorbr br this zany surreal style of film making is appealing but it is hard to create  or easy to forget  that substance and characters who actually have souls are what give such a film depth without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas who cares it may get laughs but it goes through you like a halfgood hamburgernextbr br crosseyed may not intend to change anybodys life but i appreciate the depth and substance they sneak up on you i started this film thinking oh i get it  indie comedy  off the wall  gonzoyup and it is that  but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out in this sense the film breathes it makes propositions that give pause  if youre available to see them  and then of course it goes on its insanely merry waybr br you will miss the point if you dont sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points of this moviebr br crosseyed isnt perfect but smart people made it i want morebr br the dining room scenes are an absolute hootbr br put on your seat belt
