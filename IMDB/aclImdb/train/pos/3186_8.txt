i find this movie very enjoyable the plot is simple and easily digestible the humour is light and clean and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out turns out to be very nice the performance of the female lead is admirable her portrayal of an innocent naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to davids sophisticated role was very charming i also find veras dancing very very well done i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlesslybr br for those who have had enough of profanityfilled movies of today you will enjoy this movie thoroughly
