a few years ago i bought several 1 dvds that contained two movies each one of them had three broadway girls an alternate title for the greeks had a word for them and this one happy go lovely its basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaires limousine veraellen is that dancer andwow what legs ceasar romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks shes dating the millionaire whose car i just mentioned and david niven is that rich guy who when looking for veraellen is mistaken for a reporter whos supposed to interview her but gets stalled by romero what ive just mentioned may be confusing but mostly makes sense if youre willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite ms veraellen romero can be a bit frantic here but niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout the print i saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that its in public domain and veraellen does pretty well with her lines since shes not really an actress so on that note i highly recommend happy go lovely for movie buffs who love oldfashioned musical comedies
