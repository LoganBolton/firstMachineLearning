i was having just about the worst day of my life then i stumbled on this cute film watched it and now im ready to go out  kiss a streetlampbr br i have to admit i only watched it for 2 reasons veraellens legs but its really so much more the plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven its almost like a shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings and of course theres also veraellens legsbr br the only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version i purchased the 100 family classics collection by mill creek entertainment doesnt have the best video quality and ive heard the same about the alpha release the brightness and contrast are a bit too high so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when vera is dancing in a white dress but i suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your tv set to compensate i can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in 51 the stage sets costumes  colours are otherwise dazzling  delightfully creepysort of in a cabinet of dr caligari veinbr br as far as the romance goes this is just perfect not sappy not contrived not melodramatic just 100 ahhhhhh too bad you poor schmucks your miserable lives will never be as charming as this har har har wait what am i laughing at my life sucks just as bad as yours oh hell time to watch this movie again
