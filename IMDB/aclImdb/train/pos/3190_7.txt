this is your standard musical comedy from the 30s with a big plus that it features some well known 30s actors in small fun cameosbr br there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and noworries overall kind of atmosphere with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it appereantly its a cinderella story but i most certainly didnt thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the hollywood studiosbr br of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel  hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines its like watching a movie and getting a laurel  hardy short with it for free also laurel  hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson without a mustache this time as the director of the shortbr br its certainly true that all of the cameos and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main characterbr br the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwisebr br 710
