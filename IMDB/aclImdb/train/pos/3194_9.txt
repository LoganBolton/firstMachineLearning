there has never been anything like it thats for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about groovin gary utah crossdressing sensation it is very selfconsciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance hes trying to atone for his sins  yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired  through correction commentary and convention reclaiming such hollywoodnarrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending two different ones with a telling adjustment in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies  but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and retelling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesnt miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets
