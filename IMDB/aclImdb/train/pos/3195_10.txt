the beaver trilogy is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made i was lucky enough to catch it along with a qa session with director trent harris at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trents website this movie has to be seen to be believed i sincerely recommend searching for trents name on the web and then buying the film from his site hes an incredibly nice guy to boot dont get confused the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trentbr br after having seen the trilogy a few times i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version its like a tryout version for the crispin glover orkly kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if youre a penn fan than it being a good video penn is pretty funny though and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty bw videobr br this is probably also one of crispin glovers best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin gary once you see this film youll never get garys nervous laughter out of your head ever again
