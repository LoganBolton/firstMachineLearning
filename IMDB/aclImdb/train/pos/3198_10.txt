this is how i felt while watching this film i loved it it was hilarious but i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebodys psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point a friend put it this waybr br i feel like we broke into somebodys house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledgebr br another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film groovin gary the original beaver kid is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby tv station in the hope of getting on film  and he certainly does though not perhaps as he initially expected with high hopes of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has organised in his home town  headlined by his own drag act olivia newtondon br br director trent harris does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs over two subsequent reinterpretations into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town america harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town america the cult of celebrity and the exploitative practices of the film and television industrybr br both sean penn and grispin glover pull out stunner performances a young sean penn is the most evocative  so closely does he follow the actual gary footage but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way harris wants it to gobr br in the end the wideeyed naivety the original gary is what moved me  when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situationbr br a film not to miss i have not seen anything else like itbr br jacob
