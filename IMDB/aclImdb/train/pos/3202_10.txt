i cant understand why many imdb users dont like this movie why they think its sooooo bad etc its not worse than anything else out there personally i think soldier is a great movie far better than most other films in the same genrebr br reasons why i liked soldier kurt russel connie nielsen jason scott lee the script david webb peoples great visual effects and the directing paul andersonbr br i even think that this is the best work ive seen from director paul anderson who has previously directed the entertaining mortal kombat and the not so entertaining event horizon
