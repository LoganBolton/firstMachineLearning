i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big arthouse hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandalcausecelebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court whats potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of whats revealed in the sex or nudity the directoractor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but its always moreso an intellectual expression than very lustlike but the daring of the attempt at a pure metafilm while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country ie usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heatedup politically at least thats part of sjomans aim here br br like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hotcold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialistwannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and trains sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film theres even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this theres a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey im the director playing the director bitbr br at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lenas father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes its impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary filmwithinafilm and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasiguru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesnt feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerbr br if i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isnt entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clich√©s borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsbr br and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldnt be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage id even go as far as to say its influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avantgarde or metafilmmaking if its not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as wr or last tango its close behind
