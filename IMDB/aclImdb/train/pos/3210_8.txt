soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the sacarstic cynical humour like that in paul verhovens starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comicbook atmospherebr br one particular triviabit stands out for me  todd has the names of several spacewar campaigns tattood onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate for the oblivious ones out there tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy battys elegiac last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgicbr br ill give this one 3 out of 5
