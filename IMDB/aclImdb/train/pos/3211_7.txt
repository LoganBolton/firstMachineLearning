this movie is ok if you like mindless action corny acting and a very small plot the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director ofevent horizon the costumes are like something from a mad max movie none of the soldiers talk so others tell them what to doit eventually end up as a big shootem up movie with explosions all the place i personally liked russell better in tango and cashescape from lanew york and executive decision it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie
