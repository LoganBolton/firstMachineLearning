ive watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasnt as successful commercially or artistically as it should have been and discovered considerable artistic meritwhich may ultimately have been its commercial undoingbr br first of all this movie attempts serious sciencefiction social commentary more than actionadventure there is action in it but thats not really what its about if you focus on that youll end up with as others have noted a bad aliens clone but again thats not what its aboutbr br the movie is really about todds kurt russell transformation from human to nearmachine and back to human mostly back but because its not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking and largely without broad expressions and he really does a wonderful jobit can take two viewings to appreciate itbr br the surrounding social logic is flawed and its never adequately explained whether todds ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound humanness or what but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russells easy to underestimate talent
