kurt russell is so believable and the action so nonstop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honesttogoodness important themes overcoming fear of the stranger learning to rise above early conditioning the strength that love and friendship can bring etc in the storyline this is so very rare for a guys action flick that even i who thinks most aa is violent pap liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i knowits a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest actionadventure box office hits  it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly nonstop action moments im afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multilayered multithemed beauty or not care about it this film could convert anyone who avoids aa as mindless violence if a guy takes his lady or rents it or sees it in a cable listing to see this film hell be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks
