nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video scifi movie thats been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russells careerbr br i have my reasonsbr br firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of russells interpretation of todd the eponymous soldier im going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting ive seen russell pull off todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd  this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is nowbr br the portrayal is spot on todd is withdrawn uncommunicative and a loner he suffers from irrational anxiety  keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger his hyperfocus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within  there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed not cleaning up the cut or the blood many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote  not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables hes preparing and the food that will be eaten laterbr br todds dialog is spartan to say the least  the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence fear and discipline we are told always fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform tactically the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsens sandra  but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human whos only experience of an embrace is in combat  the trembling represents him suppressing his fight  flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled his movement and vision restricted  fear and discipline indeedbr br then there is the subtext of his abandonment twice in fact  so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when theyve served their terms 40 of the unemployed are exmilitary in our world in his it can only be worse russell quickly picks up the mantle of maces responsibility to his wife and child  desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high likelihood of his deathbr br then there is the military subtext too  the conflict between buseys church and the hotshot from hq mekum mekums new men are faster stronger more accurate and aggressive any one of them could pound todd into the ground  but its not about the tools you have its how you use them an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit  sent in without support cover or reconnaissance it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadershipbr br there are many other subtle themes when a film is shot and scripted so minimally it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you
