i dont know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterworkbr br the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you dont like the process of film dont like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingbr br this isnt a film that you will want to watch to unwind its a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and carebr br summaries may contain a spoiler or twobr br the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions arent realbr br the film is like many films in onebr br 1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lenabr br 2 a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people hes supposed to work withbr br 3 the film that vilgot is making its about a young woman named lenaie 2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie 1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatbr br the magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellowblue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrativebr br another thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all ill try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquebr br think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete talebr br think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didnt see that is a complete tale on its ownbr br essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysbr br it wasnt until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowbr br i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmbr br thanks for your time
