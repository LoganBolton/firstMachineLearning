the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the thematic conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity and the physical conflict between todd and his bioengineered replacement both sequences are quite gripping in different waysbr br peoples screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs halfway through the movie which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action rompbr br nonetheless kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very littlebr br not a great film but one worth seeing
