ok basically this is a popcorn scifi movie but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence you can count about 10 clich√©s that the film is building up to but it only delivers on about three of them and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasnt assumed that you are an idiot kurt russells acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding recommended if youve just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith
