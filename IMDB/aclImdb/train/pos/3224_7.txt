i watched this movie expecting what i got good scifi cowboy stuff what really surprised me was that kurt russell did such a great job with an extremely limited rolebr br imagine trying to act under these two restraints you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a hardass military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions howzat kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and ducttaped in spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed russell pulls off an incredible characterization his robot becomes human in spite of the constraints great jobbr br as usual jason isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villainthe one youd love to see drawn and quartered connie nielsen was sweet soft motherly and gorgeous im not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take ones eyes off her unfortunately gary buseys role was too small and limited br br much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a scifi comic book feeling i dont see whats wrong with a few weaknesses by the end of the story the good guy wins and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction yesbr br the sort of feeb who thinks that russell didnt do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point
