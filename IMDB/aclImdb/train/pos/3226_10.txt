i dont remember this film getting a cinema release over here i only saw it when it came onto cable the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an offworld community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feelsbr br seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space and would have been happy if it wasbr br im certainly happy it wasnt  kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple the scene where hes sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slowmo replays detracts from the momentbr br this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner alien silent running logans run or thx1138 were however it is unfortunately the nearest ive seen to it in a long timebr br he changes in the movie to a believable degree he doesnt crack arnie one liners he doesnt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy endingbr br thats why this film didnt do well it didnt follow formula and among a 1825 year old target american audience thats unforgivable as it was wasnt what they expected to seebr br fear and disciplinebr br always
