david webb peoples meets paul andersonif it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it isbr br peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong the value of life etc he covered these issues in bladerunner unforgiven and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those linesbr br paul andersons first successful movie was a violent thriller not surprisingly so have all of his other movies and here is a violent thriller with moral implicationsbr br peoples script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life they are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead there he must cope with a group of refugees some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here but thenbr br the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people big violent loud action ensues and peoples script turns into an anderson actionfest it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then i expected entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thoughtprovoking and exciting once the action starts 710br br rated r a lot of violence
