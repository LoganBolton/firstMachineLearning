ok so soldier isnt deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyablebr br the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnies in the t films and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the samebr br so to the film itself a reasonable usbrit cast are able to flesh out this little story not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace lovinggulliblecowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each otherbr br kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career unlike maybe escape from la  sequels are such fickle creatures sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble scifi lineage and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badlybr br if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance i dont think you will be disappointed
