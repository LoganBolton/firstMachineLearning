soldier isnt a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised mebr br first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didnt love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watchbr br second im a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth  the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero its not an award winning role but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialogbr br third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isnt iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genrebr br if you havent seen it and you like scifi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice just dont expect the next bladerunner
