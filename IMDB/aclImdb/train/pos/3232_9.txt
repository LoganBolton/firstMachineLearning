went to see this finnish film and ive got to say that it is one of the better films ive seen this year the intrigue is made up of 56 different stories all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town the stories come together very nicely in the end reminding perhaps a bit of the way tarantinos movies are made most of the actors performed very well which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala the lead actress and juha kukkonen i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about sanna her name as you might have noticed in my review  is not heikkil√§ but hietala
