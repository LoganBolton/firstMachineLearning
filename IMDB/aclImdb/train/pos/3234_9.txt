i thought it was an extremely clever film i was very pleased with it and truly couldnt ask for more i actually own the film because i didnt return it to someone which i should do but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it also the fact i dont own too many foreign films and this is a first now i personally love finnish stuff so that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it but overall its worth watching however if youre not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit then this film is not for youbr br 910 for sure
