why do i like disorganized crime so much why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie its kind of hard to explain but ill give it a try first of all its very funny indeed  in contrast to what lots of official reviews want you to believe but then again that depends entirely on your sense of humour so there is no sense in arguing about that often the humour is in the dialogue and often it is situational comedy there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck when the farmer drops them they just stand there by the road covered all over with cow s or whatever they are totally unnerved then realizing the humour of the scene they one by one start laughing about themselves and ruben blades as carlos looking and certainly smelling terrible nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again which leads to the second point the acting fred gwynne lou diamond phillips william russ ruben blades and corbin bernsen okay the latter overdoes it a bit at times all fit and play their parts beautifully  in fact you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film thirdly there is the plot  jim kouf the director and screenwriter is very laidback he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves more often than not there is no real action and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people  who attempt to rob a bank although their boss bernsen does not seem to turn up  grumble about each other and eventually grudgingly like each other the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot  totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details incidentally the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across because it perfectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way therefore take my advice watch this film but if you dont chuckle grin or smile during the first 10 minutes forget it  its not your type of film ps the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay  if you happen to know how do tell me
