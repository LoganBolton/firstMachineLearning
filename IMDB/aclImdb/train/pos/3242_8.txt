i saw this movie with my dad i must have been pretty young around 15 it was on star movies one afternoonthe movie started a bit vaguely but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score it really caught pace after the first half hourbr br all the actors are great especially blades and lou diamond i guess its the ensemble they just play so well together i can watch this film anytimei think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilariousbr br a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon
