i couldnt agree more with nomad 7s and i a hvrs comments a perfect laid back sunday morning movie the humor is subtle exact opposite of slapstick as one misguided commenter notedbr br but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previewshbo maybe had never heard of it previously dont know why it wasnt marketed that well  when dvds were released en mass it was one of the first movies i replaced a great combination of cast and writing plus the back drop of montana wilderness doesnt hurt things either beautifulbr br its probably not the type of comedy for everyone but what is if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley this probably wont be your cup of tea this movie needs your full attention the humor is mostly in the dialogbr br i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off im going to loose it ed oneills face is priceless recommended 110
