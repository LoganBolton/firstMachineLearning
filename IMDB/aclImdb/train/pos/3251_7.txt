yet another remake of fistful of dollars sergio leones remake of kurosawas yojimbo suggested by the novel red harvestbr br this one is strictly a bmovie taken as that it is rather enjoyable the direction is crisp the acting full of verve the limitations of its directtovideo photography wellhandledbr br the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the fistfulyojimbo plot to a subplot from leones once upon a time in the west although leone directed both fistful and west his motivations behind the two films couldnt be anymore different the man with no name eastwood is a borderline sociopath with a soft spot for broken families harmonica chaeles bronson is obsessed with his own broken family and obsessed with revenge these two characters would not have had much to do with each other in order to bring them together gun crazy has to twist its plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story were actually followingbr br but this is a bmovie after all and filled with action and silliness its entertaining on that level just dont expect anything more
