ive just seen this movie for the second time on television its lovely warm sentimental very very romantic ive rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another cybill shepherd ryan oneal robert downeyjr and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable br br the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping when harry met sally sleepless in seattle and the high gimmick sorts of movies like big back to the future peggy sue got married i hate to say this because this cast was superb and id never change any of them but i think it didnt succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan tom hanks michael j fox and kathleen turner at the time the movie was madebr br  its not superbly written  eg the characters lines are not particularly memorable yet its executed to perfection br br the romantic yearnings are truly palpable the feeling of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated loves timelessness and allencompassing sweep the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection are so touchingly delivered again and again you will find yourself moved actually a comparable movie is made in heaven the same romantic yearningbr br do see this  its lovely
