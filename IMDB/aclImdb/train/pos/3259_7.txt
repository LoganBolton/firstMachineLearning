this isnt the best romantic comedy ever made but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable its directed in an oldfashioned way and that works fine cybill shepherd as corinne isnt bad in her role as the woman who cant get over her husbands death she has a sexy maturity but i cant say much for ryan oneal as philip because he is at best nondescript he may be adequate in the role but thats not good enoughbr br however i get the feeling that some of the characters particularly alex and miranda are not written with enough indepth thought we dont know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick and the writers dont tell us much beyond what happens but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a freshasadaisy sweetness to brighten it up and robert downey jr is so charming that he melts the screen even his smile is infectious and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenesbr br anyway this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way why not give it a trybr br
