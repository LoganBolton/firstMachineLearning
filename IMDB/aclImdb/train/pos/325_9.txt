this is a great film  esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the 1960s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching  theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time
