people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i laughedbr br only once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14br br and i wasnt old enough to understand that it wasnt meant to bebr br taken seriously there were quite a few scenes that were meantbr br to be funny but i cared too much about the characters to laugh atbr br thembr br i suggest that you watch this film next time youre falling in lovebr br and try to take it seriously i think youll find that despite a few sillybr br flaws its one of the most moving love stories youve ever seen
