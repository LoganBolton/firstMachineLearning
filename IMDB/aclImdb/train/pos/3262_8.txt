i dont think i could have enjoyed it more though certain things were disturbing im not going to say what if you havent seen ityoull have to find out for yourself at any rate what movie can lack with robert downey jrs puppydog eyes allinall the plot was developed sufficiently nothing seemed too rushed as movies like this tend to be the characters were likeable and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it the idea overall is that the story is very well tied together even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactoryby matter of opinion but like i said before its hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr
