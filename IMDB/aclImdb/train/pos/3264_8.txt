what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was he could take a light script and with the right casting and editing put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end you really want to know how things are going to work outbr br the script is perfect for cybill shepherd who at the time needed to capitalize on her moonlighting success for the new generation who was fortunately for her probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start in this film shes every bit back in form as a stillpining widow living vicariously through her daughter mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with fried green tomatoes two years later she may have looked too young for the role but that works well for the way the story unfolds this is her film but she doesnt overstep her bounds as a leadbr br shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point and theres ample support from ryan oneal in his best role in years and christopher macdonald mastersons natural charm pretty much coasts on its own either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every wordbr br ardolino makes good use of his casts sex appeal the same way he did with dirty dancing but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room use your best judgment theyre your parents after all i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as wellbr br again credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze where are they now ardolinos next film would be the phonedin sequel to three men and a baby but his final theatrical release sister act would finally give him the ninefiguregrossing smash hit he deserved mr ardolino your cinematic touch is missed
