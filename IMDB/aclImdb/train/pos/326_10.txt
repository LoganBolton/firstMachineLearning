jag är nyfiken  yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful selfaware explorative dont expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid60s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest socialpolitical documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians eg olaf palme at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lenas life  her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person  complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sjöman and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish i think sjöman may have had something similar in mind while jag är nyfiken  yellow may not be everyones cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic
