coming from the same director whod done candyman and immortal beloved im not surprised its a good film ironically papierhaus is a movie id never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s  partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades not talking about iranian or swedish cinema here the acting is not brilliant but merely solid  unlike what some people here claim they must have dreamt this wondrous acting much like anna the story is an interesting fantasy that doesnt end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the individuals interpretation and theres nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids film and horror with effective use of sounds and music i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movieclich√© ultrashybutsecretlybrilliant socialoutcast girl but a regular normal kid very refreshing i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfitlike childhoods into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly lonely childhood as if thats all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential the scene with anna and the boy snogging for quite a stretch was a bit much  evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement  considering that she was supposed to be only 11 but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed i have no idea why they didnt upgrade the characters age or get a younger actress it was quite obvious that burke isnt that young why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence dilute the realism ill never know
