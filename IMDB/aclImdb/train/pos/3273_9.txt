im giving it only 9 out of 10 because i need to view it again in a more current mindframe to have a fresh perspective what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when i watched it i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day probably 1990 or so i might have even recorded it but that recording is long gone im surebr br i wrote to greencine to try and get this title in they currently dont carry it i hope i can find it at a local video storebr br i would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere its interesting at the very least if you enjoyed movies such as edward scissorhands beetlejuice gummo or anything sort of strange and along those lines try this one out
