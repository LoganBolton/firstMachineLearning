this is one of three 80s movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva a movie horribly overlook due to salvas legalsexual problems another would be camerons closet which strikes me as somewhat underratednot great but not nearly as bad as the reviews ive seen paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think i mean 10 years after ive seen it and i still give it some pause whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether
