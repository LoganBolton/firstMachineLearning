this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would for adults the idea of a childs drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say shes really exploring her subconscious just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep the bit that gives me goosepimples is when her dad is in the paper house and chases her the only thing i cant stand is that it was marketed as a horror filmit really isnt if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use then watch paperhouse
