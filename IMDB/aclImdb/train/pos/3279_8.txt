im glad that this is available on dvd now this film is an excellent example of the triumph of content  style over emptyheaded flashing lights  constant loud noisesbr br essentially if you have a short attention span or lack the wit  imagination to engage with literary narrative you wont like this film the reasons for this are quite simple but unfortunately rarely achieved matthew jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of catherine storrs novel marianne dreams successfully to a screenplay an unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly knowbr br the casting is excellent allowing director bernard rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now they indulge in the craft of acting i know i know actors doing their job  acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases explosions  fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat but it does actually happen in this filmbr br this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker  not the spoonfed tabloid reader  apart from a solid script direction  acting it relies on atmosphere suspense  implied horror if it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of paper house is more in the vein of sophocles than tobe hooperbr br in conclusion then if you like lots of loud noises explosions constant cuts  bright flashing colours youd be better off watching transformers but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful  evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing
