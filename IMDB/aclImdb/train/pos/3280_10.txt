ive only ever seen this film once before about ten years ago i bought the dvd two days ago and after watching it i think it is even better than i remembered it to bebr br paperhouse is much more than just a horror it had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it i especially thought charlotte burke was really excellent here its such a pity that she hasnt done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across especially at the end when she realised that although marc had died she knew he was going to be alrightbr br several scenes did make me jump which is a rarity for me in modern horror films most notably the scene in the bathtub the scene where annas father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dustbr br all in all an excellent and very moving film
