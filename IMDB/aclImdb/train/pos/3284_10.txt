my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcocks psycho i was very scared and deeply disturbed i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way but none where satisfactory amongst those tried and failed were the birds night of the living dead the silence of the lambs the blair witch project ring the evil dead the sixth sense 28 days later the texas chainsaw massacre halloween near dark alien peeping tom the cell rosemarys baby dont look now witchfinder general friday the 13th and the omen that should confirm i was desperate long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse br br paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own called marianne dreams paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films but they didnt tell me about the link between book and film i discovered the truth while on the internet i bought the film later that daybr br i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not it was the answer to my prayers marianne is renamed anna in the film but most of the original story is the same one day in school anna draws a house in her scrap book nothing remarkable about that then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house and i mean genuinely unnerving more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld eg an apple tree anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house obligingly anna draws in a lighthouse a place to go to but still the problem remains mark cant walk so anna decides to draw her father in she gets her pencil out and gets too work but the outcome is deformed and unsettling anna particularly dislikes his eyes quote he looks like madman so anna tries to rub him out and start again but the pencil proves indelible that means nothing can be rubbed out then anna loses her temper and crosses out her fathers eyes i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash actionbr br paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset but i have found what i was looking for after 2 years the question is how dose the compare with psycho answer 1 the old dark house 2 psychological parental fears 3 a genuine shock 4 and very scary music
