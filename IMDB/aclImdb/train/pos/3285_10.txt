anna charlotte burke develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation a bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and its inhabitant marc who cant walk because anna didnt draw him any legs are inhabitants of this purgatorylimbo world anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure whats what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and marc there foreverbr br wow is a good word to sum up bernard roses brilliantly haunting and poetic paperhouse a film that is so simple that its damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget while you may find this puppy in your horror section its anything but its more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by its cast in particular charlotte burke and elliot speirs marc and yet its not a childrens movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with paperhouse stays away from trying to explain its more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination theres much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with its very own sense of reasoning as the story unfolded i was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eyebr br bernard roses visuals are brilliant here hes able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of its parts the acting is of young charlotte burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well unfortunately shes not graced the screen since a much deserved burnout central award only seems proper for that performance toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but i was easily able to overlook it i wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect the movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover its a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised
