put quite simply this film is terrifyingbr br it starts off simply looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror filmbr br dont expect gore or zombies this is psychological and just as he would also do in candyman bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believedbr br each time you watch this film you realise more about whats happening and about how the two worlds in this film interconnectbr br drawings have never been scarier
