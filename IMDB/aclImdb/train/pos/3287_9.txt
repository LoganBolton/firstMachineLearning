my friend and i picked paperhouse out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the horror section neither of us had heard of it but the blurb on the box was really promising and the movie didnt disappoint though i still probably wouldnt call it a horror movie exclusivelybr br 11year old anna madden draws a house and visits it in her dreams she is definitely asleep when shes seeing the house but its so real in a sense that its almost like a completely separate reality which in view of later events doesnt seem like a far cry from the truth anyhow she finds she can add to the house its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture br br while this is going on anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing on top of that she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches though one gets the impression theres actually more to the story than thatbr br ok so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough but frankly theres something really menacing about it the dreamworld is eerily surreal  the house for instance is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate worldongoing dreambr br one of the things anna adds to the house is a boy mark who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about im not giving that away you know from the moment he appears that its the same kid in reality mark cant walk due to an illness in annas drawingworld he cant walk because she didnt draw him any legs she blames herself for his reallife illness and tries to rectify the situation but everything starts getting really weird she even brings her absent father into the drawing with disastrous results the bits with the father are really terrifyingbr br i dont want to give anything away so ill stop there there seems to be a lot going on in this film im sure youll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it is it a simple a story as it seems or are there actually layers of meaning i dont know but either way its quite fascinating there was a nightmare on elm streetish quality about it in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect i love things like thatbr br my only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times but didnt im satisfied with the ending it had some of you sensitive types might want to have kleenex handy though it really could have a variety of conclusions anyway it doesnt exactly feel drawn out once its actually over but while youre watching and it keeps fading back in its a little nerve wrackingbr br still paperhouse is a really good film its well done and acting especially charlotte burke as anna is top notch burke who has never before or since appeared in a film is a real gem i dont know why she never went onto do anything else but either way shes really convincing and enjoyable to watchbr br paperhouse isnt exactly a horror movie its sort of a fantasysuspensesomething else type of movie with some definite horroresque moments but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or somethingbr br give it a chance you wont regret it and maybe you should read the book too
