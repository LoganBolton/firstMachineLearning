a great film this and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel fourbr br the plot is a simple one but works very effectively the blurring between childlike fantasy and hardhitting nightmare is very well blurred the budget looks pretty low but to the credit of those involved it doesnt show too often it also hasnt dated that much eitherbr br i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago and it has withstood halfadozen viewings its one of those films that wont appeal to all though as usual those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of thisbr br charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene cross is also very good carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picturebr br there are some genuinely and i dont say that lightly disturbing moments in this film both halfsecond shockers and more drawnout tensions watch it with the lights outbr br highly recommendedbr br 910br br
