such a film of beauty that its hard to describe maybe its the absence of superfluous dialogue or maybe its the absolutely stellar soundtrack or maybe its just meena mumaris feet but its a joy to watch this movie again and again ive never seen another indian movie that comes close to it and few from any country rival its perfection
