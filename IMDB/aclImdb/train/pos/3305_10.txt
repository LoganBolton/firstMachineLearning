without question this film has to be one of the greatest  in cinematic history i have it watched too many times to remember and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first timebr br where does one beginbr br meena kumaris central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career followed closely by sahib bibi aur ghulam and phool aur pathar each movement and nuance of her performance makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance her masterly interpretation of kathak coupled with her grace tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of urdhu is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screenbr br pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition the photography sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is left breathlessbr br naushads music is unsurpassed his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkablebr br my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should watch this epic mediation on life and art
