the power of kangwon province is director hong sangsoos second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film including the multiple connected narratives in this case two and stories of troubled or troubling relationships as well as a potent dosage of ironybr br one thing thats clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism however this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends only to find herself drawn to a stranger the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woesbr br again hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i dont think hes entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony i think the think ive come to love about hongs films is that they just feel so real especially the complex and conflicted characters not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings but rather that these characters he and the actors present feel fully developed and believablebr br this is not a fast moving film theres a lot of lingering and like the previous film things dont always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways there doesnt appear to be any element of the film that isnt intentionally placed in the film and its made my a little hyperaware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progressesbr br power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion regret longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decisionmaking its a rather hard balance to keep and its surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear this film doesnt pack the same emotional wallop that the first does but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision great viewing for art cinema lovers 810
