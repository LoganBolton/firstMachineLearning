this is a great film if this is any indication than hong sangsoo really is asian cinemas best kept secret its very similar in style to tsai mingliang and hou hsiaohsien and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically but i think i actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films the overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work although it still completely fits that style the camera never moves even once and somehow i found the film less selfconsciously slow than tsai mingliang or hou hsiaohsien which i think is part of the reason i enjoyed it more plus it doesnt keep its subjects quite as detached as hou does i felt like the film was also somehow more complete and less openended just barely than some of their work although thats not to say it had much of anything resembling a forwardmoving plot i would have a hard time believing that sophia coppola wasnt directly influenced by this film for lost in translation scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties cant help but seem familiar
