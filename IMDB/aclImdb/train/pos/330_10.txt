im italian and when ive recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema pasolini etc by that time gone br br the hollywood epic films are goodfor fun perhaps this odyssey had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for popcorn and coke audience however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflectionsbr br in italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors you can find it in some file sharing but its italian only and without subtitles too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
