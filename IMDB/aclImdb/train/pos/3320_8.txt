i liked this moviecute and funnyi found this film to be a good family filmthe dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty wordsorry to say that to the yankees fansi recommend this picture for the entire familyof course with your typical lovecomedy movietheres a long moment in the moviewith im in love and what do i dobut the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick momentsthe movie shows some moments of how the red sox nation in fenway parkhow the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand
