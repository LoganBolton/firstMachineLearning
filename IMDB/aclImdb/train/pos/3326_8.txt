fever pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with hollywood romantic comedies a relationship between two people with little in common the secret hes been hiding that she discovers the inevitable breakup and the very public  well i wont go any further but you get the picture in spite of its predictability it works especially if you love baseball as i do though im not quite as obsessive as ben wrightman a boston schoolteacher played by saturday night live comedian jimmy fallonbr br adapted from a novel by nick hornby by veteran screenplay writers lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ben is a lifelong boston red sox fan whose uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and hes been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women ben is not just a fan but a fanatic who travels to fort meyers florida each winter for the red sox spring training games and never misses a home game during the regular season his family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a red sox museum to visitbr br when he falls for business consultant lindsay meeks drew barrymore he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but ben is not quite ready to do that he would rather attend the yankee series than go with her to baltimore to meet her parents or to go to paris with her and miss the anaheim series it takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving for him to stop and think about his priorities especially when a pintsize dr phil wannabe asks him you love the red sox but have they ever loved you back while the premise of fever pitch is that some things are more important than baseball perish the thought you would never know it from the way things turn out of course to any one familiar with the history of the boston red sox it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans  but this is 2004 the year the curse of the bambino came to an end and as the red sox move to a new level ben might just do the same both lead performances are excellent and the farrelly brothers even manage a pretty gross gag while fever pitch will never be mistaken for an art film it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures go blue jays
