the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon who ive had a crush on since 9th grade which was his first year on snl i am a diehard yankees fan and i didnt find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they begin showing clips of the alcs games i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldnt have to hear that which must not be heard but otherwise it was completely bearablebr br i thought jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy i know that it may not be a academy awardwinning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to seebr br jimmy and drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie what i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because taxi could have killed it i think fever pitch will help him out a lot everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies i imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time tom hanks russell crowe etc youll see that they started off in some flops busom buddies australian soap operas heres wishing jimmy a successful career on screen i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do
