admittedly i know nothing about baseball im not even a fan of the sport but that didnt stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers latest film fever pitch a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy the film is not really about baseball rather its really about relationships and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take placebr br jimmy fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as ben a dorky lightly nerdy schoolteacher ben is a kind of manboy who unfortunately has never really grown up and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the red sox baseball team ben has devoted his life to the sox and does everything from making the pilgrimage to florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernaliabr br one day while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office ben meets the gogetting lindsey a wonderful drew barrymore lindsey is a corporate career orientated kind of girl but she has a kind of cuteness that ben finds totally endearing hes initially hesitant to ask her out thinking that shes way out of his class and lindsey doesnt immediately see a potential partner in benbr br their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are in fact watching a farrelly brothers movie rather than accept lindseys  rather urgent  request to reschedule ben sticks around to play nurse orderly and janitor so ben scrubs the toilet and the dogs teeth while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bedbr br when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch she begins the long fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards soon they are falling in love with lindsey blithely accepting bens fanatical devotion to his sportbr br having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle ben has organized his life around the season  hes never missed a game but their relationship which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter hits a snag at the start of the seasonbr br lindsey wants ben to do other things like holiday with her parents and party with her friends but ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet lindsey halfway can lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work can she really accommodate bens infatuation with sports can a diehard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all of course lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinionwielding friends lindseys strictest buddy the skinny rich and blond robin kadee strickland insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if hes still single at 30 however plump curlyhaired sarah marissa jaret winokur and molly ione skye supply a more optimistic and positive view of benbr br bens eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan while lindsays frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman fallon is terrific as ben exhibiting real big screen potential overcoming the notinsignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic barrymore meanwhile is equally charming as the workaholic lindsey particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needsbr br fever pitch really works and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territorybr br much of the movie was filmed at bostons fenway park which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings as well as the ambiance of the games though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados even so fever pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect mike leonard september 05
