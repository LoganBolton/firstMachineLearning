yes commitment lets say fever pitch might trick you into believing its a baseball moviebr br but no you dont have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the farrelly brothers but of course if you are one you will enjoy it even more with all the references pretty accurate ones id say to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history from the curse of the bambino and everything attributed to it including those two words you cannot pronounce in front of a boston fan bill bucknerbr br drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher thing is fallons character wins barrymores heart by being funny caring sweet and downright perfect but her friends ask her a logical question if hes such a keeper why is he still on the market enter the boston red sox hes been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him he has never missed a red sox home game at fenway park in a long whilebr br and that delicate balance how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guys obsession and how much is that baseballcrazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life is what this movie is all aboutbr br at first you might think that the sportsobsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief well im sad to admit they are not myself as a diehard houston astros fan can say they are all true i would try at every way available to see every stros game listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet i read the chronicles sports section every day and yes my room looks like the shed minute maid parks gift shop with a closet full of astros gear including 5 jerseys 20 tshirts and you know the rest fallons character even has the red sox mbna mastercardbr br fallon was credible enough as the fanatical red sox faithful even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon thank god adam sandler wasnt in it and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each others passionsbr br id say itll be a classical romantic comedy not enough to be among the best movies in history but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike
