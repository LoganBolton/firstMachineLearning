i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isnt in she falls in love but when spring comes along she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ben has put her onbr br its a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has he cant part from what he loves the most thats what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he isbr br its a funny movie and you wont strike out if you rent this one
