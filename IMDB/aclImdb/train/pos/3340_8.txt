fever pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenesbr br i have lived through a milder version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the mets first world series win and then i watched the mets clinch their next one because i was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood national league teams other heartbreaking failures to win it again and it was me who took our older son to his only fenway park game as i caught a bit of red sox fever as a graduate student in bostonbr br so compared to reality the script believably creates two people with actual jobs it is particularly impressive that drew barrymores character is a substantive workaholic who has antibarbie skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents dont completely workbr br it is even set up credibly how she meets jimmy fallons math teacher and how she falls for his winter guy  though its surprising that his red sox paraphernalia filled apartment didnt tip her off to his jekyllandhyde summer guy their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grownup way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single fallon surprisingly rises to his characters gradual emotional maturitybr br while the ending borrows heavily from o henry the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the soxs incredible 2004 season into a revised story line with lots of cooperation from the red sox organization for filming at the stadiumbr br the script goes out of its way to explain why fallon doesnt have a boston accent as an immigrant from new jersey but that doesnt explain why his motley friends dont the most authentic sounding boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket holders who kindly kibitz the basics of sox lore to neophyte barrymore and any such audience membersbr br the song selection includes many red sox fans favorites from the opening notes of the classic dirty water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear
