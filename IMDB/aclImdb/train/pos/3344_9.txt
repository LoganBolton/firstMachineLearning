i went to see fever pitch with my mom and i can say that we both loved it it wasnt the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other and blah blah blah you werent waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together it was more real because you saw them through the relationship rather than the whole movie be about them getting together people could actually relate to the film because it didnt seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations it was really funny and i think it was jimmy fallons best performance all in all i would definitely recommend it
