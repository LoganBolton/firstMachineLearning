what i expected a rather lame overlystereotypical portrayal of a sportsmad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports teambr br what i got an evenhanded story where both guy and gal end up admitting  to themselves and each other  that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they sharebr br sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works barrymore is classic barrymore that perfect blend of sweet strong and adorable we expect that from her and she deliveredbr br but fallon is the nice surprise in this film he brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life like caring about kids and his girlfriend fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection he can be caring you just ran across the field for me and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the red sox how did the grass feel kinda spongy at the same time fallons portrayal made the movie hopefully this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon something beyond the overthetop sophomoric humor typical of snl alums ie will ferrellbr br in short a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spoton humorous lines most delivered with brilliant subtlety by fallonbr br hey i saw this with my wife  not a baseball fan  and she loved it as much as i did its neither a guy flick nor a chick flick its a terrific makeyoulaugh flick go see it
