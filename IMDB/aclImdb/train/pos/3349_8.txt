man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both jett rink in giant which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked and charles laughtons intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both mitch and jan sterling in unflattering tones its a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his town tamer sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to  possibly  be almost as bad as the men he dispatches certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family  burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him  doesnt inspire much confidence in his stability as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry hull it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in spartacus
