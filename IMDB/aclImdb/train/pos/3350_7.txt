i dont remember ever seeing this one before tonight probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by but it is a well crafted b western with an interestingly brooding storyline complimented by acting veering from the good to cornybr br robert mitchum slopes into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter and stays for a time as towntamer as usual the good business folk have mixed emotions  they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring it still applies relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the industries but pretend to deplore the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people whats fascinating about this film is mitchums cynically intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies and the townsfolks acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones favourite bit the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the red dog saloon the firing of the main saloon bordered on nasty but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poisonbr br overall a very good film with its only fault tending to be a little hokeyness  not so good for dogooders who would probably prefer a lifetime of negotiation with evil rather than end it
