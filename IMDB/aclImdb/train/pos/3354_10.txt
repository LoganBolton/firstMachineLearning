this movie is finally out on dvd in italy completely restored i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days 2003 when italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship or the us for that matter i am glad there are outcasts as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune maybe they can teach the sophia lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beingsbr br back to the movie as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you dont understand the italian language but i can assure you that the showoff of machism the distortion of reality in that everpresent radiochronicle of the hitler visit to rome can really make you shiverbr br a masterpiecebr br
