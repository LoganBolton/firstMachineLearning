i too was quite astonished to see how few people had voted on this film and just had to write something about it although my comments are quite similar to those written alreadybr br i like many things about the film the superb acting between mastroianni  loren the way the film is narrated humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders and contrasted to the simultaneously  continuously ongoing inhumane marching pace of the fascist radio announcer who happens to be a colleague of mastroiannis partand the adherents going to and coming from the show to me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human maybe some of you would argue that the antifascist message is too clearly delivered but to me this didnt destroy the film in any way my vote is 1010
