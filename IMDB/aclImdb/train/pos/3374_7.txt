soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70s and still very persuasive even by todays standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thoughtprovoking this films qualitylevel surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive with overpopulation unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylents most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little oversentimental at times and the climax doesnt really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riotsequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70s cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and theres a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is sciencefiction in my book a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity no fancy spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet
