is this the future that awaits us an overpopulated unforgiving wasteland with a hellish unwanted existence this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 lets hope that the world isnt going to end up like thisbr br soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much it had likable characters a semiapocalyptic setting a compelling and thoughtprovoking storyline and the machoest macho man out there charleton heston richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant dirty feel youre almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitantsbr br the characters are wonderful charleton heston who has become one of my favorite actors is thorn the man created this role of badass yet likable toughguy i could definitely put myself in thorns shoes he sees that something isnt right but everyone around him either doesnt listen more like paid not to listen or wants him dead edward g robinson in his last film rip plays the lovable old sol who has had enough of this nasty place everyone else is great especially leigh tayloryoung as shirl a piece of furniture that comes with the apartment in which she residesbr br the special effects are fantastic even for 1973 the soylent green factory the futuristic apartments and especially the scoops bulldozers that get rid of people were excellent the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettlingbr br one final note is the ending which even now still shocked me it is gruesome but if you think about it its a pretty good ideabr br the bottom line br br an excellent 70s science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy
