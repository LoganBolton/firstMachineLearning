this was a very thought provoking film especially for 1973 at the time it was actually a huge box office success after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten but its central messages were too important to disappear completelyit was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its timeno one had ever heard of the greenhouse effectbefore 1985 and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought upbr br the sets and special effects might look a little outdated but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense this is a message movie not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosionsbr br this was also hestons last good film the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made and the ending might be creepy and depressing but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this
