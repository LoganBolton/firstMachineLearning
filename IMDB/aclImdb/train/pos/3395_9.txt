this is a brilliant scifi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliantwhile most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plotsbut whatever the cause i have always found this difference fascinatingbr br the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been assassinated as the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future american society the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buyincluding furniturea euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment at the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed br br why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discussit could ruin the film for you however the film has a great plot and acting and is superexciting to watch plus it features edward g robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to heston though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great scifi film that is allegorical and profound
