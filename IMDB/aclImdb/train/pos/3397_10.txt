soylent green isa really good movie actuallybr br i never wouldve thought it i dont really like heston in his scifi efforts hes one of those actors who like superman manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time i prefer more vulnerable heroes and indeed he sneers his way through much of soylent green too but as hes supposed to be playing an overconfident bully i dont really mindbr br i can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie soylent green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals what do you know  it looks just like 1973 and its lacking in action but i admired the films vision of a complex corrupt and highly stratified society and i was so pleased to see that edward g robinson had such a moving funny final role nice little character moments  like when he shares some precious food with heston  really make the moviebr br the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these days when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to funny isnt it to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie
