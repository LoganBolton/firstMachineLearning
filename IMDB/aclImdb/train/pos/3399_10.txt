this was eddie robinsons 101st film and his last and he died of cancer nine days after shooting was complete all of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignantbr br although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated also note the video game shown in the film but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless heston said he had wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulationbr br several things make this film a classic the story is solidbr br the acting is topnotch especially the interplay between heston and robinson with nice performances also by cotten and petersbr br the music is absolutely perfect the medley of beethoven grieg and tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements make for some truly moving scenes this was the icing on the cake for the filmbr br and the theme or the point of the film is a significant one yes its a film about overpopulation but on a more important note its a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with mans stewardship of earth its in the subtext that you find the real message of the film pay attention to what sol says about the old days of the past which is our present and note how thorn is incapable of comprehending what sol is sayingbr br this film is one of my top scifi films of all time
