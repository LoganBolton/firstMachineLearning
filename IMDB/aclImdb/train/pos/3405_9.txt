the garden of allah was one of the first feature length 3strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disneys 5year exclusivity deal was 1935s becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for its garish color costumesbr br the garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat
