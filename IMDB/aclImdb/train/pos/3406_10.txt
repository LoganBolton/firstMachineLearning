in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding i had no idea that technicolor came out so early although i didnt like the ending the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa the cast is excellent and marlene dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and i just loved her in this flick basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie i couldnt get over the scenery and the sets the hotel the palm trees the desert its all there the legionnaires also bring a beau geste feeling to the film they certainly dont make movies like these anymore dont fail to watch this classic
