i give this movie an a for the sheer camp of it as dietrichs daughter maria riva wrote in the book on her mother if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp it can be very amusing and how i laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly ridiculously fantastically melodramatic dialogue viewers whove read the accounts of boyers toupee it kept coming unstuck in the heat will snicker every time it makes an appearancebr br dietrich and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines  instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light if youre starring in a turkey might as well look good dietrichs costumes are out of this world as riva notes in her book dietrich managed to steal paramounts travis banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns such as the chiffon beige dress  capebr br i heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the technicolor it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936  the color is fantasticbr br in short if you watch the garden of allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness you cant help but enjoy it
