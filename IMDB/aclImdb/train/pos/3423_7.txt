do not expect a depiction of the truth however the accounts of these veterans of the iraqi  afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration br br the major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their postwar struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives br br my major criticism of the film is twofold it is onesided and it advocates antiwar activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the militarys and veterans affairs programs for helping those whove suffered and still suffer the traumas of war these are not fatal flaws of the filmbr br as a veteran myself i know that the horrible aftermath of war is real and these young men and women articulate it very well these vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing
