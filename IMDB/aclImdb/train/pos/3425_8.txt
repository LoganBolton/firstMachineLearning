there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a killbot factory here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke but what patricia foulkrods documentary does is show us scarily that it is not that far from the truth after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of me or them since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who dont think of combatants as people to develop in them a most unnatural state the sustainable urge to killbr br first off this isnt an antiwar movie as such whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesnt get as much media attention as say the debate over the legality of a war or its physical successes or failures the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being its the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current middle east conflict foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts especially vietnam painfully clear this isnt about any particular war its about the problems caused by war in generalbr br structurally the film seems to be split into three sections how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive how they are treated once they are in combat and what happens once they leave the army once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple how word like democracy and freedom are banded around but once the training begins they become enemy and kill and destroy how once in action soldiers dont care what they are ordered to do as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order whatever it may be they are one step closer to going home they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as thats what theyve been trained to dobr br but the ground truths main goal is to highlight the way the us army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home there is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up this is the final indignity that once they are used they are cast awaybr br if there is a flaw in the film it is that foulkrod doesnt attempt to show another side to the argument you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome it would have been interesting to see those of aÂ… less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself knownbr br but other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary and foulkrods use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war
