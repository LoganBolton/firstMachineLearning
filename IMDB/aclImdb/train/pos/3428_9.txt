i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine i didnt know what to expect id not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what all in all it is very well done it doesnt focus on the generalization of antiwar statements which to me left the politics out of it the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals make no mistake  this is not an antiwar film anyone who says it is hasnt seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls
