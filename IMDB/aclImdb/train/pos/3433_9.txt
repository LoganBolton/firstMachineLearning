i first saw this at a foreign film festival its a beautifully paced nailbiter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold its all shot in a gritty grainy style that hollywood rarely uses  but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully note tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was therebr br theres a lot of humor and some romance too i dont want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises so ill just say this heist film starts from a great script and the directing and performances are top notch darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerveracking example of its genre  id put it up against rafifi topkapi and its miles ahead of the new oceans 11 though deliberately not as glossy rent or buy it now
