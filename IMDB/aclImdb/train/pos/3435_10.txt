this film is a wonderfully simplistic work enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time the performances from miranda otto oh how she deserves so much more recognitionand george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bitparts in them selves as is alices longsuffering boyfriend who i couldnt help but feel slightly sorry for theres one particular scene i could watch over and over and i have its such a shame that films like these dont get recognition and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy i cried i laughed and i sighed id recommend this film to anyone
