descent yeah boy i havent seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumonts twentynine palms 2003 by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of female empowerment the descent 2005 directed by our splat pack friend neil marshall who also happens to be a major talent his own right but getting back to this descent the nc17 rated uhoh effort on which the lovely ms dawson takes a producers credit congratulations and directed by talia lugacy strong chance thats not a real name as good as it is in moments it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed as a producer you really have to tighten up that script of course in the premise alone you have the promise of rising conflict but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflictbr br at times this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and well i guess ill let the others whove already commented here speak to the boringness of it namely that which occurs in the second act but find me a second act that isnt boring theres also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasiindependent films like descent in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her fameidentity to get a script into production that would under usual circumstances not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the films leading role rosario dawson is gorgeous and apparently you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long but oh wowwee how fast the time just slips away rosy aint no undergraduate no more thats part of the confusion about the screenplay is she a graduate student a ta no graduate students dont really have these type of qualms with football players do they again if you are rosario dawson executive producer thats the one of many many aspects to the professional film process youll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career and if you dont have the answer to why youre movie isnt convincing let me tell you there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious wellqualified undergraduate aged talents pining to get involved in the business who might have nailed that lead character down all the while looking just as darn good as you know who but unfortunately without ms dawson no honey no money i have to say the camera department did an outstanding job however because this film is really well shot ie lit in all its drearydreamy darkness the nightclub scenes look wonderful one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time the shootingframing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watchbr br descent is good not great however i have a feeling thanks to netflix this movie will find a life of its own i hope this group continues making films if youre into experimental american filmmaking cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs or male model dropouts in their early twenties or if youre an undergraduate just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university rosario dawsons descent might be your flavor of rockaroll
