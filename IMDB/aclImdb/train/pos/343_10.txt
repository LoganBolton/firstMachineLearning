katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out forbr br ok where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful girls being targeted by a romantic serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggotinfested chocolates and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick  axe knife electric powerdrill bow and arrow hot iron etc ok so basically its a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexualitybr br horror movies arent supposed to be shakespeare but im not gonna go there i love horror movies but not all of them this one i adore its up there with some of my other favorites its funny sexy and scary the killers mask is childishly creepy and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon jessica capshaw is a very capable actress and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy buress was a hoot bleedmedrycom and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like herbr br highlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done and the audiovisual maze was sinister the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunesbr br lowpoint i felt as though the killer wasnt featured enough we barely saw the mask and it wasnt featured at all during the climax i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonethelessbr br the twist at the end wasnt that big of a surprise but im really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole explaining killer routinebr br i dont like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be itbr br my rating 1010 bullseye
