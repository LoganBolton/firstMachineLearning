love rosario dawson think shes one of the finest actresses of the modern erabr br descent seems to be more about selfempowerment than anything else its the consistent undertone in everything in the film the dialog is flat the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided the only consistency is the representation of selfempowerment in the characters and rosarios journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back againbr br pitching this as a rape classic isnt appropriate and thats probably why so many people dont enjoy the film the standard rape audience wouldnt particularly like this film and maybe thats the point the film asks more questions than it answers and it does confront its target audience whether they like it or not theres a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesnt slap the audience across the face with selfrighteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be all the wrong reasonsbr br descent is a good film which imho is severely underrated
