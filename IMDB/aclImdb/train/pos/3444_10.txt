i rented this movie simply because rosario dawson was in it i sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes but because it was a real film no hollywood bs no explosions no corny one liners film it drew you in slowly reeling you toward a tragically human fate some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken they like movies mindless entertainment for entertainments sake alone michael bays transformers and the like were produced for just this audience no need to think people just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain well even place advertisements throughout the movie to keep you buying our products and dont forget the explosions we all love explosions here we make the distinction art can be entertaining but its also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily movie are entertainment descent is a film film is artbr br if you still house a soul within your walking meatsack apparatus this rape scene is every bit as powerful as irreversable the distinction here is that irreversable was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued descent is about date rape no less disgusting no less depraved just different this is about trust violation soul desecration and the scars that run deep had the character maya been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene but seeing as she was desperate to escape the scene is sickening jared is a sick and manipulative serial rapist and its wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair how could maya ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her jareds slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping she is ruinedbr br the film as a whole is beautiful the camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on maya and the silent inner workings of her mind all this accomplished by rosario with facial expression and gesture the soundtrack was excellent a blend of everything my particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together maya dancing in a sea of writhing bodies something inside her awakening becoming aware all set to a beautifully sad jeff buckley tunebr br i dont think ive really spoiled anything here but im stopping before i do bottom line i think this was the best film of 2007 hands down unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you dont hack and slash gang rape or nuke anything then people just cant be bothered death isnt the worst thing that can happen to you its only the last thing that will happen in this existence the worst things that happen never leave you they are always in your thoughts when you shower when you brush your teeth when you buy a christmas present when you tie your shoe they haunt you they haunt you until that last thing releases youbr br treat yourself challenge yourself watch this film
