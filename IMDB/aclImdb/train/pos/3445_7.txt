first this was a brave film ive seen irreversible and can understand the comparisons however i cannot begin to understand the people whove trashed this film i can see how the end may have come off extreme but id be lying if i didnt say i wished that every guy whos ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what jared got conversely it didnt solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesnt pretend to is what made me appreciate itbr br the comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with i certainly did and intently im 24 years old the way the film drags made it realistic to me people have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film not only do they lose interest they demolish whatever has been built and call it rubbish when in actuality its their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as talia lugacysbr br rosario dawson displayed the numbness of selfdestruction flawlessly i think she portrayed maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act i rarely ever see done well often times much like the films aimed at teens mentioned in the prior comment the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed isolated and lifeless dawson in my opinion manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to dronelike existence in the waking hours working some dead end job to survive and distract and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety bringsbr br i thought this film told the truth and i appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape so many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginningi believe that mayas face during the act was the endnot the act itselfnot the vengeance or the meaning behind itjust her facebr br thank you
