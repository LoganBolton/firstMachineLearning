yesterday i attended the world premiere of descent at the tribeca film festival in nyc i had a great time it was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow myspacer marcus patrickbr br i give the movie 75 starts out of a possible 10 starsbr br the movie begins with maya rosario dawson at college you can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on the photography in this film was excellent she meets jared chad faust and they become sweethearts it appears like any other relationship in the beginning the man is in quest of the womans attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get both played this well very innocent flirtation between the two he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apartbr br the apartment is very dreary and dark they eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles this actually reminded me of a dungeon here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her this is a very dark and gritty rape scene this scene is not for the young or weak at heart the rape scene is a little long and hard to take but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that followsbr br maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex she falls into her own abyss she starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there she is told to go see adrian marcus patrick the first thing i remember about this character is that they say he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving he is actually the one who introduces maya to drugs they begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie the club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise i thought they were well done and i noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audiencebr br maya is then back in college as a ta and who is in her class  jared her rapist you could see the confusion and emotion on mayas face what should i do what do i do next the shots of her face and the emotions are pricelessbr br what unfolds next is not actually whats happening she acts interested in jared she appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again i was sitting there saying could this really be happening it wasnt nothing could be farther from the truthbr br she invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up now her apartment is dark and gritty she has him strip down completely he thinks hes going to get lucky she then teases him like any woman can shes caressing him everywhere and hes getting excited note for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity  may not be right for the younger viewerbr br she then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him once again the scene is dark gritty and very roughbr br if you are going to see the movie and dont want to know what happens next skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraphbr br this is where adrian reenters the picture maya has adrian save her by performing extremely rough male sex with jared she thinks this is the final revenge adrian continues to take all of jareds manhood and strips his dignity to nothing marcus as adrian plays this scene as believable as anyone can he is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen after the movie during a qa session marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and chad maya believes that this revenge will save her but i dont think it does one of the final scenes has a closeup of mayss face and you see a tear roll down her cheek this was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie did she get the revenge she wanted was it as satisfying as she expected in my opinion it does not it only makes matters worsebr br this is an excellent movie will well acted roles and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it i would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age rosario chad and marcus should be commended for jobs well done the directing and photography must also be commended it was a night that i enjoyed
