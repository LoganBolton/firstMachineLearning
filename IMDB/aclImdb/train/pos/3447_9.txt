there is no director i like more than mamoru oshii but sadly even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks tachiguishi is one of them and even though i loved it to bits its not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release itbr br in between his big and serious films oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects while tachiguishi definitely falls into this category oshii has really outdone himself with this one creating something that is very hard to classify even as a freaky japanese flick go figurebr br at its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike otaku no video but rather than make a fool of an existing subculture oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes scrounging away food for free and upholding the japanese culinary level oshiis approach on the subject has close ties with dainipponjin as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be deadpan humor taken to the extremebr br but that is not all rather than simply shooting his mockumentary oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation a weird mix of live action photography digital animation and puppets on a stick performed and acted out or posed if you want by the greats of the japanese animation industry no less as the project was supposed to be as lowbudget as possiblebr br and if you think that just about covers it know that the film is extremely dialogueheavy making it a good companion piece for innocence the influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural political and even philosophical angles fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues and to make it even worse the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material needless to say multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the filmbr br that said on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of postwar japan the film plays like youd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold but somehow the big and crudely animated cutout photography limbs of which figures are assembled dont quite make it all that serious the range of characters introduced is sublime shinji higuchi taking the cake as cowcreature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fastfood chains with his gang of bullpeoplebr br oshii regular kenji kawai provides besides a pretty comical performance a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky strange and comical a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the filmbr br visually the film is very atmospheric though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective remains toned down only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time which is not exactly a bad thing seeing how tachiguishi is so dialogueheavy despite that the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the filmbr br beware though because tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer if you dont speak japanese there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention on top of that the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about im sure i missed many of the finer points of the filmbr br tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesnt let off from there on i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch subs a dub would actually be best for a film like this much like container though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask forbr br with all of that said i can only congratulate oshii on another marvelous film its rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works the film is smart looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity it is immensely funny even if you cant catch all the details on the first viewing but be sure to at least get this with decent subs as the automated english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at allbr br tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and im not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe and the rest of the western world is still waiting for a sign of this film but for those that like oshii appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits it is a film that cannot be missed even though it could just as well misfire 4550
