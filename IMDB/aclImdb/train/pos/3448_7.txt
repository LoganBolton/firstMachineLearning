a documentary without a loss for words everbr br let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof let us assume it is a commentary on japanese society and as this film is as fast paced an absurdist documentary as they come the constant wordplay as fast is it goes and as poorly translated as it is in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the copenhagen cinematek it is still quite enjoyable br br but for the patient and only the truly patient and openminded im talking to you jim jarmusch fans with add relapses i believe this is a film for you its an intelligent film if you allow it to win you overbr br quite beautiful and quite kitsch and quite japanese subculture and quite experimental static 2d in a 3d world all in all fun for those that want to see a japanese film that spoofs japanese food culture a thumbs up if youre in the mood for something completely different
