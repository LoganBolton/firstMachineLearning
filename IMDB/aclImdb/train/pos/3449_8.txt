tachigui the amazing lives of the fastfood grifters japanese title tachiguishi retsudenbr br director mamoru oshii featuring toshio suzuki mako hyodo kenji kawai shinji higuchi katsuya terada narrated by koichi yamadera br br way back in 1995 mamoru oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature ghost in the shell which helped consolidate animes international acceptance  and also burrowed itself into andy and larry wachowskis overall concept for the matrixbr br the movies sequel innocence 2004 was the inaugural japanese animated film to compete for the palme dor at cannes and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its oft unfathomable plotbr br always the trendsetter oshii has now presented us with tachigui the amazing lives of the fastfood grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with ghost in the shell nor japanese anime for that matterbr br say hello to oshiis creation superlivemation not quite animation nor exactly liveaction instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of 30000 snapshots which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cutout fashion reminiscent of balinese puppetry the movement itself is a stilted stopmotion style that echoes sequences from shinya tsukamotos experimental tetsuo iron man 1988br br i couldnt think of any method but this one said oshii in a recent interview with the daily yomiuri i realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animationbr br the cast choice is equally enigmatic kenji kawai  who also composed the superlative soundtrack  appears as a ravenous burger fanatic while renowned studio ghibli producer toshio suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion others include katsuya terada who dabbled with oshii on blood the last vampire and shinji higuchi  a special effects whiz whos worked on godzilla moviesbr br koichi yamaderas narration sounds like the stuff of a dry nhk documentary  which belies the comic undertone here as well as yamaderas extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like spike siegel in cowboy bebopbr br and the plot itself is a bizarre reimagining of postwwii japan in the context of various fastfood offshoots  from soba ramen shops to gyudon standup bars american dogs in the heatup trays of convenience stores to mcdonalds inspired burgerchain restaurants food is a primal root of desire asserted oshii by way of explanation br br thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer the fastfood grifters of the title people who dont like to pay for their tucker and are constantly finetuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies br br oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the art of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country and which goes some way toward explaining the use of tachigui in the titlebr br the director of liveaction movies avalon stray dog as well as animation oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums the celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formatsbr br at times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating just dont ask what its all really supposed to mean oshiis films which are equal parts cerebral and innovative are often not particularly clear storywise where oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor  here youll find kentucky fried rat death by hulahoop the worlds fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movies very nature of surrealismbr br this is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like godard and truffaut and perhaps owes as much to andrei tarkovsky as he does david lynch so it shouldnt come as any surprise that at one stage a b52 bomber does a fly through in a yoshinoya lookalike franchise the 54yearold writerdirector seemed to think this natural the japan i depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality he suggestedbr br of course br br by andrez bergen
