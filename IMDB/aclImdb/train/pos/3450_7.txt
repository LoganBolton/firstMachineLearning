having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that cant do anything film a bad script and in some cases dont seem to carebr br well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release it is good the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role ok hes not oscar material yet but hell learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this moviebr br ultimately just give it a go you wont be disappointed you wont be bored in fact i think youll be more than happy with the end result
