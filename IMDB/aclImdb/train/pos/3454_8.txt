first off im not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good in fact im not even a huge justin fan but i did like this moviebr br i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that id never even heard of i had to see what it was about i didnt find justins acting that bad it was clearly the worst out of the group but its a pretty impressive group with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didnt even make the first credits list the story is basic a journalist uncovering corrupt cops but i found it well done l l cool js character was clearly conflicted but i honestly didnt know what he would do in the end morgan freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so well and as much as i love kevin spacey he was kind of just there his character didnt have a whole lot of substance but its kevin spacey he can do no wrongbr br surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop truly believable and really in character he freaked me out a couple of timesbr br i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest horrible catchphrases unjustified action sequences stuff like that but it was surprisingly well done and i didnt find any of that every shooting had a point it wasnt clich√©d pretty solid reallybr br overall amazing cast decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump i dont know why it didnt appear in theatres it was better than some garbage ive seen on the big screen i would say its worth seeing
