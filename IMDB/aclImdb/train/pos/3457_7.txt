this is the columbo that got directed by steven spielberg at an early point in his career its nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for spielberg can be seen in this movie the movie is basically in the same style as most of spierlbergs 70s movies and tv works so that means that some characters tend to show some quirkinesss and no im not just talking about the columbo character alone the kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 spielberg movie jaws but other than some small hints of typical early spielberg elements you cant call this movie the work of and fine example of a rising director star not that its bad of course it isnt but as i said earlier it also isnt anything too sensationalbr br this movie began really well and very promising but after its fine opening in which as always the murder occurred the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch dull because its mostly a columbo movie by the book that doesnt have real memorable moments in it not dull because its a boring movie to watchbr br the murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential the story however didnt really explored all of its possibilities at least thats the feeling this movie left me withbr br the movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of jack cassidy who thinks hes smarter then columbo due to his mysterycrime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints leading away from himself but of course columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game alongbr br the movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing funny to see that also most of this was all mostly consistent with spielbergs later work especially some of the cameraanglesbr br a fine and perfectly watchable columbo movie but dont let the name of spielberg attached to it rise your expectations for it too highlybr br 710
