casting jack cassidy as ken frankin was sheer brilliance cassidy personified arrogance confidence charm and wit  all with a condescending evil little smirk on his face in my opinion jack cassidy is by far the best murderer having appeared three times in the columbo series this particular and first performance is my favorite columbo episode ever  hands down a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work yes there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at timescapturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin also the panoramic and tight in shots at big bear lake ca franklins cabin home were very impressivebr br if you have not yet seen this episode then you owe it to yourself to do so  its a true masterpiecebr br jack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer his charismatic personality was highly infectious his death in 1976 at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic  he surely had his best years ahead of him rest in peace jack you will live on for eternity through your great work
