even though im quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can rememberbr br its the sort of film that is worth trying the once i can see why it wasnt released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didnt much details except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris stars id never heard of him he played john or aiden quinn who played paul however they are certainly underestimated actorsbr br the film had a slow start but as it developed i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like the script was brilliant and harris got lennons accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the makeup artists made them look excellentbr br this paragraph may be counted as a spoilerbr br as i mentioned before it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for lennons rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch itbr br it is quite different from the other biographical films ive seen where its about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well eg backbeatbr br in conclusion i would say if youre a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about 95 minutes long its worth waiting for the film to developbr br if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the comments page for this film id be very interested
