recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any cooperation of real life persons that in itself is an eye catcher yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself engrossed throughoutdue in no small way to the crisp thoughtful and interesting dialoguethe film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical legends who formerly composed together then seperatedthe film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial split what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they playfaults and all that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about two of us talking can make an excellent picture worthy of at least an 8 out of 10
