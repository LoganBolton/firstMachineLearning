very slight spoilerbr br  this movie despite being only on tv is absolutely excellent i didnt really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so i cant really comment on that the acting in this was so good i had to pinch myself and say remember its only a movie this didnt really happen as i sat and listened to harris and quinn talk i knew that it was exactly what john and paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting the offhanded comments and burns from john were right on with his characterespecially in the restaurant as was his depression while paul was very easy going and laid back both actors did and excellent job and i was thrilled to have seen this movie its a wicked experience for any beatles fan and prepare for a few surprises
