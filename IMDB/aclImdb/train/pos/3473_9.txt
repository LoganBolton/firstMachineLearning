i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film was vh1 treading on hollow ground here i mean harris and quinn dont really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me its far from the exploitation film i expected instead its a character study a lowkey whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn its hard if not impossible to capture what we once had and what has passed us by
