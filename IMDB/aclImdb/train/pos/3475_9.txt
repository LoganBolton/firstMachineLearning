being the beatlemaniac that i am i approached two of us with a combination of fear and fascination having seen in his life the john lennon story i was quite concerned that two of us will turn out no better the fact that aidan quinn and jared harris look absolutely nothing like john lennon and paul mccartney  even with some makeup and proper hairdos  didnt help one bitbr br but i was more than a bit pleasantly surprised its probably thanks to the involvement of michael lindsayhogg who directed let it be in 1970 and consequently probably knew john and paul quite well that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did the writing credit for two of us is given to a man named mark stanfield of whom i know absolutely nothing i feel confident that director lindsayhogg had more than a bit to do with the script two of us is not a biography of the beatles it has very little plot in fact and takes place all in one day in new york city what it does is imagine a meeting between john and paul in 1976 while john lived in new york that meeting is entirely fictitious of course  though it cant truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place but through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence their sense of humor their different reaction to stardom and most of all their relationship what made them such a great team and what broke them upbr br since its a talk movie nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half its likely to bore all but true fans of the beatles but its a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling and is both informative and touching for those interested in these two musical giants very quickly youll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like john and paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script and so committed are the actors two of us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses and a tale that is both sad and funny most certainly recommended
