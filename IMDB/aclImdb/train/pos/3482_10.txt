this is my first comment on imdb website and the reason im writing it is that were talking about one of the best films ever ne goryuy will make you laugh and cry at the same time you will fall in love if youre not a fan yet with georgian choir singing tradition and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it what i like a lot about this film is that actors in the nonleading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character the film is starring vahtang kikabidze who is great but you will remember every single face around him in the film you will find yourself quoting their lines that have become household names for so many russianspeaking people a film to live with simple yet deep you will want to watch it again and again
