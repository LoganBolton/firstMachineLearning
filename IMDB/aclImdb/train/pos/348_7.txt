these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good funbr br the valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought outbr br the film has one peach of a line hes no angel when he in fact is angel watching buffy reruns will never be the samebr br the cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters sorry but nobr br the direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothesbr br essentially the main directorial plus lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks psychos shower scene is tributed along with halloweens masking br br murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i knowbr br light viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking
