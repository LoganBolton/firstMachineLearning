this film is underrated i loved it it was truly sweet and heartfelt a family who struggles but isnt made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today the film didnt make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood havebr br instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up he does slowly by the films end he has a ways to go but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time a truly heartfelt indie
