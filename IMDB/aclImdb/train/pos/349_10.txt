call me stupid but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie valentine it was so wellmade wellwritten wellacted welldirected etc everything about it was wonderful there were parts that were relatively routine lilys death very funny wwwbleedmedrycom completely horrifying and creepy paiges death and just plain heartbreaking the first scene i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david boreanaz denise richards both of whom i met and got autographs from during the filming of this movie  very nice people and marley sheltonbr br i am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone this movie is in no way a scream clone in fact this film runs rings around scream it actually makes sense scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it excuse me but it looks like scream was also a clone too ahem friday the 13th halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers i also think that the novelty of the cupidmasked killer is brilliant its so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things another novelty the nose bleeding makes way for a fantastic ending the ending gives me chills every time i see it so even if you didnt like it the first time watch valentine again and give it another chancebr br ps keep an eye out for my new website wwwlovehurtsorg coming soon
