this movie works because it feels so genuine the story is simple and realistic perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that mostall of us experienced during our teen yearsbr br the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers the dialogue is fresh and honest and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references also the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very tangible waybr br on an artistic level i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neorealism films like the bicycle thief and la strada movies rarely feel as real as this does  or as bicycle thief did and the only other movie ive seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is elia kazans splendor in the grass writerdirector peter sollett deserves tremendous praise this film is quite an achievementbr br on a personal level i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect as an italianamerican i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema as racist womanizing criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations hispanics and asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies good thing gong li didnt try to become famous in americabr br of course thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures and the influence of miramax we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there  but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best while i do really like my big fat greek wedding it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight with less exaggerated and broadlydrawn characters while still being very funny in its own right finally latino characters worthy of note i have a feeling that this is a film that will be rememberedbr br of course now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the dominican republic i hope peter sollett gets around to making a movie about italians soon   marc dipaolo
