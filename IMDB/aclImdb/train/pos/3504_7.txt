this movie feels like a film project as though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though despite this amateurish feel the movie is effective its like a crosssection of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings being raised by a grandparent of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality this provides for some predictable but well done conflict probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings a good watch but nothing stirring
