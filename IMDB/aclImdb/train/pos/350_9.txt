i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever when i watched valentine i was amazed at how great the story line actually was it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was nonstop entertaining and suspenseful it had a mindtwisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesnt deserve all the crap it gets i recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on valentines day because its sure to give you a ton of chills oh and dont even pay attention to the trailer or rating please dont
