true fans of film will love this authentic moviebr br i disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a onestar and calling it unrealistic while i dont have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists ive spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave i dont know what the basis is for others comments that the film is unrealistic the dialog is greatbr br the low budget production value didnt bother me a bit i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodramabr br i completely bought into the characters motivations and reactions the acting was believable and impressive for new and nonactorsbr br if your idea of good film is transformers or fast  furious then skip it if you enjoy good character driven dramas then see itbr br regarding the negative commenters being trolls click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews
