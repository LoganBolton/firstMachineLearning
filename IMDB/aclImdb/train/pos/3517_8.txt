this is a film which had eluded me thus far but now that ive watched it emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style as usual with the divx format the viewing was far from ideal  marred by the occasional video and mostly audio glitches  but given that the film is still unavailable on r1 dvd this will have to do for the moment since the films reputation is quite high within the genre itself i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a wellknown actor in the leadbr br anyway the belated entrance of the films nominal star  franchot tone  packs quite a wallop especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first tone was a underrated actor  he was rarely given meaty roles and this may well be his best making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous the female lead  ella raines who would later feature in brute force 1947 as well as siodmaks own the suspect 1944 and the strange affair of uncle harry 1945  is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss alan baxter innocent of his wifes brutal murder other key supporting parts are essayed by thomas gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator and elisha cook jr  the genres quintessential fall guy  as an illfated ladies man of a percussionistbr br like brute forces jules dassin siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction  all tilted angles and terrific setpieces including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishlyattired raines who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail another great lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender another uncooperative witness around the streets of new york  which results in his being mowed down by a car br br notable too is the trial sequence  which is entirely depicted through the audiences reaction so that judge jury witnesses and da are never actually seen although the judges voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor samuel s hinds the centerpiece of the film is the scene in which gomez and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved with the inspectors put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone dizzy spells the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment where she discovers evidence of his guilt  and he confesses to having had an affair with baxters wife but killed her when she wouldnt desert her husband for himbr br by the way i hit upon a little goof in the film while the story is clearly set in 1943 i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film  in which alan curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater  the establishing shot of new york comprising clearly of stock footage features a marquee promoting laurel and hardys 1938 musical comedy swiss miss incidentally famed mystery writer cornell woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym
