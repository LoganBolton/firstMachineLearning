its a colorful slasher movie thats about itbr br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things figuring out whos the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anywaybr br the death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of 80s horror movies like friday the 13th br br another nice thing about this movie is that its hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious br br people who dont like slasher movies wont like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same br br mb
