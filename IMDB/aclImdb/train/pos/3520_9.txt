this is a b series film noir and my vote reflects its membership in that genre i saw this film last night at a leftbank cinema in paris where it opened a twoweek film noir run the film has some flaws yes but far too many delicious elements to ignorebr br as the previous reviewer remarked the drumming scene is incredible bmovies could tread where amovies were forbidden to enter and the plot is intriguing regarding franchot tone however i beg to disagree to me hes suitably mysterious just the right shade of creepy one must bear in mind that theres a sort of german expressionism happening here the director robert siodmark was a german who came to hollywood during the war and so an air of exaggeration fits into the whole of this film at least it does for mebr br however its the gorgeous ella raines who in only her third credited performance held this viewer entranced throughout the film a girl friday type with a strong resemblance to gene tierney its a wonder that she didnt become a household name but shes so good here that ive just ordered another film of hers impact off the internet and i cant wait to see it as well
