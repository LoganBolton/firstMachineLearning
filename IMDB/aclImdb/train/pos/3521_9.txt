other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cooks obviously cokefuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performancebr br a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cooks spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupas work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier br br if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think youll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time
