man this is a hard dvd to come by i could only find it on region 2 a spanish import and it was expensivebr br was it worth it well yes not so much because its a masterpiece of film making though directed by curt siodmak the credits on imdbcom read robert but the dvd credits list curt or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries  elisha cook jr and thomas gomez  but because my decadelong curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfiedbr br essentially a respected but selfcontained engineer alan curtis has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a new york bar with two show tickets in his pocket a woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review she accepts a little gloomily the mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leavebr br at the show the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger the drummer in the band cook leers at the silent lady but gets no response curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she wont give it and she doesnt want to know his if shed been a longfellow devotee shed have said something about ships that pass in the nightbr br okay curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence the head police officer gomez turns him over to the da his only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember  not the bartender not the latina star not the cab driver al alp not the drummer  and since the lady herself has disappeared its impossible to dig her upbr br curtis is convicted and sentenced to die but inspector gomez has thought things over and decided hers probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story he joins curtiss loving secretary ella raines in reinvestigating the case informallybr br they visit the supposed witnesses again the ominous bartender is run over by a car perhaps accidentally so hes out of the picture the hottempered latina has left because the show closed and shes uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway elisha cook jr is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group his sweaty face assumes an expression which doesnt suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous orgasmic insanity his eyeballs roll to the ceiling his mouth gapes his hammering becomes frenzied i laughed out loudbr br nobodys performance is otherwise outstanding but all are professional enough thomas gomez is always reliable best performance though is probably by franchot tone hes the real murderer and he fakes his alibi hes reserved and artistic even when he faints hes decorous i dont know how to put this precisely but tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part alan curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the kelvin scale and belongs in a b picture br br i dont know why its considered as classic its really your basic murder mystery by cornell woolrich not as good as some of his others but siodmaks direction is sensitive a man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it his use of shadows is quietly effectivebr br glad i got it
