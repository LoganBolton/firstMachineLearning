scott henderson alan curtis meets a mystery woman fay helm in a bar and invites her to see a show with him she agrees on condition that they dont swap any information about each other  not even names sometimes these are the best kind of dates however when he returns to his apartment inspector burgess thomas gomez and his team are waiting for him scotts wife has been murdered his alibi is the mystery woman but noone can remember seeing her and as a result of this scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife his secretary kansas ella raines is not convinced of his guilt and sets out to find the woman who can save him from the death penaltybr br this is a good film and the viewer is 100 behind the attempts of kansas to get to the truth we follow her through some memorable scenes eg her pursuit of mac the bartender andrew tombes at night and the claustrophobic venue where cliff the drummer elisha cook jr takes her to hang out drink and dance while he jams with his friends this is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a standout part of the film as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the scene ella raines is good in the female lead role and thomas gomez makes a likable policeman alan curtis started well as the confused innocent man but once he is arrested his performance took a left turn as he became thoroughly unpleasant to kansas for no reason god knows why she stuck by himbr br the film doesnt keep you guessing as to who the murderer is as we know from about halfway through the film but this doesnt matter in fact it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story as we will kansas to discover what is going on and then to get the hell out its a good film with some great scenes but although elisha cook jr has a memorable role i just never like him in anything that i see him in someone hand me a necktie
