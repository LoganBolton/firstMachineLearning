i rated this film 710 which is an average of 810 for screenplay direction and 1944 production values and 610 for actingmy acting rating in turn was calculated at 410 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine ella raines as carol richman who was excellent at 810also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson alan curtis was just in view of his naive alibithese two then form an alliance to prove scotts alibibr br i have this film on a suevia film noir cine negro dvd in spanish as la dama desconocida with the original soundtrack ingles as an alternative language since despite searching i could not find a wholly english versioni was however anxious to see another performance by ella raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in impact playing a sole female garage proprietorhere ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in kansas her bosss pet name for her before solving the missing alibithe fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with herhe had however designed childrens homes and playgrounds so i suppose family man had lit up in carols brainbr br in the 1940s with the film code in operation producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by elisha cooke jnrcarol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about the phantom lady alibithe other main character jack marlow an associate of scott henderson is played by franchot tone whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol for instance did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his handshere the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience
