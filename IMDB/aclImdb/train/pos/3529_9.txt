scott henderson alan curtis is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone hes sentenced to die and his secretary ella raines sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves himbr br this was made as a b film from universal look at the castall character actors and one starfranchot toneon the decline the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s its beautifully directed by curt siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish a pen name for cornell woolrich it moves quickly and just looks fantastic and theres the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy im surprised the censors didnt cut itbr br there are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect tone gives a dreadful performance he looks ghastly and hes just horrible also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson you really wonder why raines loves himhes so unemotional but raines is pretty good in the lead role shes pretty and full of life also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true hes hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstatedbr br still im giving this a 9 a really great filmflaws aside
