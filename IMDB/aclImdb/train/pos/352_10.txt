i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that ive seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being selfmocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here br br this is the perfect blend of 80s and 90s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90s films and the stalkingslasher madness of an 80s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right directionbr br denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
