robert siodmak does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raines franchot tone and alan curtis and he does it i might add without a lot of help from his male actors ie curtis and tone its raines all the way a pretty leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her noir counterpartsbr br siodmaks use of sex light shadows and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre the shadows lighting effects and camera angles are all effective but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook egged on by an excited raines its this scene that brings phantom lady into new territorybr br siodmaks commitment to the material is matched only by raines who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man franchot tone phoned this one in alan curtis didnt seem upset that he might die and didnt seem happy that he lived and he never except for a brief moment in prison seemed to be in love with rainesbr br the amusing thing about many of these films is that as world war ii progressed interest in psychiatry deepened but often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as possessed spellbound and the greatest show on earth tone is called paranoid by thomas gomez  tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder but he appears to be closer to a psychopath in actuality as evidenced by his headaches he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brainbr br phantom lady doesnt have the greatest plot but its well worth watching
