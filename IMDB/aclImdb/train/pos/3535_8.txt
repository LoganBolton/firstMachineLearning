 warning  contains spoilers br br first of all i would like to say that i really liked this game i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents i am glad that i did thatbr br first off i would like to say that the single player was very good the first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in london and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime ministers daughter of course you have to rescue her and it is quite a big level but should probably take you at least five minutes the best part and i think also the funniest part is when you are in the jetpack and people are rappelling down big ben just equip the jetpacks most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down pure funbr br the rest of the levels are very good but pretty short there are four minilevels you can unlock and that is one of the let downs because only the first two of them are actually fun and the last two to unlock are just kill 25 enemies objectives i mean cmon we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really badbr br the multi player me and some of my friends agree is very good and challenging even if there are no bots halo didnt have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games you can be a load of bad guys and you go against each other and you can also set traps which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their characterbr br gameplay  8510 levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved graphics  910 there is the odd bad graphic but that isnt extremely often multiplayer  1010 needs no comment just great you get to drive in jetpacks and vehicles sound  810 replay value  710 the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1br br i give this game 8510br br could have a bit of improvement but its still good
