ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60s world the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional i got this game april 2007 two years after release and i am still impressed with the gameplay its a shame that ea will no longer make 007 gamesbr br i give this game 1010 for the levels it contains especially the consulate level i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over the only thing i didnt like in the game is the russian boat level it was too much pressure on the whole i like the game a lot
