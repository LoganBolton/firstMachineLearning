the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy step into the shoes of agent 007 frwl comes closer to this goal than any other game because this time you control the real james bond no offense to pierce brosnan who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to eon but sean connery was the original james bond and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of coolbr br i must say at this point like many others who have reviewed this game that sean 70 year old voice doesnt fit his 30 year old image on screen and this takes some getting used to but its certainly worth it he makes lines like bond james bond and shaken not stirred into a big deal again but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is as bond said in octopussy only the tip of the tentacle the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel its the original gun barrel from the movies then you take on first mission rescuing the prime ministers hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond right down to the classic rocknroll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game as bond infiltrates a secret factorybr br after the games opening the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie frwl james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him in turkey bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey bond must retrieve the device protect the damsel in distress and get both safely back to london bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script and hes done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie the characters from the movie are all recreated well but some are better than others the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny and theres a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny m and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery 007 moviesbr br what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games besides sir seans voice and likeness is two notable features in the game play one is bond focus while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death the other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills when youre in close enough range just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connerys james bond displayedbr br sean connerys bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent so you only have a few gadgets but theyre good ones the qcopter is a remote control helicopter that can selfdestruct and explore areas bond cant reach like the qspider in eon only better the classic laser watch is useful not just for getting into sealed rooms but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with but you must experience them for yourself besides the gadgets you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game including the gray suit from the movie the standard black tuxedo a retro stealth suit and that classic white tuxedo all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies when you drive in the game you drive the aston martin db5 straight out of goldfinger it cant turn invisible but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie and when youre not flying down the streets of istanbul in the goldinger car you can fly through the air in the thunderball jet packbr br then theres the multiplayer of course it has to be compared to the standard of the goldeneye game and it fails also you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game but the multiplayer is amusing and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing the basic game does have other flaws some of the movies most exciting moments particularly the gypsy camp shootout bonds brawl with red grant on the orient express and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebbs bladed shoe arent done justice in game form and the game is a fast play even on the hardest difficulty but overall this game is the best james bond experience so far
