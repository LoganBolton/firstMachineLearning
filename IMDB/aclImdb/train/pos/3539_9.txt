good engaging cinematic firefights great presentation vehicles are actually fun to drive fairly appealing multiplayer faithful to the movie and the list goes onbr br bad main missions are a bit shortbr br this game defines what a good third person shooternot necessarily a spygame is great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer the hype this game had was lived up to and i personally think you should buy it and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one loads of fun br br the sound in this game is a riproaring achievement from a few previous bond games and firing a weapon really feels like youre firing a weapon it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spybr br all in all this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty james bond nightfire game for gamecube
