i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart i am glad i did it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a moviegame remake the bonus levels were very hard the sniper one i think was too hard it made me so frustrated i didnt play the game for a week and a half there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it br br the only thing i might change was the upgrade system i didnt notice any difference from unupgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade didnt seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter i really liked the q copter i think the developers did a good job
